The free races of Eorzea have reared the rotund creatures ever since, though they are now valued primarily for their meat. Would-be poultry farmers be warned: when seeking to defend itself, a dodo will spit forth a sleep-inducing secretion.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">Tonberry&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;Little is known about this inscrutable race of manlike creatures that inhabits the ruins of Nym─a culture that reached its peak during the Fifth Astral Era. Tonberries wear clothing and are adept in the use of complex tools, both of which would seem to suggest a civilized level of intelligence. Recently discovered texts from Nymian times suggest that the green denizens of the Wanderer's Palace are the carriers of a terrible pestilence.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">Sabotender&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;Found exclusively in arid regions, cactuars are known for their ability to survive extended periods under the scorching sun on naught but the moisture stored within their bodies. Conditioned by the brutal nature of their surroundings, cactuars are quick to defend themselves, launching a barrage of needle-like projectiles at potential predators─and the occasional unwary traveler.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">Spriggan&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;Spriggans are neither sprites nor faeries, but share similarities with both. They are known to inhabit rocky regions and the deep recesses of mines. These black-furred soulkin are famous for carrying a gem or chunk of ore about with them at all times─a custom which may explain the popularly held belief within the mining fraternity that they are bringers of good fortune. Their classification as soulkin is based on a theory expounded in the Codex of Stone, which asserts that the creatures are naught but vessels for the will of the earth.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="5" approved="yes"><source>5</source><target state="final">Pudding&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;These gelatinous creatures spawn in the agglomerations of residual matter that sometimes form in the void. Though able to mimic rudimentary sounds of speech in order to draw forth their prey, they are not thought to be especially intelligent beings. As a relatively low-ranked voidsent, flans occupy the tenth rung of the hierarchy.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="6" approved="yes"><source>6</source><target state="final">Bomb&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;This barely contained sphere of volatile gas and flame occupies the eleventh rung of the voidsent's hierarchy of twelve. Bombs must replenish their internal reserves of fuel in order to survive, and are drawn to consume any source of oil or fat that they encounter, be it plant, animal, or man. Grenades, an even more explosive species of bomb, are a place higher in the hierarchy, standing upon the tenth rung.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="7" approved="yes"><source>7</source><target state="final">Mandragora&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;The enigmatic mandragoras were first observed in the aftermath of the Seventh Umbral Era. It is not known whence they came, or if they even existed prior to the Calamity. Preliminary studies appear to suggest that the diminutive seedkin are sentient and capable of an advanced form of nonverbal communication, but further research is required to confirm these findings. The rest is mere speculation.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="8" approved="yes"><source>8</source><target state="final">Coblyn&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;The coblyn is a creature of startling appearance that skitters around on its tentacle-like appendages in search of ore. Gridanian scholars claim that a coblyn is an animal that fuses minerals to its body to create a defensive shell. Ul'dahn scholars dispute this theory, stating that these soulkin are, in fact, sentient clumps of geological matter that have adopted biological organs in order to facilitate propagation.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="9" approved="yes"><source>9</source><target state="final">Morbol&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;The morbol is a terrible beast that moves upon its slime-covered vines and roots. Highly aggressive, it kills both animals and plants with a combination of its noxious breath and ceaselessly flailing tendrils. Upon occasion, the beast will also emit a sweet-smelling gas which induces a deep sleep. Rather than rending or chewing, the fang-shaped thorns which line the morbol's maw serve to hold prey immobile during digestion.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="10" approved="yes"><source>10</source><target state="final">Coeurl&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;Native to the regions of the Near East, these predatory quadrupeds are unrivaled in their savagery. A coeurl subdues its prey by unleashing electrical shocks from the two whip-like appendages that frame its fang-lined jaws. The feral specimens encountered in Eorzea descend from escaped war beasts once trained on a remote island at the mouth of the Rothlyt Sound known as the Pearl.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="11" approved="yes"><source>11</source><target state="final">Ahriman&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;Ahriman are a family of voidsent that manifest in the physical plane by investing their essences in the eyes of animals. They are possessed of great arcane ability, and fly by clawing their way along airborne currents of aether. According to studies of voidsent hierarchy, the ahriman family is of middling class, its various forms occupying the fourth and fifth rungs.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="12" approved="yes"><source>12</source><target state="final">Goobbue&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;A goobbue is a lumbering beast that has a symbiotic relationship with the moss and lichen growing atop its head. This growth provides the creature with a measure of camouflage, and, in return, the goobbue keeps the vegetation moist during the drier seasons with water scooped up in its hands. Though seemingly placid, the goobbue is a relentless predator, snatching up anything that skitters or crawls and shoveling it into its cavernous mouth.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="13" approved="yes"><source>13</source><target state="final">Chocobo&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;The domestication of chocobos in Eorzea appears to date back to prehistory, with ancient paintings recently discovered near Ishgard showing tribesfolk using the flightless yellow cloudkin to till the earth, transport grain, and carry warriors into battle. While the overwhelming majority of chocobos seen in Eorzea today are of Coerthan stock, it is rumored that wild breeds of the species─including those which have retained the capacity for flight─still thrive throughout forests nestled in the vastly unexplored valleys of Abalathia's Spine.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="14" approved="yes"><source>14</source><target state="final">Amalj'aa&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;The Amalj'aa are a race of nomadic beastmen who inhabit the grasslands of Paglth'an, where they subsist by hunting the native wildlife. They share a long and bitter history of conflict with the people of Ul'dah. Trained in the arts of war from a tender age, all members of an Amalj'aa clan, old and young, male and female, are skilled warriors. They also boast a fine mastery of metallurgy, and their weapons fetch a tidy sum from those seeking arms of quality.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="15" approved="yes"><source>15</source><target state="final">Ixal&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;This aggressive mountain tribe claim the wind-blasted canyons of Xelphatol as their domain. Though their race has long since lost the capacity for flight, the feathered beastmen are fervently proud of their vestigial wings. The Ixal seek to reestablish their presence in the Black Shroud that they might once again fell trees in worship of their fickle deity─an ambition which places them at odds with the people of Gridania.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="16" approved="yes"><source>16</source><target state="final">Sylph&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;Deep within the northeastern reaches of the Black Shroud live the reclusive sylphs.

The demeanor of the sylphs is comparable to that of an innocent child, but their propensity to employ their magical talents to “playfully” torment travelers has all too often been the cause of untold anguish and even tragedy for their hapless victims.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="17" approved="yes"><source>17</source><target state="final">Kobold&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;The kobolds are a race of mole-like creatures who have excavated a warren of tunnels under O'Ghomoro, a mountain situated in northern Vylbrand. Believing the ores of the earth to be a gift of the primal Titan, these subterranean beastmen seek to divine their deity's teachings through the arts of alchemy.

They breathe water as well as air, and glide through the depths with graceful ease. The social structure of the Sahagin resembles a pyramid, with a single queen-like figure stationed at its point. On the streets of Limsa Lominsa, to mention the name of Sahagin is to invite dark looks and muttered curses.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="19" approved="yes"><source>19</source><target state="final">Tataru Taru&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;“Deep in the desert of my heart,♪
