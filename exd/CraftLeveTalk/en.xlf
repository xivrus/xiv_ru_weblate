You seem competent enough in your chosen trade. Would you consider contributing a few more whacks of the proverbial hammer in service of Brugaire?&lt;tab&gt;I see. Off with you then. I am a busy man, and my clients are waiting.&lt;tab&gt;You have served the Consortium well. I shall duly note your contributions in my log.

There might be a place for you on the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Princess&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;.&lt;tab&gt;The Navigator did well to guide you here, but don't think she'll save you if my order isn't ready soon.&lt;tab&gt;But before you trade in your land legs, could a lady ask one last favor? Those items I requested...might you be able to craft a few more? There's coin to be had, don't you worry.&lt;tab&gt;That's unfortunate. My crew and I set sail soon, and I've never been one for waiting. Perhaps next time, then.&lt;tab&gt;Such fine work! You are either a master at your craft, or a master at finding someone who's a master at their craft to make you look like a master at your craft. Either way, the Princess gets her supplies, and you get your reward. Everyone wins!</target>

Working as a sutler for the Ishgardians can be both a curse and a blessing. While the seemingly endless conflict with the dragons makes for good business, the extreme location of this conflict makes it difficult to maintain my stock. You adventurers are a Twelvesend!&lt;tab&gt;I believe someone once said good things come to those who wait. Obviously that person did not have orders to fill.&lt;tab&gt;You adventurers are a Twelvesend! But do you know what I appreciate most of your lot? That you are always willing to do more work, should there be extra coin in it for you. Oh, and look here. I have extra coin! Might you be willing to procure more items?&lt;tab&gt;Did I mention I had coin? Well, no matter, then. I have what I need for the time being. If I require more, I suppose I can simply find myself another adventurer.&lt;tab&gt;Yes, yes. This is exactly what I needed. Perhaps with the profits made from this surplus I can finally purchase that snow wolf jacket I've had my eye on. Any extra layer is welcome in this cold.</target>

One can never tell when the dragon horde will strike next, and I would like to have my stock secure when it does.&lt;tab&gt;The craftsmanship is excellent. The knights I serve will be beyond pleased... Now, whether they can live long enough to appreciate it, is another matter. But such are the ways of war.&lt;tab&gt;The very lives of the men and women of this place ride on whether or not I can provide them with quality materiel in a timely manner. If you are incapable of fulfilling my request, then might I suggest finding someone who can?&lt;tab&gt;The most ill-stricken of the knights may not be fortunate enough to find me before my stock is depleted once more. You see, no matter how much I procure, the demand is always greater than the supply. Now, if there were some way to increase my stock...&lt;tab&gt;Oh, I understand. There is more to life as an adventurer than seeing knights are properly equipped so that they might return to their families alive, rather than in several pieces.&lt;tab&gt;Thank you for the extra effort, &lt;var 08 E905 ((good lady)) ((good sir)) /var&gt;.

Because if you do not, I may keep talking until one of us collapses.&lt;tab&gt;I do believe that is everything on the list I left with the guild.

I am certain the list is around here somewhere, but if I had time to look for it, I wouldn't be here talking with you now, would I? How is that for logic, eh?&lt;tab&gt;I do believe that is everything on the list I left with the guild. Now, there's the matter of this &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;other&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; list─a list that is similar to the one given by me to the Adventurers' Guild, but with a few more items on it. Nothing fancy, mind you, just more of the same. If only there were someone standing directly before me with the skills necessary to complete the new order. Oh, but there is!&lt;tab&gt;Well then... I suppose the blame is on me for not adding the additional items to the original list.

The bad news is, in my haste to find an adventurer who could obtain the items Master Gegeruju requested, I failed to remember one of his many mottos─why have one of anything when you can have a dozen? The good news is, there is more coin to be made if you are interested. Say you are interested!&lt;tab&gt;Then I can only pray that Master is too busy cuddling with his latest courtesan to notice the lack of cuisine.&lt;tab&gt;Oh, the relief!

The people of Coerthas can no longer turn away the aid of outsiders if they are to survive this everlasting winter the Calamity has brought.&lt;tab&gt;Your diligence has seen the lives of several families saved, for with this fish, they will not know hunger.&lt;tab&gt;I am but a lone skyfisher, and the Sea of Clouds can oft prove a harsh mistress. It is why I turn to the Adventurers' Guild to help me see my contracts with the valley families are met and that they do not starve. If the adventurer sent by the guild cannot complete &lt;var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var&gt; end of the agreement, then I may be forced to look elsewhere.&lt;tab&gt;Your diligence has seen the lives of several families saved, for they will not know hunger this evening. Tomorrow, however, is another day... Unless, that is, I can somehow procure more skyfish.&lt;tab&gt;That is alright. With the number of dragon attacks increasing by the day, there is no guarantee these families will even live to see tomorrow.&lt;tab&gt;I thank you, and Coerthas thanks you...though it may not readily seem like it.</target>

        <target state="final">The cold of this godsforsaken place has not discouraged you from fulfilling my order, has it?&lt;tab&gt;Say what you will about the weather, the frigid air up here does wonders for preserving the freshness of dead flesh. I could leave this order of yours in a barrel outside and the fish would still taste as if they were caught yesterday.&lt;tab&gt;I care not how long it takes for you to fulfill my order. Just know that I have many others in my employ, and every delivery &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;they&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; make is another sack of coin in &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;their&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; hands when it could have been in yours.&lt;tab&gt;Now that I have seen true you are a &lt;var 08 E905 ((woman)) ((man)) /var&gt; for your word, might I suggest we increase the contract? The guild need not know. I am saved the hassle, and you can have their exorbitant finder's fee.&lt;tab&gt;Color me unsurprised. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't want a reason to stay a moment longer in this damnable cold.&lt;tab&gt;And here you are, the finder's fee included, just as promised.</target>

        <target state="final">Even men of science must eat, but must we be made to forage for that sustenance ourselves? I think not. That is what &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; are for. Oh, uh... Not that the tasks you undertake are...uh, in any way...er, menial... Er...so...uh, what have you brought us today?&lt;tab&gt;Ah, yes. Fish. Always fish, isn't it. I suppose I only have myself to blame, being the one writing up the orders and all.&lt;tab&gt;My colleagues cannot be expected to make the discovery of a lifetime if forced to constantly battle hunger pangs. Find us those fish, friend, so that we may fill our bellies and fuel our minds.&lt;tab&gt;My powers of deduction tell me you are quite adept with that rod of yours. Could I convince you to pull it out and take it in hand once more to service the Sons of Saint Coinach?&lt;tab&gt;Might it have been how I worded the request?&lt;tab&gt;Rarely am I wrong, but that does not make it feel any less good when I am right, and oh, how I was right to ask you to increase the order. Well done, adventurer. I have your reward right here.</target>

        <target state="final">Many are wary of turning to outsiders and unbelievers for supplies, but the lord commander insists that the skill of lower Eorzea's craftsmen and women is unparalleled. I trust you will not disappoint?&lt;tab&gt;Impressive. You have proven yourself of great worth to the Holy See. I shall ready your recompense.&lt;tab&gt;The lord commander did also mention that your ilk worked at your own pace. &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;tab&gt;You unbelievers never cease to amaze. How ones so unattuned to the word of the Fury can create things that can only be described as divine...I shall never understand. Yet, I would be a fool not to ask for more of your remarkable creations.&lt;tab&gt;Hm... I seem to have spoken too soon.&lt;tab&gt;Why, these are even better than I imagined. I shall inform the lord commander at once...ah, after I count out your payment, of course!</target>

        <target state="final">I never met a fish I did not like...just a great deal many I couldn't catch...which is why I hired you! Have you brought me what I asked?&lt;tab&gt;These will make quite the meal! A pity it will not be me dining on them. Let me prepare your reward.&lt;tab&gt;Well, then why are you not out fishing? There are hungry mouths that long to be fed!&lt;tab&gt;Beautiful! These will make an amazing meal! A pity it will not be me dining on them. Unless...you were to bring me more. There appears to be some coin left over from the first order that I'm certain Sister Amianne will not be missing. What say you? Fancy another cast?&lt;tab&gt;Ah, well... Thankfully my lack of good fortune is offset by the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state's abundance of able fishers.&lt;tab&gt;Oh, how I have longed for something other than beet soup, and now, thanks to your kindness and the Minister of Coin's negligence, I shall have it─beet soup with fish!</target>

        <target state="final">Everything you need to know about the request is indicated on the slip of parchment provided with the leve plate, including quantity and quality. When you have completed your work, you may deliver it to me, and I shall see it makes it into the hands of the client.&lt;tab&gt;You have outdone yourself, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;. The client will be most pleased.&lt;tab&gt;I understand that myriad adventures hither and thither across the realm can keep a &lt;var 08 E905 ((woman)) ((man)) /var&gt; from &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;lesser&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; duties such as these, but I ask that you remember many of your clients' livelihoods depend on the timely completion of their requests.&lt;tab&gt;You've outdone yourself, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;! In fact, I believe it is reasonable to venture that this delivery will please the client greatly─which brings me to my next proposal. In such cases, I have been instructed to offer the opportunity to create more...for an additional compensation, of course. Would such a task be of interest to you?&lt;tab&gt;Of course. There are others who would gladly accept the petition.&lt;tab&gt;On behalf of the client, I thank you. Compensation for the additional work has been added to your payment.</target>

Come back when you've what was asked of you.&lt;tab&gt;Aye, seems both Navigator and Matron did smile upon you this fine day. There be more 'an enough 'ere to set us straight, but if you're lookin' to make a few extra coins, might be I's lookin' for a few more fish...&lt;tab&gt;Never you mind, then. Another'll be along to bite. Heh heh.&lt;tab&gt;Never seen a more able fisher than you, friend. I fancy you had these in your nets in less time than it takes to fillet a flounder. And no, I don't just say that to all me clients. Swear it on Thal's left ball!</target>

Though...if it's no imposition, could you bring us more? You would be duly compensated, of course.&lt;tab&gt;I quite understand.

But before you go─mind tossing us a little extra? You'll be paid extra too for the trouble, mind.&lt;tab&gt;Too busy, eh? Fair enough. Wasn't my intention to press.&lt;tab&gt;Everything we asked for and then some. You're a peach. As promised, here's your bonus.</target>
