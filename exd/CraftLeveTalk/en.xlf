While the seemingly endless conflict with the dragons makes for good business, the extreme location of this conflict makes it difficult to maintain my stock.

But such are the ways of war.&lt;tab&gt;The very lives of the men and women of this place ride on whether or not I can provide them with quality materiel in a timely manner. If you are incapable of fulfilling my request, then might I suggest finding someone who can?&lt;tab&gt;The most ill-stricken of the knights may not be fortunate enough to find me before my stock is depleted once more. You see, no matter how much I procure, the demand is always greater than the supply. Now, if there were some way to increase my stock...&lt;tab&gt;Oh, I understand. There is more to life as an adventurer than seeing knights are properly equipped so that they might return to their families alive, rather than in several pieces.&lt;tab&gt;Thank you for the extra effort, &lt;var 08 E905 ((good lady)) ((good sir)) /var&gt;.

Nothing fancy, mind you, just more of the same. If only there were someone standing directly before me with the skills necessary to complete the new order. Oh, but there is!&lt;tab&gt;Well then...

I shall ready your recompense.&lt;tab&gt;The lord commander did also mention that your ilk worked at your own pace. &lt;sigh&gt;&lt;tab&gt;You unbelievers never cease to amaze. How ones so unattuned to the word of the Fury can create things that can only be described as divine...I shall never understand. Yet, I would be a fool not to ask for more of your remarkable creations.&lt;tab&gt;Hm... I seem to have spoken too soon.&lt;tab&gt;Why, these are even better than I imagined. I shall inform the lord commander at once...ah, after I count out your payment, of course!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="30" approved="yes"><source>30</source><target state="final">I never met a fish I did not like...just a great deal many I couldn't catch...which is why I hired you! Have you brought me what I asked?&lt;tab&gt;These will make quite the meal! A pity it will not be me dining on them. Let me prepare your reward.&lt;tab&gt;Well, then why are you not out fishing? There are hungry mouths that long to be fed!&lt;tab&gt;Beautiful! These will make an amazing meal! A pity it will not be me dining on them. Unless...you were to bring me more. There appears to be some coin left over from the first order that I'm certain Sister Amianne will not be missing. What say you? Fancy another cast?&lt;tab&gt;Ah, well... Thankfully my lack of good fortune is offset by the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state's abundance of able fishers.&lt;tab&gt;Oh, how I have longed for something other than beet soup, and now, thanks to your kindness and the Minister of Coin's negligence, I shall have it─beet soup with fish!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="31" approved="yes"><source>31</source><target state="final">Everything you need to know about the request is indicated on the slip of parchment provided with the leve plate, including quantity and quality. When you have completed your work, you may deliver it to me, and I shall see it makes it into the hands of the client.&lt;tab&gt;You have outdone yourself, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;. The client will be most pleased.&lt;tab&gt;I understand that myriad adventures hither and thither across the realm can keep a &lt;var 08 E905 ((woman)) ((man)) /var&gt; from &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;lesser&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; duties such as these, but I ask that you remember many of your clients' livelihoods depend on the timely completion of their requests.&lt;tab&gt;You've outdone yourself, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;! In fact, I believe it is reasonable to venture that this delivery will please the client greatly─which brings me to my next proposal. In such cases, I have been instructed to offer the opportunity to create more...for an additional compensation, of course. Would such a task be of interest to you?&lt;tab&gt;Of course. There are others who would gladly accept the petition.&lt;tab&gt;On behalf of the client, I thank you. Compensation for the additional work has been added to your payment.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="32" approved="yes"><source>32</source><target state="final">You must be the fisher what agreed to help with the levequest!

Fear not, for I have it right here.&lt;tab&gt;The salt air may have pickled me brain a mite, but me eyes, they 'aven't fooled me yet. Come back when you've what was asked of you.&lt;tab&gt;Aye, seems both Navigator and Matron did smile upon you this fine day. There be more 'an enough 'ere to set us straight, but if you're lookin' to make a few extra coins, might be I's lookin' for a few more fish...&lt;tab&gt;Never you mind, then. Another'll be along to bite. Heh heh.&lt;tab&gt;Never seen a more able fisher than you, friend. I fancy you had these in your nets in less time than it takes to fillet a flounder.

Don't tell me you've forgotten...?&lt;tab&gt;Well done, well done. Though...if it's no imposition, could you bring us more? You would be duly compensated, of course.&lt;tab&gt;I quite understand.

You'll be paid extra too for the trouble, mind.&lt;tab&gt;Too busy, eh? Fair enough. Wasn't my intention to press.&lt;tab&gt;Everything we asked for and then some. You're a peach.
