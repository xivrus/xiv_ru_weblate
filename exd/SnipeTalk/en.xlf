As the god of knowledge, He rules over rivers and wisdom.&lt;tab&gt;There was once a system of governance in Sharlayan known as the Ecclesia─a great gathering at which each citizen was given a voice in decisions affecting the nation's future─and it was during one such forum wherein the people voted to elect Thaliak as our patron.&lt;tab&gt;It was not piety which drove this choice, but rather a natural progression of our principles and creeds.
