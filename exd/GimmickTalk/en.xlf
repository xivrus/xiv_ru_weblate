In this battle, you are unable to use the full extent of your powers. To reach Camp Broken Glass quickly, you should avoid combat whenever possible.
If you are discovered, your foes will give chase. The magitek units are especially powerful, and your chances of defeating them in your current state are slim at best.
You may use medical kits to restore depleted HP. While you can only carry a limited number, more can be found by inspecting fallen soldiers or wrecked magitek.</target>

First Stage: Extraction

Mixed aether is put through the aetheric separator and divided into its soul and memory components. Soul aether is then conveyed to upper Origenics for final processing, and memory aether to the Meso Terminal (route and location classified).
Unless expressly specified, the memories of fiends are discarded.</target>

Separated souls undergo thorough cleansing for the removal of residual memories. The purifying light is harmful to organic beings, so utmost care must be taken during the procedure.
Even the slightest contamination may lead to memory and personality disorders within the user. As such, each and every soul must be cleared using the precision detector.
Having completed the aforementioned processes, a soul may finally be made available to the people of Alexandria. Your efforts are essential for the functioning of our nation, and we thank you for undertaking your duties with diligence.</target>

Experiment sees a soulless body infused with multiple souls, including those of beasts, via a prototype multi-regulator.
Subject currently behaves within the parameters of a living person, but displays advanced symptoms of personality breakdown and destructive tendencies. This is all but certainly due to an overdominance of feral souls. Yet while the subject possesses phenomenal strength, it cannot be reliably controlled, rendering it unfit for purpose. Future experiments must focus on imposing loyalty and obedience.</target>

They're said to be locked in a contest to see who can catch the most carp, yet every day without fail, adventurers show up hauling in barrels of carp on their behalf. Doesn't sound like much of a fishing competition to me, yet no one seems to question it.
Stranger still is the poor compensation offered for these deliveries. You'd fetch a far better price at the auction house, and yet the stream of adventurers to the pier never dries up. Maybe they know something the rest of us don't. Maybe there's a greater prize waiting at the end of it all.</target>

There are written reports of sightings in the area, but they're all so wildly different, it's difficult to separate fact from fiction. Some say adventurers swarm the beast and fell it in a flash. Others claim there's no great beast at all—only a grand culling of the local fauna.
The only common thread in every account is that those in attendance have a grand time. A tale more jovial than cautionary, if you ask me.</target>

In a world beset by lightning-aspected imbalance, this means securing a place where people may live in safety, as well as establishing a treatment for the levin sickness which plagues us.
Many approaches were considered, but in the end, it was a child─a youth of undeniable genius─who discovered the most brilliant and complete solution to all the challenges we now face.</target>

        <target state="final">According to Master Calyx, it is not the body which provides life to a living being, but the soul. Furthermore, it is the memories etched upon that ephemeral giver of existence which encapsulate one's true self. Based upon these principles, he has proposed a methodology for preserving souls using electrope technology─as souls are composed entirely of aether, he asserts that storage via contemporary means should be eminently possible.
Experiments conducted on criminal subjects and volunteers have, in fact, already proven successful in capturing the aether released at the moment of death. Mankind as we know it has taken a great leap forward.</target>

        <target state="final">We have succeeded in transferring a soul stored within a specialized electrope device into a mechanical soldier, resulting in full control and function. No longer need we fear the erosion which lightning energies inflict upon flesh-and-blood bodies. Yet despite this crucial breakthrough, Master Calyx remains unsatisfied. He would divorce memory from soul, siphoning the soul's aether reserves whilst granting eternal life to the individual's memories. Unfettered to a soul, memories can not only be stored, but also backed up as data─the Endless will be beings of pure information.
His foreshortened lifespan was, perhaps, the very perspective needed to conceive of such a unique evolutionary path.</target>
