In this battle, you are unable to use the full extent of your powers. To reach Camp Broken Glass quickly, you should avoid combat whenever possible.
If you are discovered, your foes will give chase. The magitek units are especially powerful, and your chances of defeating them in your current state are slim at best.
You may use medical kits to restore depleted HP. While you can only carry a limited number, more can be found by inspecting fallen soldiers or wrecked magitek.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="19" approved="yes"><source>19</source><target state="final">This magitek reaper's fighting days are over.

First Stage: Extraction
Mixed aether comprised of both memory and soul is extracted from regulators and transferred into the stabilizing tank. As hastening extraction increases the risk of damage, the rate must not be adjusted except in the event of an emergency.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="40" approved="yes"><source>40</source><target state="final">Priority Observation Subject

Mixed aether is put through the aetheric separator and divided into its soul and memory components. Soul aether is then conveyed to upper Origenics for final processing, and memory aether to the Meso Terminal (route and location classified).
Unless expressly specified, the memories of fiends are discarded.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="42" approved="yes"><source>42</source><target state="final">Third Stage: Purification
Separated souls undergo thorough cleansing for the removal of residual memories. The purifying light is harmful to organic beings, so utmost care must be taken during the procedure.
Even the slightest contamination may lead to memory and personality disorders within the user. As such, each and every soul must be cleared using the precision detector.
Having completed the aforementioned processes, a soul may finally be made available to the people of Alexandria. Your efforts are essential for the functioning of our nation, and we thank you for undertaking your duties with diligence.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="43" approved="yes"><source>43</source><target state="final">Experiment log 216. Subject: Ambrose
Experiment sees a soulless body infused with multiple souls, including those of beasts, via a prototype multi-regulator.
Subject currently behaves within the parameters of a living person, but displays advanced symptoms of personality breakdown and destructive tendencies. This is all but certainly due to an overdominance of feral souls. Yet while the subject possesses phenomenal strength, it cannot be reliably controlled, rendering it unfit for purpose. Future experiments must focus on imposing loyalty and obedience.</target></trans-unit></body></file></xliff>
