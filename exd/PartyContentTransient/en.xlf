There they came upon a breathtaking sight: a chain of pristine isles clustered about a massive floating crystal─no less a diadem fit for gods. These isles promise untold wealth and danger, and to lay claim to one you must brave the other. Though the deadliest denizens of the Diadem are not wont to emerge in daylight, you would do well to step lightly in this land which time forgot.</target>

These isles promise untold wealth and danger, and to lay claim to one you must brave the other. But take care upon setting foot in this forsaken land, for the recent arrival of errant floating ruins has sent its denizens into a fury the likes heretofore unseen. Perhaps this is why House Haillenarte offers the richest of rewards for information on the phenomenon.
