Its cloying stench alone is enough to repel all but the most steadfast of warriors, and even they will struggle to withstand its relentless assault.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">The Baying of the Hound(s)&lt;tab&gt;Following a series of resounding defeats, the imperial mages have resorted to desperate measures by summoning the ferocious Canis Dirus. Whether each of its three heads is capable of independent thought is unclear, but they are all equally determined to devour as many Resistance fighters as possible.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">Vigil for the Lost&lt;tab&gt;The experimental magitek soldier Dabog has been assigned to pilot Vigilia, the culmination of the Empire's research into scorpion-type warmachina. This unit alone would level the Resistance's base of operations if allowed to draw too close, so every effort must be made to silence it.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">Aces High&lt;tab&gt;Dabog, the magitek-enhanced pilot, takes to the air in one of the most advanced weapons at the Empire's disposal: the flying warmachina known simply as Gabriel. If allowed to continue strafing the Resistance front line, your comrades will have little hope of reaching the enemy castrum.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="5" approved="yes"><source>5</source><target state="final">The Shadow of Death's Hand&lt;tab&gt;The Empire has unleashed the dreaded Akbaba, a winged fiend that feasts on the corpses of those slain in battle. It is also not opposed to going the extra malm and creating said corpses itself, specifically from members of the Resistance. </target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="6" approved="yes"><source>6</source><target state="final">The Final Furlong&lt;tab&gt;Llofii has freed the experimental monoceros from her former masters and the unlikely pair are making good their escape. Just as it seems they will finally be able to put the Empire behind them, the deadly Spartoi appears to block their path.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="7" approved="yes"><source>7</source><target state="final">The Hunt for Red Choctober&lt;tab&gt;Unlike their yellow-plumed cousins, the red chocobo is rarely a welcome sight, least of all on the battlefield. None are more belligerent than the particularly large specimen known as Red Comet, who has been a constant nuisance to both sides of the conflict since he first arrived.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="8" approved="yes"><source>8</source><target state="final">Beast of Man&lt;tab&gt;Known for his unmatched command of a variety of ferocious beasts, Lyon is one of the most feared adversaries the Bozjan Resistance has faced to date. This formidable foe must be overcome for them to have any chance at victory.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="9" approved="yes"><source>9</source><target state="final">The Fires of War&lt;tab&gt;The mages serving the Empire have decided to pursue a more explosive means of subduing their foes.

With its far-reaching appendages and all-seeing optical sensors, it is designed to utterly destroy those who would dare violate the borders of Garlean territory. </target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="11" approved="yes"><source>11</source><target state="final">Trampled under Hoof&lt;tab&gt;Though it may seem no more than a rather large and unsightly bovine at first glance, the eale is in fact one of the deadliest creatures at the Empire's command. It also has an extraordinarily high threshold for pain, and is not afraid to dish out a fair share in return.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="12" approved="yes"><source>12</source><target state="final">And the Flames Went Higher&lt;tab&gt;Of all the mages assigned to the IVth Legion, Sartauvoir quo Soranus is one of the most experienced...and most sadistic. The Bozjan southern front has provided him with the perfect arena to demonstrate his remarkable control of flame and take part in his favorite pastime: burning people alive.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="13" approved="yes"><source>13</source><target state="final">Metal Fox Chaos&lt;tab&gt;While Sicinius mal Vellutus is known for restoring ancient machinery, he is not one to snub more recent technological advancements. One such example is the Dáinsleif, an impressive nine-tailed warmachina that resembles a fox in appearance and animalistic cunning.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="14" approved="yes"><source>14</source><target state="final">Rise of the Robots&lt;tab&gt;Sicinius mal Vellutus's apparent obsession with perfecting his series of constructs has given rise to his most dangerous creation yet. If you were to reduce this mechanical fiend to scrap metal, perhaps it would discourage your imperial adversary from any further dabbling. Or perhaps not.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="15" approved="yes"><source>15</source><target state="final">Where Strode the Behemoth&lt;tab&gt;Chlevnik is the result of experimental combat drugs being used on the corpse of a behemoth, forcing it back to life.
