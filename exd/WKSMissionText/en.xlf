        <target state="final">Sinus Ardorum is in dire need of materials to support the construction and development of the Moongate Hub, an intrastellar transportation system, on-site domiciles, and infrastructure necessary for travel to other stars. Of these materials, metal plating is some of the highest in demand, specifically that which meets the strict regulations of cosmic exploration. We seek talented crafters capable of fulfilling our metallurgical needs.</target>
