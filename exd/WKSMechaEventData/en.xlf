        <target state="final">Directive: Destroy Corrupted Crystals&lt;tab&gt;A mass of enormous corrupted crystals has been detected near the Scream Puff. Pilot a vacuum suit, destroy the crystals, and gather the remnants for processing and repurposing.&lt;tab&gt;Destroy large corrupted crystals.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;Destroy small corrupted crystals and submit the remnants to the field scanners.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;The mech op directive “Destroy Corrupted Crystals” has been issued.
Pilot candidates, please apply for deployment via your exotablets.&lt;tab&gt;Mechs will be deployed shortly. Supporting personnel, please report to the directive's designated location.</target>

        <target state="final">Directive: Clear Toxic Lunar Spongoi&lt;tab&gt;A bed of toxic spongoi has sprouted near the Mush-room. Needless to say, the proliferation of these spongoi and their spores would greatly impede the exploration initiative. Pilot a warp loader and clear out the red spongoi.&lt;tab&gt;Clear out the toxic spongoi.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;Clear away smaller spongoi using flamethrowers, and submit their ashes to nearby field scanners.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;The mech op directive “Clear Toxic Lunar Spongoi” has been issued.

        <target state="final">Directive: Mine Phainite&lt;tab&gt;The Saltpeter Shore is rich in phainite, a resource highly valued by the initiative. Pilot a vacuum suit, harness the necessary energy, and extract this volcanic glass from pits of quicksand.&lt;tab&gt;Mine phainite from quicksand pits.
Ten units of ionic energy must be harnessed for extraction.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;Drill for shallow reserves of phainite, and submit samples to nearby field scanners.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;The mech op directive “Mine Phainite” has been issued.

        <target state="final">Directive: Shatter Glass Clusters&lt;tab&gt;Fluctuations in the Chillmark's ground temperature have enabled the proliferation of remarkably high-purity glass clusters─a vital asset for crafting lenses and machinery. Pilot the warp loader, shatter the clusters, and collect the larger fragments that remain.&lt;tab&gt;Shatter glass clusters.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;Salvage glass fragments, and submit them to nearby field scanners.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;The mech op directive “Shatter Glass Clusters” has been issued.

        <target state="final">Directive: Dissipate Distortions&lt;tab&gt;A large-scale fluctuation has manifested spherical distortions in the vicinity of the Long-lost Carrot. Left unchecked, the effects on the region could be disastrous. Pilot the repurposed warmachina provided by our Garlean associate, and dissipate these anomalies directly.&lt;tab&gt;Dissipate the gravitational distortions.
Nova grenades are effective against the larger gravity spheres.&lt;tab&gt;Dissipate the massive gravity sphere.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;Dissipate the subterranean gravity spheres.&lt;tab&gt;Dissipate the massive gravity sphere.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;The mech op directive “Dissipate Distortions” has been issued.

        <target state="final">Directive: Collect Floatstone&lt;tab&gt;A gravitational anomaly at Cape Geras has caused the floatstones in the area to break free of the ground and hover in midair. These energized rocks are an invaluable resource for specialized study, and current conditions offer the opportunity to gather them in mass quantities.&lt;tab&gt;Collect floatstones.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;Collect small floatstones, and submit them to nearby field scanners.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;The mech op directive “Collect Floatstone” has been issued.
