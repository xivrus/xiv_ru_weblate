        <target state="final">Directive: Destroy Corrupted Crystals&lt;tab&gt;A mass of enormous corrupted crystals has been detected near the Scream Puff. Pilot a vacuum suit, destroy the crystals, and gather the remnants for processing and repurposing.&lt;tab&gt;Destroy large corrupted crystals.&lt;tab&gt;Destroy small corrupted crystals and submit the remnants to the field scanners.&lt;tab&gt;The mech op directive “Destroy Corrupted Crystals” has been issued.
Pilot candidates, please apply for deployment via your exotablets.&lt;tab&gt;Mechs will be deployed shortly. Supporting personnel, please report to the directive's designated location.</target>

        <target state="final">Directive: Clear Toxic Lunar Spongoi&lt;tab&gt;A bed of toxic spongoi has sprouted near the Mush-room. Needless to say, the proliferation of these spongoi and their spores would greatly impede the exploration initiative. Pilot a warp loader and clear out the red spongoi.&lt;tab&gt;Clear out the toxic spongoi.&lt;tab&gt;Clear away smaller spongoi using flamethrowers, and submit their ashes to nearby field scanners.&lt;tab&gt;The mech op directive “Clear Toxic Lunar Spongoi” has been issued.

        <target state="final">Directive: Mine Phainite&lt;tab&gt;The Saltpeter Shore is rich in phainite, a resource highly valued by the initiative. Pilot a vacuum suit, harness the necessary energy, and extract this volcanic glass from pits of quicksand.&lt;tab&gt;Mine phainite from quicksand pits.
Ten units of ionic energy must be harnessed for extraction.&lt;tab&gt;Drill for shallow reserves of phainite, and submit samples to nearby field scanners.&lt;tab&gt;The mech op directive “Mine Phainite” has been issued.

        <target state="final">Directive: Shatter Glass Clusters&lt;tab&gt;Fluctuations in the Chillmark's ground temperature have enabled the proliferation of remarkably high-purity glass clusters─a vital asset for crafting lenses and machinery. Pilot the warp loader, shatter the clusters, and collect the larger fragments that remain.&lt;tab&gt;Shatter glass clusters.&lt;tab&gt;Salvage glass fragments, and submit them to nearby field scanners.&lt;tab&gt;The mech op directive “Shatter Glass Clusters” has been issued.
