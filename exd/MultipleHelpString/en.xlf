　・DPS jobs are divided into the following roles:
    Melee DPS, Physical Ranged DPS, Magical Ranged DPS, and Not Specified.

When the raid purpose is set as “Duty Completion,” the jobs that fall into Not Specified must be different from the ones which fill the other three DPS roles. When the raid purpose is set to “Practice,” overlapping between specified and unspecified DPS jobs is allowed.

Parties formed with the Raid Finder do not allow for more than one pure healer and one barrier healer.
　・Pure Healers: White Mage, Astrologian
　※Emphasis on actions that directly heal self and party members.
　・Barrier Healers: Scholar, Sage
　※Emphasis on actions that negate damage via magicked barriers.</target>

If a party member's progress was less than that of the leader, then progress will be updated to match.
If a party member's progress is beyond that of the leader, that member's progress will remain unaffected.
