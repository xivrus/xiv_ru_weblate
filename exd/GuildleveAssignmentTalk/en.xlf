				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">I have been dispatched here to Kugane by the Eorzean Adventurers' Guild to spread recognition of our establishment while helping us gain a foothold here in the Far East. And what better way to the locals' hearts than by offering them our aid─through guildleves, of course!&lt;tab&gt;I appreciate your enthusiasm, but without the proper credentials, I cannot risk assigning you a task that─if mishandled─could reflect poorly on the Adventurers' Guild.&lt;tab&gt;How fares the task? The people here can be distrusting of foreigners at times, even if our intentions are well and good, but the guild is positive they will warm to us if we show them we can be trusted.&lt;tab&gt;I appreciate your enthusiasm, but without the proper credentials, I cannot risk assigning you a task that─if mishandled─could reflect poorly on the Adventurers' Guild.&lt;tab&gt;With each of these tasks completed, we earn a little more of our Eastern neighbors' trust. You have done a noble thing here today, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;. I hope to see you again soon.&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;0&lt;tab&gt;0</target>
