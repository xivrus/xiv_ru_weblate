As the base of operations for the reconstruction effort, the Mendicant's Court can be likened to a home to us. And a home, if nothing else, should be cheery and welcoming.

To that end, I propose that we improve the ambience of the court by refurbishing the skybuilders' board and lighting the braziers. A worthwhile cause, I hope you will agree, and help me to make it possible by contributing the necessary supplies.

Today, we wish to ask your cooperation in two most vital tasks:
Clearing:
1. Clear away fine debris
Repairing:

3. Use material at building site

Let's make Featherfall a place traders and artisans will be happy to call home, shall we?

that it will be when construction is
done. It is in this spirit that I humbly
ask for the continued cooperation of all
