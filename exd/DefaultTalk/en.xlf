After its rider was struck down in battle, it sought shelter from the destruction raining down from the heavens, passing through the Twelveswood before arriving here in Thanalan.&lt;tab&gt;During this journey, the seeds of myriad plants came to cling to its body. Though the poor goobbue succumbed to its injuries in the end, these seeds would take root and eventually sprout from its carcass.&lt;tab&gt;It's amazing to see such an amalgam of species from across Eorzea. To think that such beauty could arise from that terrible tragedy... The gods do indeed work in mysterious ways.</target>

My fellow Ul'dahn merchants openly despise such savage peddlers, you see, but I believe there are opportunities being missed.&lt;tab&gt;The Mamool Ja, for example, are a hardy race that hail from the lands to the west, and their skill at arms is their primary export. A quality source of mercenaries, if you ask me.&lt;tab&gt;The bulging packs of the goblins? They often contain naught of value, but it is worth sifting through the junk for that one rare treasure. And the Qiqirn? Look no further should you wish to trade for ore or gemstones.</target>

There is no possible way I could be here...at least according to the rules which govern Hydaelyn. And it was I who helped create those rules─at least I think I did... But if I'm here, then where is the “real” me? Any number of theories are possible, I suppose.&lt;tab&gt;It could be that the Calamity has somehow split my being in two─half of the aether gathering here, the other half...elsewhere. The western continent, perhaps? The moon? It could be that what you see before you is but a clone, grown in some laboratorium by the selfsame scholars who created those terrible simulacra for Emperor Xande. And, it could be that this world is being generated by some ancient Allagan machine still humming away thousands of years after the fall of their civilization─a virtual representation of the realm within which I truly reside.&lt;tab&gt;Or, it could simply be that I am a song passed down by Eorzea's bards so often that I have become manifest in a method similar to how primals are summoned by the beast tribes. Or, it could be that this is all a dream...but that would be stupid. I'll have to give this further thought.</target>

I'd heard that the aftermath of Ala Mhigo's liberation brought its own trials, but can I assume the worst of it is over for the moment? &lt;tab&gt;I know firsthand how difficult rebuilding a nation can be... After attending the kami know how many councils, I almost yearn for the simplicity of battles where one knows exactly where one stands.&lt;tab&gt;We must, however, be thankful for the agony of choice─it is the undeniable proof of our freedom. Pray send Lyse my regards. I hope we soon find our present struggles relegated to amusing stories to share over a cup of wine!</target>

As such, would it not be inappropriate to call him “Tia”?&lt;tab&gt;As it is by no means disrespectful to omit the title, I told Alphinaud that he is free to do so if he wishes.
