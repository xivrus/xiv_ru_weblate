You could say Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide is our way of paying respect to those heroes of ages past, and preparing for their return in the future.</target>

To recreate that feeling, our founder has hidden white Archon eggs amongst the vibrantly colored decorations you see around Old Gridania, and employed her most fidgety spriggan to oversee the frivolities for as long as it can stand still. Should you spot this spriggan sauntering about, follow him, and the hunt will soon begin.</target>
