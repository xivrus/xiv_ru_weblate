She has great cause to believe that the Archons desire to walk amongst us once more, for they appeared to her in a grand vision a number of years ago.</target>

You could say Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide is our way of paying respect to those heroes of ages past, and preparing for their return in the future.</target>

Our founder has had multiple visions of adventurers bustling to find brilliant colored eggs. However, as is the case with dreams, no two hunts are quite alike.</target>

To recreate that feeling, our founder has hidden white Archon eggs amongst the vibrantly colored decorations you see around Old Gridania, and employed her most fidgety spriggan to oversee the frivolities for as long as it can stand still. Should you spot this spriggan sauntering about, follow him, and the hunt will soon begin.</target>
