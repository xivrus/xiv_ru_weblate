Long ago, a terrible battle claimed countless lives, leaving thousands of children orphaned in the harsh cold weather of Coerthas.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESXMS2016GUIDE_00366_GUIDEXMS2016_000_011&lt;tab&gt;Unable to bear their suffering, Ishgardian knights would offer these children board and lodging within their barracks. Of course, this was expressly forbidden, but the knights devised a plan to sneak them in, disguising the children in jackets of their scarlet uniforms.</target>

The former orphans would adorn themselves in scarlet uniforms, delivering gifts to children on the coldest week of the year. Thus, the Starlight Celebration was born.</target>

The snowy-bearded captain of the kind-hearted knights has become known as the “Saint of Nymeia,” and children believe that he delivers their hopes and prayers directly to the goddess Herself.</target>
