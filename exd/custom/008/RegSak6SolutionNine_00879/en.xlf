Either way, for we citizens, there's nary a problem that lacks a solution─hence the name.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGSAK6SOLUTIONNINE_00879_UBUYU_000_050&lt;tab&gt;The city has faced much hardship in recent days, but we citizens must strive together as one, and ensure the name “Solution” still rings true in years to come. That strikes me as a fitting way to honor the memory of Queen Sphene.</target>
