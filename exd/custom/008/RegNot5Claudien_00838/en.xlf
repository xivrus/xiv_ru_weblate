So I've changed tack, and now am focusing my efforts on learning more about the relationship between Athena and the auracite she found.</target>

If you come across aught that could be of use to us, be it legends or even firsthand experiences, then I would be grateful if you shared them with us.</target>

While we were discussing Athena, he said that he was a fool to think she could be confined. He didn't elaborate on the statement, but I think there's a possibility that Pandæmonium was built not as a prison for failed creations, but to contain his very own wife.</target>
