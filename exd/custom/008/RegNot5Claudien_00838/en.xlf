        <target state="final">TEXT_REGNOT5CLAUDIEN_00838_CLAUDIEN_000_000&lt;tab&gt;I began researching the Heart of Sabik almost immediately upon my return, but quickly ran out of leads to follow. So I've changed tack, and now am focusing my efforts on learning more about the relationship between Athena and the auracite she found.</target>

While we were discussing Athena, he said that he was a fool to think she could be confined. He didn't elaborate on the statement, but I think there's a possibility that Pandæmonium was built not as a prison for failed creations, but to contain his very own wife.</target>
