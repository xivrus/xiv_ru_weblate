				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESNYR2024GUIDE_00812_DRAGONSERVER_000_041&lt;tab&gt;Heavensturn is a celebration that marks the start of a new year, though the way in which it is observed differs from region to region. Here in Eorzea, it is said that the Twelve select one among them to keep vigil over the realm until the next passing of the twelve moons. I believe this year it is Althyk, keeper of time and surveyor of space, who has been charged with this duty.</target>
