They're just sitting there. Menacingly... So long as they're keen not to move, I try not to think about them. But anyway, something I can help you with, &lt;var 08 E905 ((miss)) ((sir)) /var&gt;?</target>

Now that they're free to come and go as they please, I'd be interested in sitting down for a drink with the good folks from inside. How about you?</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_REGSAK6HHUSATAHWI_00880_HHUTEPI_000_004&lt;tab&gt;With as many merchants and travelers as we have passing through, we've had need for a guide to help folks find what they're looking for here. That's where I come in. The name's Hhutepi, by the way.</target>

That's not to say I'll charge you, mind─the businesses offer me a fee to put would-be customers in contact with them.</target>

Kemakka and his family bought up the land, erected an aetheryte, then started building storage houses for imported goods.</target>
