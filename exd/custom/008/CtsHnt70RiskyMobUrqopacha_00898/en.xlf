Main difference is, this new incarnation feeds only on folk. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction─and a hell of a lot scarier, too.</target>

No, the only thing you're likely to come away with from an encounter with Nechuciho is a couple dozen broken bones. That's if you come away from it at all.
