It was originally given to a creature from a tall tale passed down among seafaring folk: a terror from the lands across the salt that fed on the blood of beasts.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBURQOPACHA_00898_XAXRRUQ_000_022&lt;tab&gt;When the sailors caught wind of a devil plying the same, savage trade across Tural, they dredged up the old legend, and the name with it. Main difference is, this new incarnation feeds only on folk. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction─and a hell of a lot scarier, too.</target>

Everything about it creeps me out, even the name. It means “wise wood” in the Pelupelu tongue, apparently─on account of it being smart enough to speak. &lt;snort&gt; Quite an achievement for a tree.</target>

No, the only thing you're likely to come away with from an encounter with Nechuciho is a couple dozen broken bones. That's if you come away from it at all. You don't want to know how many herders and merchants have ended up as plant food over the years.</target>

Don't know whether he's some kind of evil spirit, possessing one tree after another, or if he's more like a fungus, sprouting up over and over again from the same, shared root stock. To be honest, I don't care. All I know is, we're only safe in those short, blessed periods when the “wise wood” is “dead wood.”</target>

Each colony is ruled by a queen, whose subjects serve her blindly. Until, that is, their numbers grow too large, at which point a new queen is born, who leads half the citizenry on a crusade to find a new home.</target>
