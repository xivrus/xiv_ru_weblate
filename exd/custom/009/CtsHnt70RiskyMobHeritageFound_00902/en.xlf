If it were ever to make a return, even our regulators might not be enough to save us.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_031&lt;tab&gt;Back when they'd just finished building Yyupye's Halo, lightning struck one of the watering towers and brought one with it. A lot of folk who'd gathered for the grand unveiling lost their lives. This was before most Turali had made their peace with the regulators, so there was no bringing them back.</target>

And so it falls to hunters like us to keep their numbers as close to zero as we can.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_040&lt;tab&gt;When Zoraal Ja became king, he ordered that all of Alexandria's weapons programs be massively accelerated. The engineers were under a lot of pressure and they made plenty of mistakes along the way. Urna Variabilis was one of them.</target>

Unfortunately, it had one fatal flaw: its energy consumption was so high that it could only function in lands where the air was saturated with levin.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CTSHNT70RISKYMOBHERITAGEFOUND_00902_LOANYINE_000_042&lt;tab&gt;So the engineers switched their attentions to a different design─one that had a hope of working outside of Alexandria, as Zoraal Ja demanded. Problem is, in their rush, they forgot to turn the old experiment off. And so it continues its patrol, turning its ire on anyone or anything fleet-footed enough to be judged a legitimate target.</target>

Well, it didn't just happen overnight. It took a lot of experimentation.</target>

It was this question that Atticus, a knight of the Alexandrian army, volunteered to answer.</target>

It's only very recently that the details have started to trickle out─one of which being Atticus's apparently insatiable appetite for meat. Perhaps cooking up a big batch of barbecue might be enough to tempt him out from hiding?</target>
