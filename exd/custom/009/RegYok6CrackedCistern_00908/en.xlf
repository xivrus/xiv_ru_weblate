All of us used to work for them up in Earthenshire, and some had a worse experience than others. For them, the mere sight of a Moblin's mask is enough to give them nightmares.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGYOK6CRACKEDCISTERN_00908_BOLILYIK_000_011&lt;tab&gt;Not me, though. No, me and the Moblins were just never the right fit. They had high expectations of me, and I didn't have the talent to meet them. So I took off one night, and never looked back.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGYOK6CRACKEDCISTERN_00908_BOLILYIK_000_020&lt;tab&gt;We call it the Cracked Cistern. It's a community for artisans who used to work for the Moblins, but for whatever reason, they ended their contracts early.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGYOK6CRACKEDCISTERN_00908_BOLILYIK_000_022&lt;tab&gt;That's not to say we've broken off with the Moblins entirely, though. Some of them still keep us in materials, and we give them our creations in return, but it's all very hugger-mugger and arm's-length. No direct contact─which, to be honest, suits us just fine.</target>
