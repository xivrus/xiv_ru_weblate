        <target state="final">TEXT_CMNDEFLIMITEDDISTRIBUTION_00917_PILGRIMMOOGLE_000_001&lt;tab&gt;That we should thus meet can surely be no coincidence. And so, to mark this fateful occasion, I shall make you a gift of a magical potion. “Fantasia,” it's called, and legend holds that it allows you to alter your appearance. May it serve you well, kupo!</target>

It's clearly fate's design that you should have it, so do take it with you, kupo!</target>
