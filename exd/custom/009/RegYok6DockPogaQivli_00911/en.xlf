A fair few of us from the bedding emporium followed them. Sometimes it's hard to keep up with their incredible drive, but I wouldn't have it any other way!</target>

Honestly, I never thought I'd see the day punutiys fly─and certainly not laden with tourists bound for upriver Kozama'uka! I'm still not entirely sure whether the idea was a stroke of genius or moment of madness...</target>

Though I had my reservations about Liplu's plans to track down that former bandit─even with you accompanying her! Still, the restaurant is proving quite the hit. I suppose it was a risk worth taking after all...</target>
