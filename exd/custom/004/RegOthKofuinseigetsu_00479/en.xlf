Pardon me, I need a moment to collect my thoughts. A new era is upon us, and I must be at my most enlightened to greet it!</target>

Though I do not necessarily object to him being pummeled, we do require him at full capacity if our festival projects are to proceed apace. It will be necessary for you to accompany him on any further excursions.</target>

Namazu cannot simply flit about, interviewing whomsoever we please! And I am much too vital to the Namazu's enlightenment to risk ending up in someone's buuz.</target>
