Pardon me, I need a moment to collect my thoughts. A new era is upon us, and I must be at my most enlightened to greet it!</target>

I personally occupy my days with myriad tasks relating to the festival, and spend my nights researching means to further civilize our activities.

It is a superlative source on regional culture and tradition! You really ought to read it, you know.</target>

No one could possibly take us for uncultured with such an impressive symbol of civilization towering over the grounds!</target>

Though I do not necessarily object to him being pummeled, we do require him at full capacity if our festival projects are to proceed apace. It will be necessary for you to accompany him on any further excursions.</target>

My dear &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;, are you that unaware of how fortunate you are to be of a less appetizing race? Namazu cannot simply flit about, interviewing whomsoever we please! And I am much too vital to the Namazu's enlightenment to risk ending up in someone's buuz.</target>

The earlier ones are riddled with errors. They are quite bulky, however, so I keep them close at fin for the times when Gyoshin is irritating me.</target>
