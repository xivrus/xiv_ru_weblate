Here in Eorzea, it is said the Twelve select one among them to keep vigil over the realm until the next passing of the twelve moons. I believe this year it is Nald'thal, overseer of the underworld and god of commerce who has been charged with this duty.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="14" approved="yes"><source>14</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR2019_00442_BOARSERVER_000_042&lt;tab&gt;In the Far East, however, the changing of the year is heralded by one of twelve totem animals. As you have no doubt discerned from my helm, this year we pay homage to the mighty inoshishi.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="15" approved="yes"><source>15</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR2019_00442_BOARSERVER_000_043&lt;tab&gt;Ah, forgive me. That name is likely unfamiliar to your ears. I believe you Eorzeans call this most jovial of beasts a boar. How such a peculiar name was conceived I will never know.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="16" approved="yes"><source>16</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR2019_00442_BOARSERVER_000_050&lt;tab&gt;It is how we create our advent cakes, the staple sweet of Heavensturn in the Far East. We first prepare a sizeable portion of steamed rice and place it in a mortar, where it is then pounded into the thick, sticky paste we call mochi.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="17" approved="yes"><source>17</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR2019_00442_BOARSERVER_000_051&lt;tab&gt;Though you may find it hard to believe, the pounding of the rice in and of itself is something of a spectacle. But you needn't take my word for it─the mochi daikan is overseeing the mochi pounding as we speak, and would be more than happy to give you a demonstration.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="18" approved="yes"><source>18</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR2019_00442_BOARSERVER_000_052&lt;tab&gt;There is one site in middle La Noscea, southeast of the Zephyr Gate, and another in lower La Noscea, east of the Salt Strand. It is certain to be a treat for your eyes and belly both.</target></trans-unit></body></file></xliff>
