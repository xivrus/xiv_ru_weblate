				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_010&lt;tab&gt;The Starlight Celebration can be traced back to ancient Ishgard. Long ago, a terrible battle claimed countless lives, leaving thousands of children orphaned in the harsh cold weather of Coerthas.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_011&lt;tab&gt;Unable to bear their suffering, Ishgardian knights would offer these children board and lodging within their barracks. Of course, this was expressly forbidden, but the knights devised a plan to sneak them in, disguising the children in jackets of their scarlet uniforms.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESXMS2017GUIDE_00440_GUIDEXMS2017_000_012&lt;tab&gt;Owing to their generosity, the children survived the winter and lived to pay forward the kindness they had received. The former orphans would adorn themselves in scarlet uniforms, delivering gifts to children on the coldest week of the year. Thus, the Starlight Celebration was born.</target>

The snowy-bearded captain of the kind-hearted knights has become known as the “Saint of Nymeia,” and children believe that he delivers their hopes and prayers directly to the goddess Herself.</target>
