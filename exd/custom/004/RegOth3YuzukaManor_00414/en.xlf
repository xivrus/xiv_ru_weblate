When the Garleans attacked, it was the Yuzuka who led a troop of warriors against them, armed with the firearms of their forges. They fought valiantly. Yes, yes.</target>

Very hard, very trying. But they never relented. In time, they rose up together with their lord and fought back again. &lt;sigh&gt; Sadly, they lost again, and this time their clan was disbanded.</target>
