When the Garleans attacked, it was the Yuzuka who led a troop of warriors against them, armed with the firearms of their forges. They fought valiantly.

They saw many difficult days. Very hard, very trying. But they never relented. In time, they rose up together with their lord and fought back again. &lt;sigh&gt; Sadly, they lost again, and this time their clan was disbanded.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="10" approved="yes"><source>10</source><target state="final">TEXT_REGOTH3YUZUKAMANOR_00414_GYOSAN_000_023&lt;tab&gt;Now there are none of the Yuzuka left, and we Namazu keep the manor.
