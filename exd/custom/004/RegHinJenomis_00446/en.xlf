I suspect this was a manifestation of Ba'Gamnan's fears projected upon those nearby him by the Duma in an attempt to send the Bangaa into a rage, making him more amenable to transformation─a ruse which ultimately succeeded.</target>

What we cannot be certain of, however, is if the subject must ultimately make the transformation of its own volition. We know Ba'Gamnan desired the Duma's power to see revenge exacted...but did he foresee the relinquishing of both body and mind to achieve this end?</target>
