        <target state="final">TEXT_CTSERKEUREKA1EVENTINVESTIGATORS2_00463_INV00463_000_000&lt;tab&gt;I heard about you! You're that adventurer─the secret weapon everyone was going on about. Happy to have you on board! Fighting's not my forte, but I'll do my best to support you should you find yourself at a loss as to how to proceed.</target>

According to our preliminary surveys, there's a large concentration of wind-aspected aether over there.</target>

Apparently it's drawn to the scent of blood, so if you're out there after dark, you'll want to quickly patch up any injuries to avoid getting its attention.</target>

Almost reminds me of the stories I heard about that other adventurer─the hero of the Scions, I think &lt;var 08 E905 ((she)) ((he)) /var&gt; was called?</target>
