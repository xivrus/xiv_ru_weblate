The climate of Coerthas may be harsh, but one cannot deny that there is joy to be had rollicking in the snow. We wished to bring that joy to the children here, ordering snow from Coerthas for the construction of snowmen.</target>

But I assure you, there is a perfectly plausible explanation for why the snowmen developed sentience and acted in self-preservation.</target>

Forged from ice crystals, eternal ice functions in the same manner as a golem's heart.</target>

If we cannot find the snowmen, at the very least we must retrieve the cores. It would take moons to forge them anew, and without them, new snowmen are out of the question.</target>

They've been especially trained to take part in the holiday festivities, and if need be, supply the snowmen with additional snow. In the event of an emergency, they will also defend the snowmen.</target>

Fortunately, there is a way past this. While &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; may not be able to attack them on your own, the treants can. Covered in their snow, you may stand a chance.
I must warn you, however, that the treants will not hand over their snow to strangers. I daresay you will need to suffer a pelting or two.</target>

The former orphans would adorn themselves in scarlet uniforms, delivering gifts to children on the coldest week of the year. Thus, the Starlight Celebration was born.</target>
