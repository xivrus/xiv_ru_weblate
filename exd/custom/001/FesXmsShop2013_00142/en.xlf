The climate of Coerthas may be harsh, but one cannot deny that there is joy to be had rollicking in the snow. We wished to bring that joy to the children here, ordering snow from Coerthas for the construction of snowmen.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_003&lt;tab&gt;The problem, however, is a number of our snowmen have vanished.

But I assure you, there is a perfectly plausible explanation for why the snowmen developed sentience and acted in self-preservation.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="5" approved="yes"><source>5</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_005&lt;tab&gt;You see, to prevent the snowmen from melting in warmer climates beyond the snowy fields of Coerthas, they were given special cores known as &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;eternal ice&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. Forged from ice crystals, eternal ice functions in the same manner as a golem's heart.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="6" approved="yes"><source>6</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_006&lt;tab&gt;And that, my friend, is why the snowmen came to life. If we cannot find the snowmen, at the very least we must retrieve the cores. It would take moons to forge them anew, and without them, new snowmen are out of the question.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="7" approved="yes"><source>7</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_010&lt;tab&gt;I doubt they could have gotten far.

They've been especially trained to take part in the holiday festivities, and if need be, supply the snowmen with additional snow. In the event of an emergency, they will also defend the snowmen.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="9" approved="yes"><source>9</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_012&lt;tab&gt;The imps have cast some manner of fiery enchantment upon themselves, rendering them invulnerable to most attacks. Fortunately, there is a way past this. While &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; may not be able to attack them on your own, the treants can. Covered in their snow, you may stand a chance.
I must warn you, however, that the treants will not hand over their snow to strangers. I daresay you will need to suffer a pelting or two.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="10" approved="yes"><source>10</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMSSHOP2013_00142_SEIBOH_000_013&lt;tab&gt;The Adventurers' Guild would be ever so grateful for any eternal ice you can retrieve.
