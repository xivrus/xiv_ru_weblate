        <target state="final">TEXT_REGOTH4MYCROSTIK_00708_ROSTIK_100_030&lt;tab&gt;Forgive me, we have not been formally introduced. My name is Rostik. For the longest time I chose to fight alone against the Empire, but I see now the foolishness of my endeavor. And, considering the great debt I owe to Bajsaljen, it seemed only natural that I lend my blade to the Resistance.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGOTH4MYCROSTIK_00708_ROSTIK_000_055&lt;tab&gt;Curious that the IVth Legion would amass such a fleet and yet choose to retreat rather than attack. By all accounts they do not intend to fall back to Dalmasca, so what is it they are after, I wonder?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGOTH4MYCROSTIK_00708_ROSTIK_000_060&lt;tab&gt;I will leave the unraveling of the imperials' plans to better minds like Bajsaljen. My skill set is of far better use on the battlefield.</target>

But together, there is no limit to our potential. Bozja &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;will&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; be free, of that I have no doubt.</target>
