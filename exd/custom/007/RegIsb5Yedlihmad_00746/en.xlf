My husband and I make our living by selling what goods we can. We met on a ship crossing to Limsa Lominsa when we were but fledgling merchants, and we've been inseparable ever since.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="6" approved="yes"><source>6</source><target state="final">TEXT_REGISB5YEDLIHMAD_00746_DAHAABA_000_011&lt;tab&gt;We mainly deal in spices and fruits that can't be found anywhere else. This island tells a story through its cuisine, and we aim to share it with the world. Why don't you try some yourself?

However, that means the port is well protected from harsh winds and violent waves. Larger ships more laden with goods tend to moor at Alnair.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="9" approved="yes"><source>9</source><target state="final">TEXT_REGISB5YEDLIHMAD_00746_DAHAABA_000_022&lt;tab&gt;Ever since that tower appeared on Narunnair, we've seen fewer and fewer merchants make their way here.
