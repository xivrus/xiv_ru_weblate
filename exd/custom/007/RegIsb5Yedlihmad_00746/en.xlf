This island tells a story through its cuisine, and we aim to share it with the world. Why don't you try some yourself? Go on, the journey will be worth it! </target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGISB5YEDLIHMAD_00746_DAHAABA_000_021&lt;tab&gt;The waters here are shallow, so only small boats can make it to the docks. However, that means the port is well protected from harsh winds and violent waves. Larger ships more laden with goods tend to moor at Alnair.</target>
