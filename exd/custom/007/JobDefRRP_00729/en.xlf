As we've discussed, reapin' was passed down from my Garlean forebears in Locus Amoenus. A humble people who spent their days farmin', they were driven by invaders to an inhospitable waste...where they turned their tools to weapons.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="10" approved="yes"><source>10</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBDEFRRP_00729_DRUSILLA_000_021&lt;tab&gt;But it ain't our scythes that people speak of in hushed whispers─it's our avatars.

It takes a certain kind of person─a certain kind of &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;soul&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;─to resonate so deeply with a voidsent.

For days she sat in front of one of those crystals, but heard not so much as a murmur from the other side.
