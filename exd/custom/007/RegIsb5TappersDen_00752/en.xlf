        <target state="final">TEXT_REGISB5TAPPERSDEN_00752_AALART_000_101&lt;tab&gt;Thing is, most of us shouldn't even be here in the first place. We was dragged to Garlemald against our will from the provinces and forced to do hard labor. Then, when everyone else lost their minds, we took our chance and scarpered.</target>

One thing's for certain, though─we can't carry on like this forever.</target>
