I reckon it's high time we looked around the capital to see what we can salvage.</target>

We was dragged to Garlemald against our will from the provinces and forced to do hard labor. Then, when everyone else lost their minds, we took our chance and scarpered.</target>

One thing's for certain, though─we can't carry on like this forever.</target>
