We adapted the Eukrasia spell, as my clever husband proposed, and it worked wonders. His brilliance truly belies his youth. Despite being fifty years my junior, he has already achieved so much.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="9" approved="yes"><source>9</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_010&lt;tab&gt;(-Diary of a Sage, Entry III-)The child has taken a turn for the worse. Her corporeal aether wanes at an alarming rate, and she cannot keep food down, having vomited all she has been given.

We Viera have used this medicinal herb since ancient times.

As expected, it is highly effective in strengthening one's aether, but so too does it poison. We must find a way to separate its beneficial constituents, else it cannot be administered for any extended period.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="13" approved="yes"><source>13</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBDEFGFF_00726_HATIA_000_021&lt;tab&gt;(-Diary of a Sage, Entry VII-)We administered a diluted extract of muscmaloi after the patient fell unconscious.
