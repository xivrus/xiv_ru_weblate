What I do is quite simple: I take any of the materials you've collected on the island, and sell them for cowries on your behalf. Don't worry, I &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;never&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; take anything for myself. Trust me.</target>

(Pssst, just between you and me, I might have a little something for you...if you've got the cowries.) &lt;bleep&gt; Oh, I didn't see you there, felicitous! Don't you worry, I'm just conversing with this lovely individual here. (Nosy cat bastard...)</target>
