        <target state="final">TEXT_CTSMJIWORKSHOPMANAGEMENT_00780_ADVICE_TALK_02&lt;tab&gt;As you've likely noticed, each isleworks handicraft belongs to one category or more, such as “ingredients” or “sundries.” I've found that my team can really get into a nice groove when multiple products of the same category are lined up─and that's when you'll start noticing a boost in production. </target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CTSMJIWORKSHOPMANAGEMENT_00780_ADVICE_TALK_03&lt;tab&gt;When an efficiency bonus is active, my team will take the same product and make twice as many of it, all for the same cost. If twice as many are produced, twice as many will be shipped. And if twice as many are shipped...do you see where I'm going with this?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CTSMJIWORKSHOPMANAGEMENT_00780_ADVICE_TALK_04&lt;tab&gt;That said, making the same handicraft twice or thrice in a row really brings a mammet down. And if we can't get into a groove, there won't be a boost in production.</target>

Products with low supply and high demand will sell for a premium, so I suggest you review such information before deciding on an agenda.</target>
