I am a taxonomist employed here at Poieten Oikos, responsible for bequeathing the creations that pass through Elpis with logical─yet mellifluous─names.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="6" approved="yes"><source>6</source><target state="final">TEXT_REGELP5POIETENOIKOS_00757_ERATO_000_011&lt;tab&gt;Mine is marvelous work─I oft spend my days composing inspiring verses about flora and fauna.

However, “home of those who've a way with words” is likely the easiest for you to understand. We taxonomists express ourselves through nomenclature, after all.</target></trans-unit></body></file></xliff>
