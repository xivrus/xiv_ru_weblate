				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESNYR2023GUIDE_00777_RABBITSERVER_000_041&lt;tab&gt;Heavensturn is a celebration that marks the start of a new year, though the way in which it is observed differs from region to region. Here in Eorzea, it is said the Twelve select one among them to keep vigil over the realm until the next passing of the twelve moons. I believe this year it is Halone, mover of glaciers and goddess of war, who has been charged with this duty.</target>

As you have no doubt discerned from my helm, this year we pay homage to the creature of fortune, the usagi.</target>
