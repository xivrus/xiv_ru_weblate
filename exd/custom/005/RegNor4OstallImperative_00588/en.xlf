Things were all right at first, then I lost my parents, and suffice to say that orphans aren't treated kindly there. Once I realized it was either get out or starve to death, I got out. Before I knew it, I'd found my way here.</target>

Back in Gatetown, people would just as soon kick their neighbor in the face for a few scraps of meol. At the Crystarium, people actually work &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;together&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; to improve everyone's lot. Novel thought, eh?</target>
