        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_041&lt;tab&gt;Heavensturn is a celebration that marks the start of a new year, though the way in which this day is observed differs from region to region. Here in Eorzea, it is said the Twelve select one among them to keep vigil over the realm until the next passing of the twelve moons. I believe this year it is Byregot, the Builder, who has been charged with this duty.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR2020_00537_MOUSESERVER_000_050&lt;tab&gt;It is how we create our advent cakes, the staple sweet of Heavensturn in the Far East. We first prepare a sizable portion of steamed rice and place it in a mortar, where it is then pounded into the thick, sticky paste we call mochi.</target>
