Then, one day, a merchant was gored to death by a sin eater not malms from this place. A merchant who just so happened to be my closest friend. I signed up the next day, and requested the Round as my post. Damned if I'll let another man die on my watch, I said.</target>

I would've given anything to fight by their side, but we had our orders.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_REGNOR4RADISCASROUND_00585_MENTHER_000_401&lt;tab&gt;You're probably wondering just who this “Radisca” is. He was a member of the guard in the early days, stationed right here in this tower when it went by another name. With his eagle eyes, he spotted a sin eater horde moving in from a distance, and sent immediate warning to the local residents.</target>

Sadly, one of those lost was Radisca himself, as he stayed behind to assist in the evacuations till the end. Though he fell to the razor-sharp claw of a sin eater that day, his name and legacy live on here where he drew his last breath.</target>
