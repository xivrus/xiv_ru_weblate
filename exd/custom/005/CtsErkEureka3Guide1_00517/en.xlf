After that, well, everybody stood up and took notice, including the Sons of Saint Coinach and the Students of Baldesion.</target>

It may well be that the authors of these accounts from the Third Astral Era had no idea what weapons had been hidden inside Eureka, and so let their imaginations and their writing run wild!</target>
