Being by the sea is all well and good, but we're simply too high above the water to benefit much from it. The gulls and terns don't seem to mind, though.</target>

Once the invasion was complete, the imperials started digging down into the rock and built a supply depot for their blasted airships. But the experiments were a more recent development.</target>

I expect that'll all come to light now that the bastards have all turned and fled with their tails between their legs.
