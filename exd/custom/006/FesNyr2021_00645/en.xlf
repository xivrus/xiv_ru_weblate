				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESNYR2021_00645_CUWSERVER_000_041&lt;tab&gt;Heavensturn is a celebration that marks the start of a new year, though the way in which this day is observed differs from region to region. Here in Eorzea, it is said the Twelve select one among them to keep vigil over the realm until the next passing of the twelve moons. I believe this year it is Oschon, the Wanderer, who has been charged with this duty.</target>

We first prepare a sizable portion of steamed rice and place it in a mortar, where it is then pounded into the thick, sticky paste we call mochi.</target>

You see, the officials here in Limsa Lominsa have graciously offered to have the rice pounded by a Gozu, a gargantuan brute whose visage resembles the great ushi.</target>
