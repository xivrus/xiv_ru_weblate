I've tasked Gaia with procuring supplies─she turned up her nose at performing any manual labor─and she seems to be rather enjoying herself zipping about hither and yon on her skyslipper.</target>

He put in pineapple as a special treat! Why, it was so scrumptious that the kids and I gobbled it all up straightaway!</target>

Rowena tells me she's selling it for─and I quote─the “almost &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;insultingly&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; low” price of only 300 scrips. Feel free to buy a whole batch─it keeps better than pineapple pudding, so you can carry it around for weeks before it goes stale. Speaking of which, I probably should clean out the kitchen...</target>
