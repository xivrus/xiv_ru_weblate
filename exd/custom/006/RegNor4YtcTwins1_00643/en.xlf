Oh, he's practically my right hand─if one with a mind of its own. He can be infuriatingly cautious, though. “That's quite enough gunpowder, Anogg,” and the like. Hmph.

We've seen that these “machine lifeforms” are highly advanced, and highly violent... If 2P is to be believed, they're capable of some degree of independent thought, as well. The rest is a mystery!
