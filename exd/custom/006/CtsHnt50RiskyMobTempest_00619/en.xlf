There are a few marks that keep mostly to the water that we try to keep an eye on, though.</target>

Which means those marks we thought we'd never have to deal with could well waltz up to our front door. Good thing you Nutters are around to deal with them. What are you on the hunt for?</target>

Well, that'd be because this one uses other fishermen as bait. Other Ondo and poor fools he's dragged from Eulmoran boats, all in service to some long-forgotten god.</target>

Neither option is ideal, so we'd all very much appreciate it if you could go and kill the damned thing.</target>
