        <target state="final">TEXT_REGSEAAETHEGUID_00051_SUNDHIMAL_000_20&lt;tab&gt;As you travel through Eorzea, you will oft come across large floating deposits of a crystalline substance known as aetheryte. The one before us here is a fine example.</target>

This is called “attunement.”</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGSEAAETHEGUID_00051_SUNDHIMAL_000_22&lt;tab&gt;Normally, when one's body is reduced to aether, it will naturally gravitate to the location with which it resonates the greatest─or one's “home point.” This is why upon losing consciousness in battle, many wake to find themselves back at an aetheryte.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGSEAAETHEGUID_00051_SUNDHIMAL_000_24&lt;tab&gt;And, because signatures of past attunements are maintained within our bodies, it is possible (with some spiritual training, of course) to ignore the pull back to the strongest resonation, and travel to another beacon. Many refer to this as “Teleportation.”</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGSEAAETHEGUID_00051_SUNDHIMAL_000_25&lt;tab&gt;What is even more amazing is that when teleporting, we can “carry” those with whom we have created a bond, such as an adventuring party─assuming they have previously attuned with the destination aetheryte.</target>

A great deal of spiritual energy known as “anima” is required to fight the natural flow of the Lifestream and guide one's body and soul to a comparatively weak aetherial beacon.</target>

Well, after the Calamity, many of the existing aetheryte camps were destroyed. To relocate and rebuild them required a large sum of money, much of which was lent by certain men of business from Ul'dah.</target>
