Some call this “returning to the Lifestream.”</target>

These methods have been given the names Return and Teleport.</target>

This is called “attunement.”</target>

Many refer to this as “Teleportation.”</target>

Well, after the Calamity, many of the existing aetheryte camps were destroyed. To relocate and rebuild them required a large sum of money, much of which was lent by certain men of business from Ul'dah.</target>
