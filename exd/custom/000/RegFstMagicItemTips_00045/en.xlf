        <target state="final">TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_11&lt;tab&gt;Ah, but now I suppose you're wondering why all the fuss over a shortsword? That's easy, you see. This isn't your ordinary, run-of-the-mill, mass-forged, store-bought, bottom-of-the-bargain-bin shortsword. This here is a genuine &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;aetherial&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; shortsword. One of a kind, in fact.</target>

It means it's &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;powerful&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;...or at least a little more powerful than what you'd normally expect from a mere shortsword.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_20&lt;tab&gt;A deal!? Hah! Do you know how long it took me to find this? How many parties I was forced to suffer with greedy bastards who kept claiming all the aetherial loot even though their bags were full of the stuff? No, this sword is &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;mine&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, and if you want it, you'll have to pry it from my cold, dead hands!</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_21&lt;tab&gt;Which, in truth, is how aetherial gear comes to be. You've heard of spiritbonds, I assume? That spiritually charged aetherial connection you form with any gear you have equipped? Well, in rare cases, when someone wielding an item with an especially strong spiritbond is slain in battle, the energy created by that bond remains trapped inside, rather than returning to the Lifestream.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_REGFSTMAGICITEMTIPS_00045_GARRATT_000_23&lt;tab&gt;The fact that for an item to become aetherial, the owner of that item must perish while having it equipped, usually means that they can only be found in dangerous locations where terrible, bloody battles have occurred. Now, if &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;I&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; was looking to get &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;my&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; hands on &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;another&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; aetherial weapon, might be that I'd head back inside Sastasha. &lt;wink&gt; &lt;wink&gt;</target>
