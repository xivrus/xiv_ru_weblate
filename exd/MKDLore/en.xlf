        <target state="final">Ketenramm Blaufystsyn&lt;tab&gt;In the year 1497 of the Sixth Astral Era, a Lominsan Sea Wolf explorer of not twenty summers plotted a westward course for Hingashi, embarking on a fateful voyage that would catapult him into the ranks of legend. Unbeknownst to him and his crew, a great continent lay between them and the Far East─and it was not the splendor of Kugane, but the shores of Tural that ultimately lay upon the horizon.&lt;nl&gt;&lt;nl&gt;Having made landfall, Ketenramm roamed the interior, ultimately reaching Mamook, the vast home of the Mamool Ja. There he met then-Autarch Gulool Ja Ja, with whom he struck up a firm friendship. Together, the pair ranged the length and breadth of Tural, spurred on by the same adventurous spirit that led the old sailor to this mysterious isle.</target>

        <target state="final">The Phantom Village&lt;tab&gt;Perched upon the eastern tip of the Occult Crescent, this compact settlement is deathly silent, save for the gentle sluicing of the plaza fountain. Though its stone structures are weathered and overgrown, the orderly state of the town implies a degree of active preservation by some unknown hand. In the harbor, the forlorn wrecks of outbound ships are a testament to the fearsome reputation Shades' Triangle commands.</target>

        <target state="final">The Archive&lt;tab&gt;Although identical in form to those gruesome figures of legend, the tonberries, the Archive is unquestionably rational and possessing of a friendly─if occasionally boastful─demeanor. He pledged to join Ketenramm's expedition soon after being roused from his sarcophagus in the phantom village, though it remains to be seen whether he will prove a useful asset, as the "wise old man" struggles to recall most of his allegedly nigh-infinite knowledge─a result of lingering grogginess from his lengthy slumber, or some other arcane process?</target>

        <target state="final">Iris&lt;tab&gt;This ethereal familiar appeared shortly after the Archive's awakening, claiming authoritatively that the man's wisdom was sealed away and can only be accessed where it concerns matters that the Warrior of Light has witnessed firsthand. When pressed about her own purpose, however, she too confessed ignorance. Compounding the mystery, the Archive senses the same aether that envelops the isle emanating from the faerie─could her master be the unseen hand presiding over the Occult Crescent?</target>

        <target state="final">The Expedition Base Camp&lt;tab&gt;Nestled within the ruins of an old fortification, the encampment is an ideal location from which to stage forays into the south horn of the island, while the surrounding walls offer sufficient protection from nearby fiends. The focal point of the camp is a device indistinguishable from an aetheryte that ought to facilitate swift travel on the island. Intriguingly, these ruins exhibit a different architectural style to that of the phantom village, though when and by whom they were first built is yet to be determined.</target>

        <target state="final">Phantom Jobs&lt;tab&gt;During the course of the expedition, the Archive uncovered crystalline objects containing the distilled knowledge of ancient martial methods. Known as "soul shards," these fragments allow the bearer to wield an array of long-forgotten techniques. According to the scholar-turned-tonberry, the crystals will cease to function upon leaving the Occult Crescent, thus limiting their efficacy to the isle. Nonetheless, they should prove a boon when dealing with its more combative fauna.</target>

        <target state="final">The Lost Citadel&lt;tab&gt;This rough-hewn stone fortress looks to have stood for centuries past its abandonment by the original occupants─though its vaulted corridors now echo with the restless prowling of more monstrous denizens. Architecturally, the rhomboid motifs and cavernous central dome bear a striking similarity to the Amdapori ruins discovered in the Twelveswood. The presence of multiple stone guardians also implies some relation to ancient Amdapor.</target>

        <target state="final">Trade Tortoise&lt;tab&gt;This hulking reptilian possesses a modicum of intelligence, not to mention a rudimentary grasp of the common tongue, and will attempt to sell its wares to anyone foolish enough to draw near. Those who would engage in business with the craven beast should note that these trinkets are invariably cursed. This predilection for curses hints at some connection with the city of Skalla, which once prospered in Gyr Abania─though why anyone would summon such a troublesome familiar remains a mystery.</target>

        <target state="final">The Vanishing Slope&lt;tab&gt;Stretching from the southern tip of the island, this stony beach overlooks the bay formed by the crescent, and on clear days, a bifurcated tower can be seen shimmering, mirage-like, in the distance. The weathered ruins clustered on the shore bear similarities with the phantom village─namely, the inverse conical style favored in Nym, an ancient city-state that flourished upon present-day Vylbrand. The rounded central plaza and overarching layout of the ruins suggest this was a location of religious or spiritual significance.</target>

        <target state="final">Nymian Petalodus&lt;tab&gt;Nymian legend speaks of the petalodus, a shark from which sprouts two ambulatory limbs. Naturalists long decried the idea as laughable, asserting that the myth is based on a real species of shark that uses its fins to traverse the seabed, as if walking. This notion itself was eventually disputed when credible reports of the limbed shark began to flood in.&lt;nl&gt;&lt;nl&gt;As if its very existence was not strange enough, a curious rumor surrounds the creature: allegedly, the petalodus will resist the temptation to devour any fleshy morsel it identifies as a friend. Individual attempts to verify said rumor have thus far ended predictably.</target>

        <target state="final">Persistent Pot&lt;tab&gt;Afflicted with an insatiable appetite for elixirs, these diminutive creatures are technically soulkin, although their habits and life cycle are little understood. As such, alternative theories concerning their nature abound, chief among them the notion that they are in fact a species of voidsent related to the imp. Equally, debates rage regarding their thirst for elixir. Some naturalists posit that the need is nutritional, while others suggest the creatures simply enjoy burdening their interlocutors with unreasonable demands. Perhaps one day science will produce a compelling answer.</target>

        <target state="final">Heathcliff&lt;tab&gt;Almost entirely devoid of trees and other large flora, these undulating hills are stalked by beasts who need not fear the lack of cover on account of their sheer size and ferocity. Standing stately and silent among the prowling creatures is a rotunda, built upon an ornately patterned aetherial node. This node may well be the centerpoint of whatever arcane nexus powers the island's ward and obscures the crescent's very existence from those who approach.</target>

        <target state="final">The Fell Warren&lt;tab&gt;Deep within the caves running through the rugged mountains of the Occult Crescent lies a ruined ancient city. The prevalence of pointed arches calls to mind ancient Skalla, which once flourished in Gyr Abania before the Sixth Umbral Calamity inundated the land. Although much of Skalla now sleeps beneath Loch Seld, these remnants bear all the hallmarks of its unusual architectural process: the masterful sculpting of wind-weathered stone formations.</target>

        <target state="final">Mythic Idol&lt;tab&gt;Found in the depths of the crystallized caverns, this creature's fragile ceramic form belies an enduring strength. The magical runes upon its torso allow it to summon minions and arcane artifacts in battle, making it a challenging, unpredictable foe. Details regarding the mythic idol's creation have always been shrouded in mystery. Records indicate that even the people of Skalla, who often utilized such constructs, were unaware of their provenance. Given that Gyr Abania has long been a hub for trade with the East, there is every likelihood that the underlying technology was developed in foreign lands and deliberately kept secret.</target>

        <target state="final">The Shadowed City&lt;tab&gt;Towering above the forlorn streets and shuttered buildings of this once-magnificent city is a colossal pyramid visible from malms away. Its architecture distinctly resembles that of Mhach, a great power reduced to naught by the War of the Magi and subsequent Sixth Umbral Calamity. As the stigma associated with Mhach's forbidden arts remains strong today, the secrets of its destructive magicks and summoning rituals have been largely left to slumber in the desolate swamplands of Yafaem─and perhaps here, in this ruined metropolis.</target>

The Occult Crescent, however, is home to a sizable population that seem to thrive despite the numerous fiends roaming the isle. Whether they are escaped stable chocobos from the mainland or were brought here intentionally remains unclear.</target>

Despite its mortal appearance, it is no different to the soulless voidsent that swarm the nearby streets─an artificial construct brought to life by aetherial energies for use as a familiar, like as not. Given that the soul shard in its possession allows it to wield a berserker's techniques, it more than makes up for what it lacks in intelligence with unbridled fury.</target>

        <target state="final">Eldergrowth&lt;tab&gt;The Occult Crescent is home to a wealth of architectural ruins seemingly handpicked from various fallen civilizations, and this sense of curation extends to the island's plant life as well. For example, one humid region is home to giant trees that could well be a millennium old, yet are entirely unsuited to the local environment. The logical conclusion is that the trees were transplanted from some far-flung place, yet why seek to transform the island's ecology in such a manner?</target>

        <target state="final">The Abandoned Ascent&lt;tab&gt;Rising out of the wetlands, this crumbling edifice features a multitude of interlocking stairways and stone platforms. Its architecture does not resemble any known style, although it likely originated in the Fifth Astral Era. Indeed, the indigo blue accents found throughout the structure match descriptions of a color reportedly held sacred by one of the twelve city-states from the period. Sadly, the dearth of archaeological evidence makes comparative studies impossible.</target>

Entering into pacts with such voidsent is an ancient practice that continues to this day, despite the inherent risks. Bound thus to their summoners, these creatures serve myriad roles: from instruments of brute force to bestowers of supernatural power and arcane weapons. One wonders what duties the cloister demon was assigned in exchange for corporeal form and aether-given vitality.</target>

The architectural motifs on display are unmistakably late-Mhachi in origin.&lt;nl&gt;&lt;nl&gt;Having foreseen the coming floods, the mages of Mhach constructed a floating island, that the populace might escape the impending deluge. The impossibly tall buildings of its residential quarter made efficient use of the space available, and stand as a testament to the ingenuity of Mhachi engineering even today. The attention to detail is evident in the protective glyphs carved into every ilm of these ruins.</target>

Initially, the constructs were simplistic and functional, but as the Amdapori perfected their craft, they began to represent people and animals alike. Towards the close of the Fifth Astral Era, the creations became ever more removed from reality, with craftsmen giving life to winged creatures and other flights of fancy.</target>

In his honor, a sanctuary was built among the peaks of Vylbrand, and a comparable monument founded upon the shore─aligned so as to receive the sacred mountain winds that flowed down from on high. Although the coastal structure was lost to the floodwater of the Sixth Umbral Calamity, its essence lives on in this Occult Crescent relic.</target>

For this purpose, circular fora were built atop many public buildings, allowing the people to construct mighty bonfires of worship. A similar feature is present at the summit of the abandoned ascent.</target>

Seemingly, their ultimate goal is to protect and preserve Fifth Astral Era cultures, although in a manner which prevents the period's blighted legacy─and the knowledge that brought about the War of the Magi─from transmitting to future generations. The mystery of this contradictory aim is compounded further by the ethereal voice that has guided at least one soul to the isle...</target>

Using their command of the elements, the trio manipulate the weather on the Occult Crescent, having apparently been tasked with preserving the isle's transplanted flora.

However, it is Magitaur's arsenal of dread weapons, including the rune axe, the sage's staff, the assassin's dagger, and the holy lance─all of which date back to the War of the Magi─that make it an opponent as treacherous as any of its more elevated kin.</target>

Perhaps the owner concocted the script as a means of concealing the knowledge contained therein─but what could necessitate such elaborate encoding?</target>
