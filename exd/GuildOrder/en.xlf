        <target state="final">Slay all the enemies, but stay out of the goobbue's sight!&lt;tab&gt;Enemies in parties will all attack at once. Try to avoid engaging more than one party at a time by keeping an eye out for knockback attacks which may thrust you into a second party's line of sight.&lt;tab&gt;If the goobbue spots you, he will order all the other enemies to attack. Use ranged attacks to lure single targets from the pack without the massive seedkin noticing.&lt;tab&gt;This battle exercise will test your ability to manage multiple parties of enemies.

Learn to draw single targets from groups using ranged attacks and engage them in locations far out of the lines of sight of other creatures.</target>

        <target state="final">Defeat Bockman and his hells-spawned minions!&lt;tab&gt;As Bockman sustains damage, he will summon ashkin to fight at his side. Those tasked with the protection of the party (gladiators, paladins, etc.) should focus on directing enmity away from their companions.&lt;tab&gt;The more enemies there are on the battlefield, the higher the chance for party casualties. Those who excel in dealing damage (archers, pugilists, etc.) should focus on taking out the ashkin as soon as they appear.&lt;tab&gt;Bockman, a wandering revenant trapped in the corporeal realm, has reclaimed his legendary suit of armor and now waits silently near the Tam&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Tara Deepcroft for any who would challenge him. Not only does the undead knight brandish a massive blade capable of incapacitating multiple victims in one fell stroke, but when threatened, Bockman will summon his decaying minions from the pits of the seventh hell.

Defeat the restless soul, and send him back to the Lifestream where he may, at long last, find peace.</target>

        <target state="final">Breach the three gates and defeat the ledgeleaper!&lt;tab&gt;Some gates will open automatically after all enemies have been defeated and the area is secure. There are, however, other gates which can only be opened using a lever.&lt;tab&gt;When you arrive in the final chamber, yarzons will attempt to break through the boulders they are trapped behind. Finish off the ledgeleaper before the vilekin can join the fray.&lt;tab&gt;This battle exercise will test your ability to breach enemy stronghold defenses.

Eliminate targets in each of the three antechambers before infiltrating the final chamber and engaging the cyclopean toad who makes the cave its den. Making quick work of the creature is key, for the yarzons who lurk behind the chamber's boulders will emerge once they smell blood.</target>

        <target state="final">Weaken the gil turtle and lure the beast into your trap!&lt;tab&gt;As long as the gil turtle is nearby, the bandits will attempt to heal it. Try and keep the creature beyond the reach of their spells.&lt;tab&gt;Slay fire sprites and use their cores to light the herb patch on fire, releasing a sleep-inducing smoke which will calm the gil turtle, making the creature easier to capture.&lt;tab&gt;Wealthy noble Teledji Adeledji has had his prized pet, a rare gil turtle, kidnapped by ruthless bandits who seek a sizable ransom for the gentle wavekin's return. Always a man of principle, Teledji Adeledji has decided that instead of caving to the bandit's demands, he will offer the ransom to anyone who can safely retrieve his pet from the clutches of evil.

After weakening the gil turtle, slay fire sprites and use their cores to light a special herb on fire. The smoke released should be powerful enough to put the creature to sleep, but only if the turtle is close enough to the flames.</target>

        <target state="final">Slay the poison-spewing seedkin!&lt;tab&gt;When a pollen cluster is released, the area will become filled with a noxious gas that will quickly eat away at your health.&lt;tab&gt;Lure the creatures away from these hazardous locations before engaging them.&lt;tab&gt;The forest's landtraps have reached maturity and begun releasing noisome pollen clusters in their efforts to reproduce. When taken into the lungs, the pollen can cause severe irritation, nausea, and in the case of extended exposure, even death. These vile seedkin must be dealt with before the entire Twelveswood is engulfed in a cloud of despair!</target>

        <target state="final">Fight your way to the dungeon and slay the bandit leader!&lt;tab&gt;Redbelly lookouts will approach at the sign of anything suspicious, and call for help when overmatched. Try to defeat the outlaws in pairs or small groups instead of engaging the whole band at once.&lt;tab&gt;Redbelly chanters are skilled in the art of conjury, and will tend to the wounds of their injured companions. Focus your efforts on ridding the Redbelly ranks of these members to ensure the operation ends quickly.&lt;tab&gt;A notorious band of outlaws known as the Redbelly Wasps is seeking to establish a new hideout near the Thousand Maws of Toto&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Rak.

Once the leader is attacked, he will summon nearby allies to his aid, including powerful conjurers skilled in the arts of healing. Defeating these allies before engaging their leader will greatly increase your chance of success.</target>

        <target state="final">Find Briaxio of the Well and silence the foul hex weaver!&lt;tab&gt;Enfeebling effects suffered by party members can be cured by using items or the spell Esuna.&lt;tab&gt;It may prove useful to divide your party into two units─one concentrating its efforts on slaying Briaxio, the other focusing on dealing with the charmed creatures.&lt;tab&gt;Hostile sylphs who would rather see the Twelveswood burn before making peace with the people of Gridania have begun using their forbidden magicks to charm the forest's creatures into doing their bidding. Temporarily enhanced by the spells, these turned creatures now possess the ability to enfeeble their victims with terrible poisons and wide-reaching attacks.

Only by slaying the renegade sylph leader Briaxio of the Well will the creatures' minds be freed.</target>

        <target state="final">Destroy the barricades and send the goblins running!&lt;tab&gt;Goblin bombs do not detonate immediately. If you find one tossed into your midst, fall back so that you are not caught in its blast.&lt;tab&gt;Goblin barricades can be destroyed by attacking them. They are also susceptible to bomb blasts. Use this to your advantage.&lt;tab&gt;A lawless cadre of goblins has seized the Matron's Lethe, preventing passage to and from the upper reaches of the Twelveswood. Now, all those who approach are greeted with a shower of time-activated bombs tossed from behind makeshift barricades.

Slay the goblins, defeat their leader, and reclaim the area, so that travel through the forest will be safe once again.</target>

        <target state="final">Slay Toxic Tamlyn while dealing with the deadly bubbles.&lt;tab&gt;New enemies will ride stale bubbles up from the depths. Burst the blue bubbles and send the creatures plummeting back down before they have a chance to emerge.&lt;tab&gt;Purple acid bubbles will release corrosive toxins into the air when burst. Take care to avoid disturbing these at any cost.&lt;tab&gt;A massive tangle of vivified briar and vines known by the locals as Toxic Tamlyn has taken root in Fool Falls and is poisoning the water which flows into the Nym River, and eventually down to the Rhotano Sea and Limsa Lominsa. The morbol must be slain before the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state's entire freshwater supply is contaminated, but to do so will require entering an area churning with deadly bubbles that release noisome fumes and bloodthirsty denizens of the deep.</target>

        <target state="final">Extinguish the blue flames to render Buso vulnerable!&lt;tab&gt;Buso is strengthened by the eerie blue flames found scattered about the area. The fewer flames burning, the more vulnerable the fiend will be to attacks. Yet beware his void hound minions, for when slain, new flames will rise from their carcasses.&lt;tab&gt;Each time a flame is extinguished, Buso will unleash a powerful attack. Avoid extinguishing flames while the fiend is near party members.&lt;tab&gt;A terrible creature calling itself Buso has made a nearby mineshaft his new home away from the void. Slay the fiend before he can do whatever it is he came from the dark reaches of the outerworld to do.

Buso draws his power from eerie blue flames which erupt from the carcasses of minions summoned from the void and then sacrificed here in this realm. While these flames burn, Buso will be nigh indestructible. Extinguish the fires before attempting to engage him.</target>

        <target state="final">Ware the minions while focusing on the shadowclaw!&lt;tab&gt;Upon sensing the shadowclaw in danger, an invincible shadow eye will emerge from the void to join the battle. The eye will fly about the field, engaging no one, but periodically unleashing powerful, far-reaching attacks on unsuspecting victims.&lt;tab&gt;Other shadow creatures will also travel 'twixt realms, appearing and disappearing from the field to torment any unfortunate enough to be caught in their midst.&lt;tab&gt;To the east of Dragonhead, near the southern cliffs of the Sea of Clouds, a significant rift in the aether has been detected. Through this rift, a twisted demon and a small army of its invincible minions have appeared, posing a threat to the Ishgardian knights stationed at the outposts nearby. For the time being, the creatures appear content with remaining on their rocky outcropping, but for how long they will remain is uncertain. Engage the voidsent, ignoring the incessant hounding of the minions, and focusing your efforts on their leader.</target>

        <target state="final">Read the bombs' explosion patterns and slay their queen!&lt;tab&gt;The queen has yet to make her grand entrance. Until she does, work on clearing the area of her subjects. However, beware. Some of the bombs will self-destruct at merely the sight of an intruder.&lt;tab&gt;The queen's subjects are loyal to a T and will follow any order given, including the ultimate order to sacrifice themselves in her name. When that order is given, be ready to fall back out of the blast range, lest you take the full brunt of the damage.&lt;tab&gt;At first, the increased number of deadly avalanches in the Coerthas highlands were written off as displays of Oschon's might. That is, until local mountaineers spotted a giant bomb sending smaller explosives up onto the Nail to self-destruct, triggering massive cataracts of snow and rock. Knowing now the true cause of the matter, the Holy See has put a bounty on the floating head of this “bomb queen.” The task of regicide, however, will not be an easy one, for she is attended to by a retinue of royal subjects who are ready to serve her in any way necessary─including self-destruction.</target>

        <target state="final">Adapt your battle strategy to the enemy's formation!&lt;tab&gt;The enemy will use one of many different formations to give themselves the advantage in battle. The Black Cross renders one of the camios invulnerable to attacks. The Demon's Sword increases attack potency, and the Screaming Circle summons a voidsent minion to battle.&lt;tab&gt;If one of the camios is defeated, the remaining voidsent will resummon their fallen companion to full strength within a matter of moments. Weaken each of the targets equally, and then deal the five killing blows in succession.&lt;tab&gt;Five voidsent demons have descended into the Singing Shards, devouring the souls of any and all who cross their path. Early attempts at slaying the creatures have all ended in failure, for as long as one survives, it will continuously summon the fallen back to its side.

If a party were able to somehow time the killing blows necessary to fell all five of the creatures at once, victory may be possible. However, the demons will try and stop this by employing a combination of complex battle formations to thwart their pursuers' plans.</target>

        <target state="final">Protect the artifacts and slay the gigants!&lt;tab&gt;The three classes of gigants have begun to butt heads right in the middle of a Sons of Saint Coinach dig site. Draw the colossi away from the artifacts and slay them before any lasting damage is done.&lt;tab&gt;As long as the leaders of each class are still alive, they will continue to order their horde into  the fray. This is especially true if two leaders happen to come across one another.&lt;tab&gt;The gigants are made up of three distinctive classes: the ruling class of gigas, the slave class of giants, and the hecatoncheires─a second class of slaves who have spent the past several centuries trapped in a sealed mine. The enmity between the classes runs deep, and when any two converge, sparks will fly. But, when all three converge...the results can be devastating.

Parties from all three of the gigant classes have stumbled onto a dig site of the Sons of Saint Coinach. The researchers have all fled to safety, but the artifacts they discovered remain on the field. Slay the intruders while protecting the relics from needless destruction.</target>
