        <target state="final">The Cosmic Exploration Initiative has officially completed its operations on Sinus Ardorum!

Thanks to the hard work and diligence of contributors like you, we are ready to leap from our Lunar Hopopolis to frontiers unknown. 'Tis a dream come true!

We hope you will join us as we continue to seek delightful new discoveries on distant stars.

Sincerely,
The Loporrits</target>
