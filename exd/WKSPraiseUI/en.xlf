        <target state="final">The Cosmic Exploration Initiative has officially completed its operations on Phaenna!

The Phaenna Stellascope, a monument to the hard work of our countless contributors, now turns its glassy gaze to the sea of stars.

Its observations will no doubt propel us to yet more wonder and discovery, which we hope to share with you before long.
