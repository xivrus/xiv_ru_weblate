        <target state="final">Friend! Your scars tell the tale of many battles, and the Hhetsarro are in need of a great warrior today.&lt;tab&gt;Lunyucaua'pyas─terrible hulking creatures─have descended from the hills and frightened off our rroneek. But the herd will not have gone far, which means they're still in danger!&lt;tab&gt;Help the Hhetsarro herder?

And please take care. There were...more than one. &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Many&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; more than one.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;I see. Then I shall pray to the gods that the monsters do not find the herd, for it would mean my people starve...&lt;tab&gt;</target>

        <target state="final">If you're from the camp, you can slog off because I've already claimed this spot for salvage. Reforger's rights say I've got a good six bells left. It's there in the charter.&lt;tab&gt;You're &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;not&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; here for salvage? Well, my apologies. I've had to deal with more than a few knobs trying to jump my claim today...not to mention these damn bolt hounds.&lt;tab&gt;Speaking of which, if you're not here to &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;ruin&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; my life, might I interest you in making it a little better? I could definitely use a hand collecting scrap, as well as scaring off the curs...and I can pay.&lt;tab&gt;Aid the reforger?

Now as for what &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;exactly&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; to collect, well...it's not like all scrap has a helpful sign above it that says “useful” and “useless,” so you'll just have to bring me everything you find and let me be the judge. Happy hunting!&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;Well, you can't fault a girl for asking, can you? Now, if you don't mind, you can kindly get the hell off my claim.&lt;tab&gt;</target>

How did you do that? You know, I don't care, as long as you can bring me more!&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;Thinking of keeping it yourself now, are you? I've got my eye on you.&lt;tab&gt;</target>

You should consider joining the camp and salvaging your own claims. That is, after you've finished helping me with this one.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;My bells are almost up, and I reckon a new reforger will be along to stake her claim soon enough. I'll stay as long as I can, though, if you're still game.&lt;tab&gt;</target>

Please... A moment...
Earlier today, one of our herd's more...&lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;ambitious&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; males challenged the dominant bull, and was thoroughly humiliated.&lt;tab&gt;This behavior is not at all uncommon, but in this particular instance, the male─we call him Hwittaeki─did not take well his humbling, and has grown...let's say, “agitated.” So much so, I fear for the safety of the calves and cows.&lt;tab&gt;Aid the herder in calming the unruly rroneek?

But please be careful. Just because he lost to the bull, doesn't make him any less dangerous.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;I cannot say I blame you for wanting to keep a wide berth. I've seen a good too many of my friends gored.&lt;tab&gt;</target>

You smell of blood and sadness, yet I sense within you a kindred spirit─one I would entreat for aid.&lt;tab&gt;The lunyuhiyshahe are gentle creatures, but the eyes of those gathered before us burn with hatred. Something wicked has bestained their hearts, and turned them against their very nature.&lt;tab&gt;Driven to violence, they are trapped in a purgatory not of their own making. A cruel fate─one I wish to release them from. One I hope you might, as well.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;</target>

Why, by taking what is most dear to him─his children. And that will require the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Blood of the Land&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;.&lt;tab&gt;Collect Blood of the Land for Br'uk Vaw?

I will do my best to search, but my tired legs can only carry me so far.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;That is...unfortunate. However, I shall not abandon hope. I will gather what I can and face the Serpentlord myself, if I must.&lt;tab&gt;</target>
