"","Though publicly known as the organization's receptionist, Tataru also serves as the Scions' coinkeeper─a role she executes with an enthusiastic cunning that borders on the terrifying.<br><br>Born to Ul'dahn merchants, the young Tataru had everything a Lalafell could ask for─until her family lost it all to bankruptcy. Plagued by debt and still smarting from this abrupt introduction to the harsh realities of the sultanate, she apprenticed herself to a lapidary at the age of twelve, and henceforth supported the household with her meager earnings. It was during this period that she met Minfilia─a miner come to sell gems and ore─who would later recruit Tataru to oversee the Path of the Twelve's finances.<br><br>Tataru, in turn, resolved to use her newfound position not only to accrue personal wealth, but also to serve others. Indeed, when the Path of the Twelve relocated to the Waking Sands, and her role was expanded to include secretarial duties, she used her considerable social acumen to build relationships and increase its influence. As the organization slowly but surely grew into an association of like-minded and gifted souls, she was instrumental in seeking out potential members blessed with the Echo.<br><br>After the Seventh Umbral Calamity, when the Path of the Twelve merged with the Circle of Knowing to form the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, Tataru continued her tenure as secretary and coinkeeper combined. When the political situation in Ul'dah drove the Scions from their headquarters for a time, she journeyed with Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light to Ishgard, that they might there regroup and rebuild the organization. Later, she accompanied a contingent of Scions to the Far East, where she established ties with the East Aldenard Trading Company's Kugane branch in order to fund local anti-imperial resistance efforts─one of her many laudable ventures on the Scions' behalf.<br><br>Privately, Tataru has long regretted her inability to assist her comrades in martial endeavors, and thus sought to train as an arcanist. Alas, these efforts met with misfortune, including the escape of her Carbuncle companion, and so she has since resolved to provide financial support through trades such as mining and weaving. In so doing, she has become something of a master artisan─going so far as to establish her own boutique in Old Sharlayan─yet she always manages to find the time to fashion new outfits for her Scion friends when they stand poised upon the threshold of journeys new.","　「暁の血盟」の受付を務めるララフェル族の女性。経理も務めるため、暁の金庫番とも呼ばれる。<br><br>　ウルダハの商家に生まれ、幼い頃は豊かな暮らしをしていたが破産を経験。借金取りから追われる生活の中で「金」のなんたるかを学んだタタルは、12歳から宝石商に丁稚奉公し、わずかな給金で貧しい家計を支えてきた。その際、原石を売りに来ていた採掘師時代のミンフィリアと知り合っており、後に彼女が「十二跡調査会」を設立した時、経理担当としてスカウトされることに繋がったようだ。<br>　この誘いに対しタタルは、単なる商売のためではなく、人のために働いてみたいと快諾。その後、拠点である「砂の家」において受付も担当するようになると、得意の交渉術を駆使して人脈を広げ、異能者の互助組織としての側面を持つ同組織において「超える力」保有者の発見にも貢献した。<br><br>　第七霊災を経て「救世詩盟」との合併に伴って「暁の血盟」が設立されると、引き続き受付・兼・金庫番として活躍。ウルダハの政変に巻き込まれる形で、暁が瓦解しかけた際にも光の戦士やアルフィノとともにイシュガルドへと落ち延び、組織再建の道筋を造っている。また、東方遠征にも同行し、クガネにおいて東アルデナード商会と協力関係を構築し、当地における反帝国活動を支えたことも称賛に値するだろう。<br><br>　なお、本人としては、長らく戦闘行為において貢献できないでいたことに思う所があったらしく、得意の計算術に通じる巴術の修行を行ったこともあった。しかし、召喚した使い魔「カーバンクル」に逃げられるなど、上手くいかず、その後は採掘や裁縫の技を修めることに注力。職人としても一流と言って良い腕前へと成長を遂げている。その腕は、光の戦士の旅装束や、賢人たちのための装備の製作にも遺憾なく発揮され、後には「大繁盛商店」なる武具店をオールド・シャーレアンに開店させるまでに至った。","","False","0x00000004","",""

"","One of Ishgard's most capable knights, Estinien─called “Wyrmblood” by many─once led his order as the renowned Azure Dragoon.<br><br>Estinien's origins are humble, having been born to a family of sheepherders in the eastern highlands of Coerthas. However, the course of his pastoral life was forever changed when his village of Ferndale was razed by the great wyrm Nidhogg─an attack which claimed the lives of his parents and his brother.<br><br>Bereft of home and family, the orphan of twelve summers was taken in by Alberic, then holder of the title of Azure Dragoon. The two proceeded to forge a complicated relationship. A martial instructor, an adoptive father, and a flawed knight─one who failed to protect his family. To the young Estinien, Alberic was all these things and more.<br><br>When his training was complete, Estinien joined the Temple Knights. So focused was he on the fight against the Dravanian Horde that he scarcely remembered the names of his companions. His sole friendship was with Aymeric de Borel, a knight of similar age who shared Estinien's passion for the cause. Estinien's prowess saw him rise through the ranks, first becoming a dragoon, and later inheriting the title of Azure Dragoon once held by his foster father.<br><br>Like all Azure Dragoons, Estinien would carry with him the Eye of Nidhogg─a relic torn from the wyrm's head over a thousand years ago. Though the Eye conferred power to the bearer, it rendered them vulnerable to Nidhogg's influence, and his undying hatred threatened to consume Estinien's very soul. Only through constant vigilance and strength of will did Estinien maintain a grip on his sanity─though there were occasions when he came perilously close to succumbing to Nidhogg's rancor.<br><br>In the midst of the Dragonsong War, Estinien offered to accompany the Warrior of Light and Alphinaud Leveilleur in their quest to convince the Dravanians to renounce their thousand-year campaign of vengeance. Though he did not believe they would succeed, Estinien nevertheless agreed to eschew violence─unless circumstances forced his hand. They were later joined by Ysayle, leader of the heretics, who similarly believed peace an unlikely prospect, but one still worth pursuing in earnest.<br><br>Estinien traveled with the others to the Churning Mists, where they sought an audience with Hraesvelgr, brother of Nidhogg. From the great wyrm they learned the truth of the Dragonsong War: that it was King Thordan of ancient Ishgard who drew first blood when he and his knights murdered the great wyrm Ratatoskr, and subsequently devoured her eyes so that they might claim her power for themselves. Yet in spite of this truth, the fact remained that Nidhogg was intent upon the destruction of Ishgard, and if he could not be persuaded to yield, they had but one recourse. In the end, the Azure Dragoon succeeded in hunting down and slaying his archenemy, presumably ending the thousand-year war.<br><br>Upon their return to the capital, Estinien and his companions discovered that Archbishop Thordan VII had plotted to wield the power of a primal to transform himself into an eternal god-king and bless the world with his twisted idea of harmony. They pursued the archbishop to Azys Lla, where they put an end to his machinations once and for all. However, in the wake of the battle, Estinien succumbed to the all-consuming hatred within Nidhogg's two eyes, transforming into a vessel for the wyrm's shade that would marshal his forces for a final assault on Ishgard. Following his defeat on the Steps of Faith, Estinien regained partial control and urged Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light to kill him, but instead the two tore the eyes from his body, casting out Nidhogg's shade and saving the dragoon's life.<br><br>With his homeland entering an age of peace, Estinien renounced his title of Azure Dragoon and set off on a journey of his own. Even during these wanderings, though, he stayed abreast of the Scions' activities, and participated in both the liberation of Ala Mhigo and sabotage efforts within Garlemald. In time, he gave in to the relentless solicitations of Tataru and Krile, officially becoming a Scion and working tirelessly with his comrades to deliver the world from the calamity known as the Final Days.<br><br>Following his long journey from archnemesis of dragons to their friend and brother, Estinien renamed his lance Nidhogg after his fallen foe. Though he is still a lone wolf at heart, he travels more often with others than before─such as to the isle of Thavnair, where he has forged a new friendship with Vrtra, another of the first brood.","　かつて竜騎士団を率いていた「蒼の竜騎士」にして、「屠龍」の異名で呼ばれたイシュガルド系エレゼン族の男性。<br><br>　クルザス東部高地で牧羊を営む家庭に生まれるが、12歳の時、故郷ファーンデールが邪竜「ニーズヘッグ」に襲われて壊滅。両親と弟を殺され、天涯孤独の身となる。そんな彼を養ったのが、時の「蒼の竜騎士」アルベリクだった。エスティニアンにとってアルベリクは、故郷を守れなかった男であると同時に、復讐の力となる槍術の師匠であり、第二の父親でもあるという複雑な関係である。<br><br>　そんな男の下で黙々と修行を続けた彼は、やがて神殿騎士団へと入隊。そこでもまた竜を狩ることだけに執着し続け、同じ部隊の仲間の名すら覚えない程であったという。だが、同じく隊内で浮いた存在であった若き神殿騎士アイメリクとは、年が近いこともあってか馬があい、竜との死闘を経て親友と呼べる間柄となる。その後、竜狩りの功績が認められて竜騎士団への入団を許された彼は、やがて仇たるニーズヘッグから引き抜かれたとされる秘宝「竜の眼」に認められ、その力を利用して戦う「蒼の竜騎士」の称号を得たのだった。<br><br>　莫大な魔力を有する「竜の眼」は強大な力を与えると同時に使い手の精神を蝕む、正に諸刃の剣である。エスティニアンが半ばニーズヘッグに魅入られながらも、どうにか正気を保てた背景に師と友の存在があったことは疑いの余地がない。加えて、皇都に来訪した光の戦士とアルフィノ、そして敵として出会ったイゼルの存在もまた、彼の人生に大きな影響を与えた。<br>　エスティニアンは彼らとともに、竜の根拠地たるドラヴァニア雲海へと向かったのだ。この旅で彼は聖竜フレースヴェルグから、竜詩戦争の発端となった真実、すなわち古のイシュガルド王トールダンによる詩竜ラタトスク謀殺の事実を知り、また仇として追い続けていたニーズヘッグの討伐を成し遂げる。これが竜詩戦争の終結とイシュガルドの変革に大きく寄与したことは周知のとおりである。<br><br>　この後も、エスティニアンは光の戦士たちに同行。蛮神を利用した強制教化による恒久平和の実現を目論むトールダン7世の追撃に協力したが、この戦いの果てに、ふたつのニーズヘッグの眼を手にしたことで肉体を乗っ取られ、「邪竜の影」と化してしまう。かくして祖国の敵となった彼であったが、旅の仲間たちと親友の尽力により、後に救われることとなる。<br><br>　その後、彼は祖国の共和制への移行を見届けると、兜を置いて出奔。これ以降は気ままな旅を続け、陰ながら光の戦士たちのアラミゴ攻めを支援するなどした。だが、タタルとクルルからの猛烈な勧誘に屈して帝都ガレマルドの調査に協力した後、正式に「暁の血盟」に加入。終末を巡る旅にも同行した。<br><br>　なお、彼は仇敵の血で濡れた竜槍を「魔槍ニーズヘッグ」と名付け、そのまま使い続けている。またサベネア島で出会った星竜ヴリトラとは、奇妙な友人関係を構築するなど、今なお七大天竜との縁が深いようだ。","","False","0x0000000E","",""

"","A relatively recent addition to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, G'raha Tia hails from Corvos in southern Ilsabard, where the Allagan Empire once flourished during the Third Astral Era. Although the Miqo'te were once forced to toil in obscurity for the glory of Allag, G'raha Tia's tribe, ever proud, devoted themselves to the study and preservation of arcane secrets. Thousands of years later, when Corvos was conquered by the Garleans and brought under the jurisdiction of the illustrious House Darnus, a young G'raha─heir to vast stores of Allagan knowledge and the last child born with the Allagan Eye, was given into the custody of the Students of Baldesion.<br><br>After acquiring Sharlayan citizenship and freedom from more mundane duties, G'raha concentrated on his education, earning his Archon's mark for his groundbreaking research into ancient arcane wisdom. Owing to these qualifications, G'raha Tia was tasked with the vital duty of investigating the Crystal Tower, the most fascinating and forbidding of the surviving relics of the Allagan Empire. It was during this expedition that he met with Rammbroes of the Sons of Saint Coinach, Cid Garlond of the Ironworks, and the Warrior of Light─an occasion which led to the formation of the fellowship known as NOAH.<br><br>With his newfound companions he laid bare the secrets of ancient Allag, and learned from the awakened clones Unei and Doga that the eye he inherited was in truth the Royal Eye, the unmistakable mark of the Allagan imperial family. With it, he could control the Crystal Tower itself, per the wishes of Salina, the final princess of Allag, who had chosen to pass down this gift and place her trust in future generations.<br><br>Judging that mankind was not yet ready for the secrets of the Crystal Tower, G'raha Tia sealed himself within it, in the hope that he might awaken in an age when his fellow man had set aside their differences─when they might truly comprehend and wield the Allagan knowledge for the benefit of all.<br><br>Alas, when G'raha awoke from his slumber two hundred years later, the world had been ravaged by tragedy and death, for the Eighth Umbral Calamity had come to pass. Biggs─third of his name and eighteenth chairman of Garlond Ironworks─had cracked the tower's wards, seeking to harness the power within to develop a means of time travel, that they might forge a future in which the Calamity had never occurred. G'raha agreed to lend them his aid, and so it was that he and the Crystal Tower were transported into the past─not of their world, the Source, but of the reflection known as the First, where fate would once again see him reunited with the Warrior of Light.<br><br>The First, for its part, had suffered a calamity no less daunting than that of the Source. A Flood of Light had nearly extinguished all life, and what little remained was beset by horrors born of the phenomenon known as sin eaters. Unaged due to his symbiosis with the Crystal Tower, an ever-youthful G'raha Tia took the initiative in building the Crystarium─a city and bulwark of hope where he and his growing community would stand against these foes.<br><br>For a hundred years, the Crystal Exarch─as G'raha Tia had come to be known─laid the groundwork for the coming battle, for he had always known that he could not triumph without the Warrior of Light. When the time came, he summoned the champion and their allies─albeit accidentally─from the Source, assembling a formidable alliance to take up arms against the Lightwardens and reclaim the long-absent night sky.<br><br>The final step in G'raha Tia's plan would have seen him render up his own life for the preservation of the First and the Source. Blessedly, this sacrifice did not come to pass. Ultimately, the Warrior of Light and their brave companions succeeded in laying low the Ascians Emet-Selch and Elidibus, ending the threat of an Eighth Umbral Calamity and giving the First hope for a brighter tomorrow.<br><br>When the Scions at last returned to their own world, they did not do so alone. G'raha Tia had conceived a method in which his memories and essence in the First could be merged with his past self still sleeping within the Crystal Tower of the Source. The awoken G'raha Tia eagerly joined the ranks of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and proceeded to employ his ample knowledge of all things Allagan, as well as the leadership skills he honed as the Crystal Exarch, to provide invaluable guidance and support to his companions. In particular, his decisive actions in Thavnair during the Final Days ensured the survival of countless innocents.<br><br>After the de facto disbanding of the Scions, G'raha Tia joined Krile in helping to rebuild the Students of Baldesion.

Resentful of having to mind a child instead of pursuing her own research, the revered Archon was a stern taskmaster, imposing upon her new student one harsh trial after the next. Y'shtola, for her part, did not shirk from these formidable tasks, eventually winning the approval of her mentor—who doubtless saw in the stubborn Miqo'te girl shades of her own self as a child. After ten years of training, Y'shtola emerged from Matoya's cave a woman grown, possessed of vast knowledge and skill in the arcane that easily earned her the title of Archon.<br><br>Striking out on her own, Y'shtola joined the Circle of Knowing, led by her mentor's colleague and friend Louisoix Leveilleur.

Left to wander the Lifestream as a result of this, she was on the verge of being lost forever to the aetheric currents when she was rescued and called back to this world through the efforts of Kan-E-Senna and the Warrior of Light. Y'shtola awoke from her coma to find she had lost the physical ability of sight, gaining in its stead the power to see aether in the environment around her.

Eastern, Western, modern, historical─the young Elezen devoured all manner of sources concerning his favorite subject, though in so doing acquired an erudite vocabulary and poetic mannerisms that alienated his peers. His steadfast studiousness─along with the encouragement of his childhood friend, Moenbryda─did, however, enable him to enter the Studium under the auspices of the foremost authority on prophecy, Archon Louisoix. Indeed, it is thought that Urianger elected to join the Circle of Knowing to learn the truth of Mezaya Thousand Eyes's <var 1A 02 /var>Divine Chronicles<var 1A 01 /var>, a work that hinted at the coming of the Seventh Umbral Calamity.<br><br>In the moons preceding said Calamity, Urianger sought to share his knowledge with the people of Eorzea, but his doomsaying only served to earn him an unflattering reputation.

After divulging his true identity as G'raha Tia, the Exarch implored him to pretend that his own knowledge of future tragedies was a vision Urianger had witnessed when passing between worlds.
