"","Though publicly known as the organization's receptionist, Tataru also serves as the Scions' coinkeeper─a role she executes with an enthusiastic cunning that borders on the terrifying.

Born to Ul'dahn merchants, the young Tataru had everything a Lalafell could ask for─until her family lost it all to bankruptcy. Plagued by debt and still smarting from this abrupt introduction to the harsh realities of the sultanate, she apprenticed herself to a lapidary at the age of twelve, and henceforth supported the household with her meager earnings. It was during this period that she met Minfilia─a miner come to sell gems and ore─who would later recruit Tataru to oversee the Path of the Twelve's finances.

Tataru, in turn, resolved to use her newfound position not only to accrue personal wealth, but also to serve others. Indeed, when the Path of the Twelve relocated to the Waking Sands, and her role was expanded to include secretarial duties, she used her considerable social acumen to build relationships and increase its influence. As the organization slowly but surely grew into an association of like-minded and gifted souls, she was instrumental in seeking out potential members blessed with the Echo.

After the Seventh Umbral Calamity, when the Path of the Twelve merged with the Circle of Knowing to form the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, Tataru continued her tenure as secretary and coinkeeper combined. When the political situation in Ul'dah drove the Scions from their headquarters for a time, she journeyed with Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light to Ishgard, that they might there regroup and rebuild the organization. Later, she accompanied a contingent of Scions to the Far East, where she established ties with the East Aldenard Trading Company's Kugane branch in order to fund local anti-imperial resistance efforts─one of her many laudable ventures on the Scions' behalf.

Privately, Tataru has long regretted her inability to assist her comrades in martial endeavors, and thus sought to train as an arcanist. Alas, these efforts met with misfortune, including the escape of her Carbuncle companion, and so she has since resolved to provide financial support through trades such as mining and weaving. In so doing, she has become something of a master artisan─going so far as to establish her own boutique in Old Sharlayan─yet she always manages to find the time to fashion new outfits for her Scion friends when they stand poised upon the threshold of journeys new.","　「暁の血盟」の受付を務めるララフェル族の女性。経理も務めるため、暁の金庫番とも呼ばれる。

　ウルダハの商家に生まれ、幼い頃は豊かな暮らしをしていたが破産を経験。借金取りから追われる生活の中で「金」のなんたるかを学んだタタルは、12歳から宝石商に丁稚奉公し、わずかな給金で貧しい家計を支えてきた。その際、原石を売りに来ていた採掘師時代のミンフィリアと知り合っており、後に彼女が「十二跡調査会」を設立した時、経理担当としてスカウトされることに繋がったようだ。
　この誘いに対しタタルは、単なる商売のためではなく、人のために働いてみたいと快諾。その後、拠点である「砂の家」において受付も担当するようになると、得意の交渉術を駆使して人脈を広げ、異能者の互助組織としての側面を持つ同組織において「超える力」保有者の発見にも貢献した。

"","This secret society was the product of a merger between the Circle of Knowing, led by Louisoix Leveilleur, and the Path of the Twelve, led by Minfilia Warde, following the Seventh Umbral Calamity.

Working in concert with the leaders of Eorzea, the Scions strove to address the myriad problems that plagued the realm, be it the godlike primals, the imperialistic Garleans, or the scheming Ascians─beings who have long shaped history from the shadows. As a means to achieve its objectives, the society sought out those blessed with the Echo, a mysterious power with myriad manifestations, the most notable of which was the ability to walk in the memories of others. It was for this reason they extended an invitation to the Warrior of Light.

On account of their contributions in dealing with several primals and the XIVth Imperial Legion, the Scions' existence became public knowledge. Utilizing their newfound reputation, Alphinaud Leveilleur founded the Crystal Braves, a military organization intended to pave the way for a unified Eorzea. However, the society's activities had made it the target of a Monetarist faction of Ul'dah, and an elaborate betrayal by Alphinaud's presumed allies resulted in the Scions being framed for the sultana's assassination. Though branded fugitives and scattered for a time, they eventually learned of a plot within a plot that saw the monarch put into a deep slumber rather than slain, and succeeded in clearing their names.

Their honor restored, the Scions went on to become key players in the liberation of Ala Mhigo and Doma from imperial rule, and after helping to avert the Final Days, they judged their mission fulfilled. So it was that they announced their disbandment─at least outwardly─and retreated from plain sight to labor in secret once more.","　ルイゾワ・ルヴェユールがエオルゼアの救済を目的として立ち上げた「救世詩盟」と、ミンフィリア・ウォードが設立した「十二跡調査会」が、第七霊災の後に合併する形で成立した秘密結社。

"","This dreadful calamity befell the star in the distant past, when it was known as Etheirys.

In that shining age, men had the power to manifest anything at will, even living beings, and through this miraculous creation magick, their civilization thrived. One day, however, following a keening sound from the land, their magicks ran rampant, giving form to eldritch horrors born of fear and despair. Their blissful lives became a waking nightmare, and mankind was driven to the brink of extinction.

The Convocation of Fourteen, the people's chosen representatives, observed that the phenomenon manifested where the celestial currents, the star's outermost flow of aether, had grown weak and stagnant. In order to address this deficiency, they summoned forth the mighty Zodiark to exert control over the laws of creation. Though this act demanded a high price─the sacrifice of half of mankind's remaining number─the vast majority willingly rendered up their lives, and thus were the Final Days forestalled.

Over the intervening millennia, this star-encompassing calamity had faded from memory. But faced with its second coming as engineered by the Telophoroi, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn embarked upon a desperate quest for the truth. At length, they discovered that an ancient named Hermes had created Meteion, a being capable of traversing the great expanse, to ascertain the meaning of life by seeking out other civilizations in the universe. Alas, Meteion and her sisters found naught but despair, driving them to conclude life was suffering and death the sole mercy. Fleeing to the edge of existence, they became the Endsinger, and proceeded to unleash the power of dynamis, an esoteric energy set in motion by feelings, to usher all stars to their doom, that life need not continue in vain.

Despite seemingly insurmountable odds, the Scions held fast to hope, and amidst darkest despair lit the way for their champion as they confronted the Endsinger at her nest. And at the end of a fierce battle, they emerged triumphant, and put an end to the Final Days once and for all.","　古の昔、「アーテリス」と呼ばれていた星を襲った破滅的な災厄のこと。

"","One of Ishgard's most capable knights, Estinien─called “Wyrmblood” by many─once led his order as the renowned Azure Dragoon.

Estinien's origins are humble, having been born to a family of sheepherders in the eastern highlands of Coerthas. However, the course of his pastoral life was forever changed when his village of Ferndale was razed by the great wyrm Nidhogg─an attack which claimed the lives of his parents and his brother.

Bereft of home and family, the orphan of twelve summers was taken in by Alberic, then holder of the title of Azure Dragoon. The two proceeded to forge a complicated relationship. A martial instructor, an adoptive father, and a flawed knight─one who failed to protect his family. To the young Estinien, Alberic was all these things and more.

When his training was complete, Estinien joined the Temple Knights. So focused was he on the fight against the Dravanian Horde that he scarcely remembered the names of his companions. His sole friendship was with Aymeric de Borel, a knight of similar age who shared Estinien's passion for the cause. Estinien's prowess saw him rise through the ranks, first becoming a dragoon, and later inheriting the title of Azure Dragoon once held by his foster father.

Like all Azure Dragoons, Estinien would carry with him the Eye of Nidhogg─a relic torn from the wyrm's head over a thousand years ago. Though the Eye conferred power to the bearer, it rendered them vulnerable to Nidhogg's influence, and his undying hatred threatened to consume Estinien's very soul. Only through constant vigilance and strength of will did Estinien maintain a grip on his sanity─though there were occasions when he came perilously close to succumbing to Nidhogg's rancor.

In the midst of the Dragonsong War, Estinien offered to accompany the Warrior of Light and Alphinaud Leveilleur in their quest to convince the Dravanians to renounce their thousand-year campaign of vengeance. Though he did not believe they would succeed, Estinien nevertheless agreed to eschew violence─unless circumstances forced his hand. They were later joined by Ysayle, leader of the heretics, who similarly believed peace an unlikely prospect, but one still worth pursuing in earnest.

Estinien traveled with the others to the Churning Mists, where they sought an audience with Hraesvelgr, brother of Nidhogg. From the great wyrm they learned the truth of the Dragonsong War: that it was King Thordan of ancient Ishgard who drew first blood when he and his knights murdered the great wyrm Ratatoskr, and subsequently devoured her eyes so that they might claim her power for themselves. Yet in spite of this truth, the fact remained that Nidhogg was intent upon the destruction of Ishgard, and if he could not be persuaded to yield, they had but one recourse. In the end, the Azure Dragoon succeeded in hunting down and slaying his archenemy, presumably ending the thousand-year war.

Upon their return to the capital, Estinien and his companions discovered that Archbishop Thordan VII had plotted to wield the power of a primal to transform himself into an eternal god-king and bless the world with his twisted idea of harmony. They pursued the archbishop to Azys Lla, where they put an end to his machinations once and for all. However, in the wake of the battle, Estinien succumbed to the all-consuming hatred within Nidhogg's two eyes, transforming into a vessel for the wyrm's shade that would marshal his forces for a final assault on Ishgard. Following his defeat on the Steps of Faith, Estinien regained partial control and urged Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light to kill him, but instead the two tore the eyes from his body, casting out Nidhogg's shade and saving the dragoon's life.

With his homeland entering an age of peace, Estinien renounced his title of Azure Dragoon and set off on a journey of his own. Even during these wanderings, though, he stayed abreast of the Scions' activities, and participated in both the liberation of Ala Mhigo and sabotage efforts within Garlemald. In time, he gave in to the relentless solicitations of Tataru and Krile, officially becoming a Scion and working tirelessly with his comrades to deliver the world from the calamity known as the Final Days.

Following his long journey from archnemesis of dragons to their friend and brother, Estinien renamed his lance Nidhogg after his fallen foe. Though he is still a lone wolf at heart, he travels more often with others than before─such as to the isle of Thavnair, where he has forged a new friendship with Vrtra, another of the first brood.","　かつて竜騎士団を率いていた「蒼の竜騎士」にして、「屠龍」の異名で呼ばれたイシュガルド系エレゼン族の男性。

　クルザス東部高地で牧羊を営む家庭に生まれるが、12歳の時、故郷ファーンデールが邪竜「ニーズヘッグ」に襲われて壊滅。両親と弟を殺され、天涯孤独の身となる。そんな彼を養ったのが、時の「蒼の竜騎士」アルベリクだった。エスティニアンにとってアルベリクは、故郷を守れなかった男であると同時に、復讐の力となる槍術の師匠であり、第二の父親でもあるという複雑な関係である。

　そんな男の下で黙々と修行を続けた彼は、やがて神殿騎士団へと入隊。そこでもまた竜を狩ることだけに執着し続け、同じ部隊の仲間の名すら覚えない程であったという。だが、同じく隊内で浮いた存在であった若き神殿騎士アイメリクとは、年が近いこともあってか馬があい、竜との死闘を経て親友と呼べる間柄となる。その後、竜狩りの功績が認められて竜騎士団への入団を許された彼は、やがて仇たるニーズヘッグから引き抜かれたとされる秘宝「竜の眼」に認められ、その力を利用して戦う「蒼の竜騎士」の称号を得たのだった。

　莫大な魔力を有する「竜の眼」は強大な力を与えると同時に使い手の精神を蝕む、正に諸刃の剣である。エスティニアンが半ばニーズヘッグに魅入られながらも、どうにか正気を保てた背景に師と友の存在があったことは疑いの余地がない。加えて、皇都に来訪した光の戦士とアルフィノ、そして敵として出会ったイゼルの存在もまた、彼の人生に大きな影響を与えた。
　エスティニアンは彼らとともに、竜の根拠地たるドラヴァニア雲海へと向かったのだ。この旅で彼は聖竜フレースヴェルグから、竜詩戦争の発端となった真実、すなわち古のイシュガルド王トールダンによる詩竜ラタトスク謀殺の事実を知り、また仇として追い続けていたニーズヘッグの討伐を成し遂げる。これが竜詩戦争の終結とイシュガルドの変革に大きく寄与したことは周知のとおりである。

　この後も、エスティニアンは光の戦士たちに同行。蛮神を利用した強制教化による恒久平和の実現を目論むトールダン7世の追撃に協力したが、この戦いの果てに、ふたつのニーズヘッグの眼を手にしたことで肉体を乗っ取られ、「邪竜の影」と化してしまう。かくして祖国の敵となった彼であったが、旅の仲間たちと親友の尽力により、後に救われることとなる。

　その後、彼は祖国の共和制への移行を見届けると、兜を置いて出奔。これ以降は気ままな旅を続け、陰ながら光の戦士たちのアラミゴ攻めを支援するなどした。だが、タタルとクルルからの猛烈な勧誘に屈して帝都ガレマルドの調査に協力した後、正式に「暁の血盟」に加入。終末を巡る旅にも同行した。

　なお、彼は仇敵の血で濡れた竜槍を「魔槍ニーズヘッグ」と名付け、そのまま使い続けている。またサベネア島で出会った星竜ヴリトラとは、奇妙な友人関係を構築するなど、今なお七大天竜との縁が深いようだ。","","False","0x0000000E","",""

"","A relatively recent addition to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, G'raha Tia hails from Corvos in southern Ilsabard, where the Allagan Empire once flourished during the Third Astral Era. Although the Miqo'te were once forced to toil in obscurity for the glory of Allag, G'raha Tia's tribe, ever proud, devoted themselves to the study and preservation of arcane secrets. Thousands of years later, when Corvos was conquered by the Garleans and brought under the jurisdiction of the illustrious House Darnus, a young G'raha─heir to vast stores of Allagan knowledge and the last child born with the Allagan Eye, was given into the custody of the Students of Baldesion.

After acquiring Sharlayan citizenship and freedom from more mundane duties, G'raha concentrated on his education, earning his Archon's mark for his groundbreaking research into ancient arcane wisdom. Owing to these qualifications, G'raha Tia was tasked with the vital duty of investigating the Crystal Tower, the most fascinating and forbidding of the surviving relics of the Allagan Empire. It was during this expedition that he met with Rammbroes of the Sons of Saint Coinach, Cid Garlond of the Ironworks, and the Warrior of Light─an occasion which led to the formation of the fellowship known as NOAH.

With his newfound companions, he laid bare the secrets of ancient Allag, and learned from the awakened clones Unei and Doga that the eye he inherited was, in truth, the Royal Eye, the unmistakable mark of the Allagan imperial family. With it, he could control the Crystal Tower itself, per the wishes of Salina, the final princess of Allag, who had chosen to pass down this gift and place her trust in future generations.

Judging that mankind was not yet ready for the secrets of the Crystal Tower, G'raha Tia sealed himself within it, in the hope that he might awaken in an age when his fellow man had set aside their differences─when they might truly comprehend and wield the Allagan knowledge for the benefit of all.

Alas, when G'raha awoke from his slumber two hundred years later, the world had been ravaged by tragedy and death, for the Eighth Umbral Calamity had come to pass. Biggs─third of his name and eighteenth chairman of Garlond Ironworks─had cracked the tower's wards, seeking to harness the power within to develop a means of time travel, that they might forge a future in which the Calamity had never occurred. G'raha agreed to lend them his aid, and so it was that he and the Crystal Tower were transported into the past─not of their world, the Source, but of the reflection known as the First, where fate would once again see him reunited with the Warrior of Light.

The First, for its part, had suffered a calamity no less daunting than that of the Source. A Flood of Light had nearly extinguished all life, and what little remained was beset by horrors born of the phenomenon known as sin eaters. Unaged due to his symbiosis with the Crystal Tower, an ever-youthful G'raha Tia took the initiative in building the Crystarium─a city and bulwark of hope where he and his growing community would stand against these foes.

For a hundred years, the Crystal Exarch─as G'raha Tia had come to be known─laid the groundwork for the coming battle, for he had always known that he could not triumph without the Warrior of Light. When the time came, he summoned the champion and their allies─albeit accidentally─from the Source, assembling a formidable alliance to take up arms against the Lightwardens and reclaim the long-absent night sky.

The final step in G'raha Tia's plan would have seen him render up his own life for the preservation of the First and the Source. Blessedly, this sacrifice did not come to pass. Ultimately, the Warrior of Light and their brave companions succeeded in laying low the Ascians Emet-Selch and Elidibus, ending the threat of an Eighth Umbral Calamity and giving the First hope for a brighter tomorrow.

When the Scions at last returned to their own world, they did not do so alone. G'raha Tia had conceived a method in which his memories and essence in the First could be merged with his past self still sleeping within the Crystal Tower of the Source. The awoken G'raha Tia eagerly joined the ranks of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and proceeded to employ his ample knowledge of all things Allagan, as well as the leadership skills he honed as the Crystal Exarch, to provide invaluable guidance and support to his companions. In particular, his decisive actions in Thavnair during the Final Days ensured the survival of countless innocents.

After the de facto disbanding of the Scions, G'raha Tia joined Krile in helping to rebuild the Students of Baldesion. However, he has not yet shaken his wanderlust, and will not hesitate to seize any opportunity to embark upon a new journey with the Warrior of Light.","　「暁の血盟」に所属するミコッテ族の男性。

　以降はシャーレアン籍となり、同委員会で研究に没頭。アラグ文明の研究において賢人位を獲得するまでになる。

　そんな彼に、アラグの遺産であるクリスタルタワーの調査依頼が持ちかけられたのは必然だっただろう。そこで、英雄として頭角を現し始めていた光の戦士と出会い、聖コイナク財団のラムブルース、ガーロンド・アイアンワークスのシドらとともに、調査団「ノア」を結成。アラグ帝国崩壊にまつわる闇を暴くとともに、目覚めたクローンのドーガとウネから、自身の継承する魔眼が古くは「皇血の魔眼」と呼ばれアラグ皇族の証だったと聞く。
　それは、最後の皇女サリーナによって未来に託された希望、クリスタルタワーを制御しうる権限だったのだ。ドーガとウネから血を補われたグ・ラハ・ティアはその使命を自覚し、人々がアラグの遺産を正しく活用できるようになる日まで、塔とともに封印という眠りについたのだった。

　果たして、願いは聞き届けられたのだろうか。彼が次に目覚めたのは、約200年後……第八霊災の発生によって、世界はすっかり荒廃していた。塔の封印を解いたビッグスIII世たちの一味は、時間と次元の転移術によって「第八霊災が発生しない歴史」を確立しようと活動していた。光の戦士の英雄譚によって繋がった彼らの手で、グ・ラハ・ティアはクリスタルタワーごと、過去の「第一世界」に跳ぶこととなる。

　第一世界は、光属性の過剰な高まりによる災害「光の氾濫」によって滅びの危機に瀕していた。その属性の偏りがさらに進めば、原初世界で第八霊災が誘発されてしまう。彼は自身を塔の端末とすることで不老の身と魔力を得、塔のもとに避難してきた人々とともに「クリスタリウム」の都市を形成。「光の氾濫」が生んだ異形「罪喰い」との戦いを開始する。
　以降100年近くの時を「水晶公」として戦いに費やした彼は、「大罪喰い」を討伐するにあたって原初世界から「暁の血盟」の面々と光の戦士を召喚。いっときは自身の命と引き換えに世界を救おうとするものの、数奇な運命と仲間たちの尽力から、生きて役目を成し遂げるに至る。

　そんな彼が望んだのは、再びグ・ラハ・ティアとして、光の戦士とともに冒険に出ることだった。呼び寄せた仲間たちを原初世界へ返すという難題を乗り越え、彼自身もまた原初世界へと帰還。晴れて「暁の血盟」の一員となる。以降は持ち前のアラグの知識と、水晶公として培った経験で仲間たちをサポートしつつ、ひとりの只人として日々を謳歌している。

　数々の夢を追って来た彼だが、「暁の血盟」が表向きに解散してからは、古巣のバルデシオン委員会に戻り再建を手伝っている。あわよくば面白い冒険の種を見つけ、光の戦士とともに乗り出すことを、新たな夢として抱きながら。","","False","0x00000012","",""

"","Orphaned as a child and taken in by Galuf Baldesion, founder of the eponymous Students of Baldesion, Krile was blessed with power of the Echo─though in her early years it seemed to her more a curse. Uncommonly sensitive to the feelings of others, unwelcome thoughts flooded her mind, leading her to develop a guarded personality that many found off-putting. Seeing this, Galuf gave her a cat-eared hood, assuring her that her gift was not something to be bemoaned, and that it would one day prove a tremendous strength. Moved by her grandfather's words, Krile vowed to devote herself to her studies, that she might use her power to serve the greater good.

Displaying a remarkable aptitude in the mystic arts, Krile attended the Studium in Sharlayan, joining the Faculty of the Arcane and becoming highly skilled in healing and curing magicks. It was at this time that she made the acquaintance of Alphinaud and Alisaie Leveilleur, with whom she maintains a close friendship to this day. After graduation, she joined her grandfather's research organization, eventually coming to Eorzea to support the Scions of the Seventh Dawn as they rebuilt their operation following the bloody banquet in Ul'dah. She lent her impressive knowledge of the arcane to the search for the missing Minfilia.

Krile chose to remain in Eorzea for the foreseeable future, both out of a desire to support her friends, and for lack of a home to which she might return. Prior to her arrival, the Isle of Val was obliterated by a devastating spell akin to Ultima. While she herself was on the isle at the time, she was saved by the blessing of Light, and so she naturally fell in with the Scions. She soon became a full-fledged member, and thenceforth used her command of the Echo to serve her comrades on many an occasion.

Krile suffered a particularly harrowing experience when she was captured as a prisoner of war by the Garleans during the campaign to liberate Ala Mhigo. Her Echo made her a target, as the magitek engineer Aulus mal Asina sought to study the phenomenon and create an artificial variant. He succeeded in this endeavor, transforming Fordola rem Lupis and Zenos yae Galvus into beings he dubbed the Resonant. Krile was later rescued by the Scions, and after recovering from the ordeal resolved to repay the favor. Indeed, when her companions were forcefully summoned to the First and left in a comatose state, Krile took the lead in nursing the Scions back to health.

With the appearance of the Telophoroi and the looming threat of the Final Days, Krile returned to Sharlayan in hopes of gauging the true intentions of their governing body, the Forum, which to that point had stubbornly refused to approve any aid to Eorzea. Subsequently, she would use her influence as representative of the Students of Baldesion to arrange for her friends to visit Old Sharlayan.

Now that the Final Days have been averted and the Scions ostensibly disbanded, Krile has devoted herself to the restoration of the Students, recruiting the precious few survivors she has found, along with new talent, that together they might carry on her late grandfather's legacy and preserve their knowledge for future generations.","　「暁の血盟」に所属するララフェル族の女性。

　これに前後してバルデシオン委員会の本部施設があったバル島がアルテマ級の魔法攻撃によって消滅し、事実上、組織が瓦解していたこともあって、エオルゼア渡航後は「暁の血盟」と行動を共にしており、後に正式に加入。魔法的な知識と異能「超える力」を活かして、数々の脅威に立ち向かった。

　なお、アラミゴ解放の戦いに従軍した際には、帝国軍の虜囚となる経験をしている。「超える力」を有する彼女を捕らえ、そのエーテル波形を記録したことで、魔導技師アウルスは疑似的な超える力とも言うべき「超越者」技術を開発しており、フォルドラやゼノスが異能を得る要因となった。その後、光の戦士たちの手で救出された彼女は、休養を経て復帰。賢人たちが第一世界へと強制召喚され、昏睡状態に陥った際には、彼らの肉体を保全するために尽力した。
　また、テロフォロイの出現によって終末の危機が迫ると、エオルゼア諸国からの協力要請を拒むシャーレアンの真意を探るために本国へ帰還。後に「バルデシオン委員会」の代表代行としての立場を利用することで、暁の主要メンバーをオールド・シャーレアンに招く算段を付けるなどした。

　終末の危機が去り、「暁の血盟」が秘密結社としての有りように戻るべく対外的に解散を発表した後には、「バルデシオン委員会」再建に注力。同組織の代表代行として、数少ない生き残りや新たな加入者たちとともに、亡き義父ガラフの遺志を継ごうと努力を続けている。","","False","0x00000016","",""

"","Displaying prodigious aptitude for magic from a young age, Y'shtola—at the behest of the Sharlayan Forum—was sent to Master Matoya for tutelage at the tender age of seven. Resentful of having to mind a child instead of pursuing her own research, the revered Archon was a stern taskmaster, imposing upon her new student one harsh trial after the next. Y'shtola, for her part, did not shirk from these formidable tasks, eventually winning the approval of her mentor—who doubtless saw in the stubborn Miqo'te girl shades of her own self as a child. After ten years of training, Y'shtola emerged from Matoya's cave a woman grown, possessed of vast knowledge and skill in the arcane that easily earned her the title of Archon.

Striking out on her own, Y'shtola joined the Circle of Knowing, led by her mentor's colleague and friend Louisoix Leveilleur. Sailing to Eorzea, she assisted her friends in their efforts in Limsa Lominsa in the fateful days leading up to the Seventh Umbral Calamity. During that time, she won the trust of Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn, to whom she lent invaluable assistance in rebuilding the Eorzean Alliance, which had theretofore devolved into a shell of its former glory. After Louisoix gave his life on the fields of Carteneau, Y'shtola became one of the founding members of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, formed by the merger of her own Circle of Knowing with a like-minded organization, the Path of the Twelve.

Together with her new companions, she worked tirelessly to quell the threat of the primals and defend Eorzea from the invasion of Garlemald's XIVth Imperial Legion. When the Scions were caught up in the political coup in Ul'dah, it was Y'shtola's command of forbidden and ancient teleportation magicks that allowed her and Thancred to escape the clutches of the villainous Crystal Braves. Left to wander the Lifestream as a result of this, she was on the verge of being lost forever to the aetheric currents when she was rescued and called back to this world through the efforts of Kan-E-Senna and the Warrior of Light. Y'shtola awoke from her coma to find she had lost the physical ability of sight, gaining in its stead the power to see aether in the environment around her. This gift is a double-edged sword, however—for while it allows her to remain a formidable presence in battle, the strain it places on her mind and energies is often great.

Having recovered her strength, Y'shtola joined her fellow Scions in their exploits across Eorzea, traveling to Azys Lla to depose the mad Archbishop Thordan VII and bring the Dragonsong War to an end, then playing a key role in the liberation of Ala Mhigo.

Y'shtola once again suffered a harrowing experience when her soul was accidentally forcefully summoned to the First by the Crystal Exarch. Assuming the alias “Matoya” in honor of her mentor and concealing her true identity, she befriended the Night's Blessed, a group of Dark-worshipers who made their home in the depths of the Rak'tika Greatwood. It was around this time that Y'shtola came to make extensive use of destructive magicks to complement the healing and curing arts at which she had always excelled.

After the Scions succeeded in restoring the darkness to the Light-blighted First, they returned home to the Source, where Y'shtola would again play an invaluable role in averting the dark designs of the Telophoroi—in the end journeying with her friends to Ultima Thule to deliver their world from the Final Days.

Having long served the now-disbanded Scions with her boundless knowledge and puissant sorcery, Y'shtola now strives to find an answer to the universe's most fundamental question—seeking the truth of creation to honor the legacy of her mentor, Master Matoya.","　「暁の血盟」に所属するミコッテ族の女性。

　魔法の才が豊かだった彼女は、7歳の時に賢者と名高いマトーヤに弟子入りする。しかし、師匠にとって彼女は喜ぶべき存在ではなかった。賢人会から課せられた義務で、嫌々受け入れたに過ぎなかったのだ。マトーヤは厄介払いとばかりに、厳しい修行を幼い弟子に強いた。だが、生来の負けず嫌いであるヤ・シュトラは、大人でも音を上げる試練にも歯を食いしばって耐え続けたという。やがて頑固者の少女の中に、自分と似たところを見出したのか、マトーヤは「シュトラ」の存在を認めるようになっていく。10年後、マトーヤの洞窟を後にした彼女が、魔法学の分野での知識と功績から、賢人位を与えられたのも当然であろう。

　かくして独り立ちした彼女は、マトーヤの友人でもあったルイゾワ・ルヴェユール率いる「救世詩盟」に参加。第七霊災の到来が迫る中でエオルゼアに渡り、主にリムサ・ロミンサで活動してきた。その中で同都市の指導者、メルウィブから厚い信頼を得るに至り、形骸化していたエオルゼア都市軍事同盟の再立ち上げなどに貢献。カルテノーの戦いにおいてルイゾワ師が戦死した後には、「十二跡調査会」との合併によって誕生した新組織「暁の血盟」へと参加している。

　その後も暁の賢人たちとともに、蛮神問題や帝国軍第XIV軍団への対応などに奔走。ウルダハの政変に巻き込まれた際には、クリスタルブレイブの兵に囲まれたものの、禁術エンシェント・テレポを使用することでサンクレッド共々、強制転送を敢行して脱出。しばしの間、地脈を彷徨うことになったが、光の戦士や幻術皇カヌ・エ・センナの力によって引き上げられ、九死に一生を得ている。ただし、この経験の副作用として視力を喪失。エーテルによって周辺環境を視ることで、生活に支障がないどころか、戦闘すらこなしてみせているが、これは魔力の消耗が激しい諸刃の剣でもある。

　復帰後は、教皇トールダン7世を追うために魔大陸への遠征に同行。竜詩戦争の終結に貢献した後には、アラミゴ解放の戦いにも参加している。
　また、水晶公による強制召喚に巻き込まれる形で、魂のみの状態で第一世界に渡航。彼の地では、ラケティカ大森林に根を張っていた「夜の民」と協力関係を構築し、真の名を秘す彼らの文化に則って魔女「マトーヤ」を名乗るようになる。それまで治癒術を用いることが多かった彼女が、より適した戦い方として破壊の魔法を多用するようになったのも、この頃から。
第一世界に闇を取り戻した後、原初世界に帰還すると、引き続き「暁の血盟」の主要メンバーとして活躍。テロフォロイによる終末危機に際しても大いに奮戦し、天の果て「ウルティマ・トゥーレ」への旅にも同行した。

　深淵な知識と優れた魔法によって仲間を支えてきた彼女だが、その根底には、常に「世界の真実」を知ろうとする探究心があった。それが師マトーヤから受け継いだものであることは、親しき者であれば、誰もが知るところである。","","False","0x0000001A","",""

Tales of Hydaelyn's call and the singular power it was said to bestow─the Echo─ have been recorded throughout history. The nature of this power was not wholly understood, and it was often conflated with another of Her gifts, the “blessing of Light,” which ensured one's aether would remain uncorrupted by primal tempering. The chosen few also spoke of being summoned to the heart of the star where, according to their testaments, awaited a pure and towering crystal. It is likely that said testaments gave rise to the appellation “Mothercrystal,” as well as the usage of “Hydaelyn” to refer to the star itself, though the precise point at which these terms became commonplace remains unknown. While many sought further knowledge of Her nature─the Sharlayan Forum foremost among them─few ascertained Hydaelyn's true identity: a primal with an ancient, Venat, at Her core.

In a time before time, society was governed by the Convocation of Fourteen, upon which Venat held the seat of Azem. An indefatigable and insatiably curious individual, she tired of the academic approach to natural studies, and resolved instead to travel the star and seek its truths through firsthand experience─a journey that she continued even after she abdicated her position. One day, during a visit to Elpis, she chanced to meet with the Warrior of Light, who had come from the future with a warning of calamities to come. Thus did she learn of the Final Days that would befall Etheirys, and of this tragedy's ultimate cause: Meteion, bearer of myriad fallen worlds' despair.

To prevent the obliteration of all life, Venat embarked upon a quest that would span millennia. Offering up her own flesh and soul, she summoned and became Hydaelyn. She sundered Her people, who yearned for a past that could never be restored; the god Zodiark, manifestation of that ill-fated wish; and the star itself, which She loved so dearly, into fourteen pieces. The god of Darkness was gaoled within the sundered worlds' moons, and their people condemned to a fragile and imperfect existence forevermore. However, She knew that from their imperfection─their suffering─would arise the strength to face deepest despair.

So passionate was Her love for mankind, so unwavering Her faith in its potential, that Hydaelyn would never, in the eons that followed, waver in Her belief. Even as shard after shard fell to calamity and were rejoined with the Source, empowering Zodiark as it enervated Her in turn, She stayed the course, awaiting the day when man would prove himself worthy. When at last the time came, and the Scions of the Seventh Dawn triumphed over Her in a battle that burned through Her very soul, She faded away with a smile on her lips and peace in her heart.

Though the Warrior of Light and their comrades would go on to follow the path She had shown them, Hydaelyn was no more. Her love for Her children, however, is eternal.","　惑星「アーテリス」の運行を司るもの、すなわち「星の意志」と考えられていた存在。

　いにしえより、「超える力」と呼ばれる異能を持つ者が、彼女の呼び声を聞くという事象が報告されており、中には巨大なクリスタルがある空間に招かれたと語る者もいた。それらの証言によって、いつからか巨大なクリスタルは「マザークリスタル」と呼ばれるようになり、「ハイデリン」の名は星そのものの呼び名としても使われるようになったという。
　彼女に呼ばれた者は、ときに、「光の加護」と呼ばれる力を得た。これはエーテルの変質を防ぐものであり、蛮神の術による精神汚染などを受けなくなることが実証されている。

　ハイデリンの存在は長く人々に語り継がれ、ときにはシャーレアンのように具体的な研究に乗り出す者もいた。しかしその正体が、古代人「ヴェーネス」を核として創られた存在、いわば古き蛮神であるということを知る者は少ない。

　ヴェーネスは、古代世界の最高機関である「十四人委員会」で、「アゼム」の座を務めていた女性である。もともとは世界の成り立ちや法則について追究する学者だったというが、情熱に突き動かされ、世界を肌で感じるために旅を始めた。アゼムとしての任期中はもちろん、座を後任に譲ったあとも、精力的に各地を飛び回っていたようだ。
　やがて彼女は「エルピス」の地で、時代を遡ってきた光の戦士と出会う。そして知った、先行く星々の絶望……アーテリス外の生命は、生きるという行為をすでに見限っていたのだ。それを受け取ってしまったメーティオンが、遥か天から「終末の災厄」を引き起こしていると知ったことで、ヴェーネスの長くつらい戦いがはじまった。

　彼女はハイデリンとなり、ゾディアークにすがって過去への回帰を望む人々を、世界もろとも十四に分断した。分かたれたゾディアークはそれぞれの世界の月に封じられ、人もまた、仮初の全能を失った。絶望なき世界が在りえないのであれば、絶望とともに歩む強さを得なければならない……それこそが、星を愛し、人を愛し、その可能性を信じたヴェーネスの答えだったのだ。

　霊災が起き、世界が統合されるたびに、ゾディアークは力を取り戻していく。どうにか抑え込むものの、ハイデリンの力は摩耗していく一方……。
　しかし、人はついに、自らの足で彼女のもとに辿りつく。その強さと未来を見定める、最後の試練として立ちはだかった彼女は、魂までも振り絞って光の戦士たちと死闘を繰り広げたのだった。

In order to weaken and imprison Zodiark, Hydaelyn mustered Her strength and sundered the very fabric of reality, causing the world to be split into fourteen shards, akin to identical, diluted images. Being reflections, the geographical features of these worlds are naturally similar, akin to observing the original through a looking glass. But over the course of millennia, the peoples of each have lived disparate lives and histories, and some variance has manifested in the environment itself as well. Since the reflections were birthed forth, seven have been lost, sacrificed in the Ascians' quest to restore the ancient world.

Curiously, while the reflections are displaced from each other, the boundaries between them are not uniform; certain worlds, such as the First and the Thirteenth, are more readily accessible from the Source, while others are not. One theory posits that the worlds exist within pockets of reality that are arranged in a pattern not unlike the numbers on a clockface, and that it is easier to travel to an adjacent reflection.","　我々が暮らす「原初世界」と異なる次元に並立する十三の世界のこと。

　このとき分かたれた十三の世界は、一般に「第一世界～第十三世界」と呼ばれるのだが、地形その他は鏡に映したかのように似通っていたようだ。「鏡像世界」と名付けられたのは、それゆえである。
　ただし、分割後の一万二千年の間、異なる歴史を歩んだため、各世界には異なる文明が花開いており、環境にも差が生じているという。またアシエンが原初世界への統合を進めたことで、既に計7つの鏡像世界が消え去っている。

　なお、すべての世界がズレた次元の上に存在しているのだが、「次元の狭間」を挟んだ世界の「繋がりやすさ」には差があるとも言われている。原初世界を起点に、時計盤の上に並ぶ数字のように世界が並んでいる姿を想像してほしい。原初世界に隣接する第一世界と第十三世界は、世界を隔てる壁が薄く、第七世界や第八世界は厚い壁に挟まれているのだ。","","False","0x00000021","",""

"","Approximately six millennia ago, when the world still languished in the aftermath of the Third Umbral Calamity, there arose a man who led an army of mages on a campaign of conquest. Xande would go on to found the storied Allagan Empire, as well as marry the secrets of magic and wisdom of science to create aetherochemistry. Through advances in this miraculous field, he expanded his dominion to encompass the continents of Aldenard, Ilsabard, and Othard.

However, generations of peace and prosperity gave rise to decadence, and a thousand years after the nation's birth, progress all but ground to a halt. The people grew complacent, abandoning learning and drowning themselves in leisure, and society stagnated. None lamented this deplorable state of affairs more than a technologist named Amon.

Desiring to restore his nation to its former glory, Amon brought Emperor Xande back from the grave. Under the founding father's leadership, the empire was given renewed purpose in world domination. In order to bolster the might of his armies, Xande entered into a pact with the Cloud of Darkness, a sovereign among voidsent, and granted their kind passage to the world of men in return for their aid in assuring the supremacy of his reign.

The Crystal Tower played a key role in all of these events. Built to harness the power of the sun, it provided the sprawling empire with energy during its heyday. When the empire fell into decline, Amon used that selfsame energy to resurrect Xande, and Xande in turn used it to open a gate to the void.

Eventually, the emperor resolved to welcome the Cloud of Darkness herself into our world, a feat which would require a voidgate of heretofore unseen proportions. To this end, he commanded that the eikon Bahamut, captured in Meracydia, be encapsulated within a massive iron sphere. The sphere was launched into the heavens and set into motion alongside the moon, where it utilized the wyrm's affinity to fire-aspected aether to accumulate solar energy in a more concentrated form. Yet while the tower had been fortified to channel the increased flow, the land upon which it had been built could not withstand the immense forces. The Crystal Tower's collapse triggered a series of earthquakes which shook the entire realm, bringing about the Fourth Umbral Calamity and consigning the Allagan Empire to oblivion.

For five millennia the Crystal Tower lay buried and forgotten, until the violence of the Seventh Umbral Era coaxed it from its resting place. Awakened from his long slumber, Emperor Xande once more sought to fulfill his nihilistic ambitions, but he would be thwarted by the stout souls of the fellowship of NOAH and their newfound comrades from the distant past.","　約六千年の昔、まだ第三霊災の余韻が残るエオルゼアに、魔道士の軍勢を率いて覇を唱えた男がいた。男の名は「ザンデ」、そして彼が樹立した国家こそ、歴史に名高い「アラグ帝国」である。アラグ帝国は魔法と科学を融合させた「魔科学」を確立し、大いに発展。エオルゼアのみならず、現在の北州イルサバード大陸や、東州オサード小大陸にまで版図を広げた。
　しかし、長く続いた平和と栄華は、やがて人心を退廃へと誘うこととなる。建国から千年が経つころには発展も頭打ちになり、人々は快楽と安寧を貪るようになっていた。その状況を打破するために立ち上がったのが、魔科学者「アモン」だ。

　彼は研究を重ね、ついに始皇帝ザンデを復活させた。ザンデは世界統一に乗り出し、その野望のもとでアラグ帝国はにわかに活気を取り戻したのだ。戦の中でザンデが活用した力のひとつに、異界「ヴォイド」から招いた妖異の軍勢がある。ザンデは魔王級の妖異「暗闇の雲」と血の契約を交わし、妖異たちが行き来するためのゲートを開く代わりに、軍勢の貸与と皇族の繁栄を約束させたのだ。

　そんなアラグ史に沿って、太陽の力を集積するために建造された「クリスタルタワー」は、帝国のエネルギー供給を支え続けてきた。繁栄の時代には、国を潤す公益施設として。衰退期には、ザンデ復活に必要な力を集めるために。そして彼の復活後は、ヴォイドゲートを開く力を賄ったのだ。
　ザンデはやがて、「暗闇の雲」本体を原初世界に招き入れる計画を立てる。南方遠征の際に捕らえた龍神「バハムート」を人工衛星「ダラガブ」に封じて天に昇らせ、フレアを操るその力で太陽の力をさらに集めようとしたのだ。これが、アラグ帝国に終焉をもたらした。ダラガブから注いだ莫大な力に、クリスタルタワーを支える地盤が耐えきれず、地殻が崩壊……第四霊災とされる大地震を引き起こした。塔自体もまた地中へと沈み、歴史から姿を消したのだった。

　それを再び地上に引き上げたのは、第七霊災の衝撃だった。長い時を経てもう一度動き出したザンデらの野望は、調査団「ノア」の活躍と、アラグの時代から受け継がれた希望によって食い止められたのだった。","","False","0x00000024","",""

"","An avid reader since he was old enough to hold a tome, Urianger spent his youth engrossed in books of prophecy. Eastern, Western, modern, historical─the young Elezen devoured all manner of sources concerning his favorite subject, though in so doing acquired an erudite vocabulary and poetic mannerisms that alienated his peers. His steadfast studiousness─along with the encouragement of his childhood friend, Moenbryda─did, however, enable him to enter the Studium under the auspices of the foremost authority on prophecy, Archon Louisoix. Indeed, it is thought that Urianger elected to join the Circle of Knowing to learn the truth of Mezaya Thousand Eyes's <var 1A 02 /var>Divine Chronicles<var 1A 01 /var>, a work that hinted at the coming of the Seventh Umbral Calamity.

In the moons preceding said Calamity, Urianger sought to share his knowledge with the people of Eorzea, but his doomsaying only served to earn him an unflattering reputation. After the prophecies came to pass, and his beloved mentor was lost in the fires of Cartenau, he and the other remnants of the Circle of Knowing joined with the Path of the Twelve to form the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. Thenceforth, Urianger became a fixture in the halls of the Waking Sands.

Although his profound knowledge of history has ever been a boon to the Scions, Urianger's verbose explanations and dry manner have given rise to interpersonal tensions. Of particular note are the events following Moenbryda's death during the confrontation with the Ascian Nabriales, when a grieving and guilt-stricken Urianger took it upon himself to treat with Elidibus in secret. In so doing, he learned long-lost secrets, which he used to sabotage the Ascian's plot to manipulate the Warriors of Darkness. While he had the best of intentions, the decisions he made without the input of his allies─such as orchestrating the journey of Minfilia, the Word of the Mother, to the First─and their consequences would long weigh heavy on his heart.

To compound his turmoil, Urianger was pressured into deceiving his allies once more when the Crystal Exarch summoned him to the First. After divulging his true identity as G'raha Tia, the Exarch implored him to pretend that his own knowledge of future tragedies was a vision Urianger had witnessed when passing between worlds. Believing this fiction was essential for the success of the Exarch's plan to prevent the Eighth Umbral Calamity through his personal sacrifice, Urianger reluctantly agreed and retreated to Il Mheg. However, when the truth was finally laid bare, the Warrior of Light─then the Warrior of Darkness─refused to allow the Exarch to trade his life for the star's safety, rendering the deception meaningless.

Urianger, overcome with regret, resolved to be more forthright and emotionally open with his comrades from that day forward. Upon returning to the Source and being confronted with the reality of the Final Days, he played a key role in facilitating cooperation between the people of Etheirys and the moon-dwelling Loporrits. But it was not until a tearful reunion with Moenbryda's parents, who welcomed him as they would a son, that he began to feel as though he was growing into the man he wanted to be. Ultimately, it was the relationships Urianger cultivated that would see the ship <var 1A 02 /var>Ragnarok<var 1A 01 /var> take to the stars, and hope restored to the star.","　「暁の血盟」に所属するエレゼン族の男性。

　幼少期から書を好み、特に興味を抱いた預言詩については、真贋を問わず古今東西ありとあらゆる詩を読みあさってきた。そのためか少年の頃から難解な詩的表現で会話するようになってしまい、同年代の者たちからは浮いた存在だったという。だが、自身のたゆまぬ努力と、幼なじみムーンブリダの支えもあって、難関シャーレアン魔法大学に入学。さらには預言詩研究の権威である賢人ルイゾワに弟子入りすることもできた。師が結成した「救世詩盟」に参加したのも、第七霊災の到来を暗示した「メザヤの預言」の記述を確かめたいとの想いが、強く影響してのことだったという。

　第七霊災の直前のこと、来たるべき災厄を警告するためにエオルゼアに渡航。人々に備えを呼びかけたが、独特の語り口から不審者として噂されたことも。敬愛するルイゾワの死後は、他の賢人と同様に「暁の血盟」へ参加。ザナラーンにおける同組織の拠点「砂の家」の執務長を務めた。

　専門である預言詩を含む古の知識に詳しく、その博学さは「暁の血盟」の活動を下支えした。しかし、その一方で自らの感情よりも、事実関係や学術的な正確性に重きをおいた発言を重ねたことで、かえって聞く者に誤解を与えることもあった。特にムーンブリダがアシエン・ナプリアレスとの戦いで死した後には、生来の責任感の強さも相まって、その傾向に拍車がかかった。結果、アシエン・エリディブスの接触を受けた際には、世界の真実に迫る情報を得るため、そして闇の戦士たちから伝え聞いた第一世界の危機を回避するため、独断で行動してしまう。彼の行いは決して裏切りではなかったが、星の代弁者となっていた「暁の血盟」の盟主ミンフィリアを第一世界に送るなど、重大な決定を独りで下しており、ウリエンジェ自身も強い負い目を感じることとなってしまう。

　また水晶公による強制召喚に巻き込まれる形で、第一世界へと渡った後も、最善の道を選ぼうとするがゆえの苦悩は続いた。水晶公から、公自身の犠牲を前提とした救済策への協力を求められ、受け入れたことは、まさにその好例であろう。ウリエンジェはこの盟約に従い、水晶公から伝え聞いた「第八霊災後の未来」に関わる情報を、自らが次元の狭間で垣間見たヴィジョンであると偽って伝えることで、仲間たちの活動方針に影響を与えている。その後、妖精郷イル・メグでの隠遁生活を経てから、仲間たちと合流し活動を本格化。だが、英雄は水晶公の策を否定し、彼の死を許さなかった。その姿に胸打たれたウリエンジェは、以後、仲間に己の想いを秘してきたことを悔い、新たな生き方を模索しはじめる。

　このような変化は、原初世界への帰還後に訪れた終末危機に際しても好影響を与えた。月の民たるレポリットとの信頼関係の構築、そしてムーンブリダの両親との再会。そのいずれもが、魔導船「ラグナロク」の完成へと繋がり、やがては絶望に抗う力ともなったのだった。","","False","0x00000028","",""

"","This kind-hearted dragon is one of the seven sired by Midgardsormr in a time before mankind's memory. The talismans made from his green-black scales are treasured by those Scions and Alliance members fortunate enough to possess them, as they provide protection against soul-warping aether.

Vrtra took up residence on the cliffs of Thavnair long before the founding of Radz-at-Han. The Matanga came next to the isle, but they knew well enough to let sleeping dragons lie. They were followed by the Au Ra, who despite cultural differences maintained cordial relations with their new neighbors. It was not until the coming of Hyuran colonizers that Thavnair knew war─and it was Vrtra who emerged to quell it ere its flames consumed the land. The various tribes welcomed his intervention, yet he remained convinced that however grateful they may be, they would never be content to let a dragon lord over them─and there would never be lasting peace. And so he asked Alzadaal of the Au Ra to lead the people in public as Vrtra himself withdrew into the shadows...whence he would provide guidance to the satrap and his successors. Thus was the isle united under the banner of Radz-at-Han.

As Alzadaal and his descendants ruled the diverse Radz-at-Han for centuries, behind the scenes, Vrtra was no less devoted to her people. In fact, he was closer to them than they knew, for he oft embedded one of his eyes in alchemical simulacra of men that he might walk among them. Many of these simulacra would be sent abroad as representatives of the satrap at one point or another, there to be made permanent ambassadors─providing a convenient excuse for the wyrm to switch vessels.

When the Final Days came to his beloved home, twisting his people into beasts for whom death was a mercy, Vrtra realized that things could not continue as before. Loyal Ahewann, the erstwhile satrap, had fallen protecting the citizens, and to honor his final wish, Vrtra would have to become satrap in name as well as deed. With a little encouragement from Estinien, he at last revealed himself to the Hannish people as their longtime protector.

In the wake of an apocalypse averted, Thavnair began to rebuild under Vrtra's auspices. His simulacrum is frequently spotted out and about in Radz-at-Han, and while the public is no longer fooled by his diminutive guise, he is yet resolved to traverse the city as a man might, to better understand their plight and ensure that no quarter is left wanting.","　「ミドガルズオルム」の仔にして、「七大天竜」の一翼。心優しき巨大な竜である。彼を覆う深緑の鱗から作られた護符「護魂の霊鱗」は、精神汚染を引き起こすエーテル放射を打ち消すものとして、「暁の血盟」および各国に重宝されている。

　そこに至る経歴を紐解こう。現在ラザハンの都があるサベネア島の大岩には、古くから彼ヴリトラが棲んでいた。そのうちにマタンガ族の祖先が島にやってきて住み着いたものの、彼らは偉大なる竜のねぐらを決して侵さなかった。次にやって来たアウラ族もそれに倣い、人と竜の緩やかな関係が築かれていったのだ。
　変化が訪れたのは、大陸からヒューラン族が攻め入ってきたときのこと。ヴリトラ自らが進み出て、戦いを収めたのだ。人々は深く感謝し、彼のもとに和平の取り決めをした。かくしてヴリトラはより深く人と関わることになったのだが、強大な竜の力がかえって火種となりかねないと考えた彼は、表舞台に立つことを固辞。アウラ族の族長アルザダールに表向きの代表として立つことを願い出る。こうして、種族と文化が入り混じった多彩なる国「ラザハン」の原型ができあがったのだ。

　表向きの太守一族と協力しながら、ヴリトラはラザハンの発展を見守り、民を慈しんできた。ときにはラザハン式錬金術の粋を集めた魔法人形に、強い魔力を帯びた自身の眼をはめこみ、分身を作成。正体を隠して市井に紛れ込んでいたようだ。分身の多くは「太守の付き人」という肩書になっており、やがては外交官になって異国へ赴任……もとい、別の人形に入れ替えられるのである。
　光の戦士たちがサベネア島を初めて訪れた際にも、彼は「ヴァルシャン」と名乗るアウラ族の子どもに扮していた。七大天竜の中でも末弟であると語る彼だからこそ為せる技なのか、人々にしっかり弟分として可愛がられていたようだ。

　そんな彼の愛するサベネア島で、「終末の災厄」が発生。負の感情を抱いた民が次々と獣へ転じ、未曽有の惨劇へと発展してしまう。長年ヴリトラの右腕を務めてきた太守「アヒワーン」さえも、混乱の最中で民を護り落命。その最後の願いを受け、エスティニアンに背を押されたヴリトラは、真の太守として民の前に立つことになったのだった。

　終末が去った今、ラザハンはヴリトラのもとで再建への道を歩み始めたようだ。名実ともに太守として知れ渡った彼だが、今でも人形を使って街へ赴いている。素性を隠すためではなく、竜の身では降り立てない入り組んだ街の隅々まで、しっかりと眼に映すために。","","False","0x0000002C","",""

"","This vital energy is essential to life as we know it.

For a being to be classified as “living,” it requires both a soul and physical vitality, each of which is composed of aether. Scholars posit that this aether can and must be restored throughout life via the consumption and digestion of sustenance─whether this is the primary factor in the body's need for nourishment is unclear, but what we do know is that the critical depletion of aether will result in physical or spiritual death.

Aether manifests in many ways aside from the aforementioned two, including magical phenomena both natural and of man's design. Most importantly, it flows imperceptibly throughout the world, forming the great Lifestream to which all life one day returns, as well as the smaller aether currents that drive the winds and carry the winged aloft. Without aether's blessings, our star would be a barren and desolate hell.

Upon death, a being's aether disperses, and passes from the mundane physical world into the aetherial realm. However, where many lives are lost suddenly due to violence or calamity, or the flow of the Lifestream itself is disrupted, the aether may instead coalesce upon the physical plane, forming the crystals with which our star is replete.","　すべての命の源とされる生命エネルギーのこと。

　生物の「生命力」や「魂」は、すべてエーテルによって構成されており、これが失われることで死を迎えることになる。ある学説によれば、生物が食事を摂る際には、栄養に加えてエーテルも摂取しているのだという。また、生物が宿すエーテルは、しばしば「魔力」とも呼ばれ、魔法的な現象の原動力としても用いられている。

　このようにエーテルは、生命活動にとって非常に重要な要素であるが、生物のみならず星そのものにも流れていることを忘れてはならない。大地を流れるエーテルの奔流「地脈」や、風とともに大気中を巡る「風脈」……これらが枯渇すれば、その地域は生物が暮らすことのできない死の大地になってしまうという。

　ちなみに生物が死した場合、その生命力や魂を構成していたエーテルは霧散し、我々が暮らす「物質界」と折り重なるように存在する「エーテル界」へと還っていく。一方で、激しい戦いや災害で瞬間的に大量の生命が失われたり、地脈が傷つけられたりした場合などには、エーテル界への還元が間に合わず、結晶化して物質界に残留する場合がある。これが一般に「クリスタル」と呼ばれている物質である。","","False","0x00000032","",""

This council, formed of ninety-nine elected representatives, dictates Sharlayan's course for matters great and small, be they minor regulations or national policy. Indeed, it was by the Forum's decree that, in response to the imperial invasion of Ala Mhigo, the Sharlayan colony in the Dravanian hinterlands was abandoned nearly overnight─an event referred to by many as simply “the exodus.”

In addition to his political power, Fourchenault also wields authority as the patriarch of the Leveilleurs, one of Sharlayan's oldest families. Its lineage can be traced back to the nation's founders who arrived aboard <var 1A 02 /var>Nyunkrepf's Hope<var 1A 01 /var> during the Sixth Umbral Calamity. Thus does the family keep Nyunkrepf's words as its creed. “Renounce the ways of war, and pursue enlightenment through knowledge and reason”─so spoke Sharlayan's first leader, and so too does Fourchenault Leveilleur.

Until recently, Fourchenault was driven to fulfill a singular purpose─one which the Forum had pursued in secret for two hundred and seventy years. Having learned of the Final Days through an unexpected communion with Hydaelyn in the aetherial sea, Sharlayan's elite set to work developing a ship by which to ferry their people─and their hard-won stores of knowledge─to the moon, thence to search for a new home among the stars.

Fourchenault's dedication to this plan grew more fervent after his wife Ameliance gave birth to their two children, Alphinaud and Alisaie. Desperate to ensure the twins escaped the coming apocalypse, he threw himself into his work with a determination bordering on obsession. The death of his own father, Archon Louisoix, during the Seventh Umbral Calamity only served to deepen his resolve.

As the Final Days drew closer, Fourchenault was consumed by fear for his children's safety and disapproval of their continued association with the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. He vowed to get them aboard Sharlayan's ship by any means necessary, even should it cost him what remained of their already strained relationship. However, when the twins accomplished the impossible by optimizing the ship's aetherburner, he came to understand that their conviction would not be denied─nor should it. Unburdening his heart, he at last reconciled with his family and embraced the monumental responsibility of saving the star.

　また、彼の属する哲学者議会は、長年にわたりある秘密を抱えてきた。遡ることおよそ270年前、星海探索中に邂逅した「ハイデリン」から、やがて来たる「終末の災厄」について伝えられたのだ。以来、哲学者議会は星外脱出計画を密かに推し進め、船としての機能を兼ね備える「月」へ、人々と収集した知識を運び出せるように準備をしてきた。フルシュノも、議員となった際に、その事実を知ったようだ。

　やがて、彼とアメリアンスの間にアルフィノとアリゼーが生まれる。フルシュノは子どもたちの未来のために、何としてでも終末の危機を回避することを固く決意。以来、議員としての仕事に没頭してきた。偉大なる父ルイゾワがエオルゼアに渡り、第七霊災を止めるために命を散らしたことも、その覚悟を頑なにした要因だろう。

As recently as a few decades ago, the six city-states of Eorzea coexisted in an age of relative stability. Alas, this peace was shattered in the year 1557 of the Sixth Astral Era, when the Garlean Empire embarked upon a campaign of Eorzean conquest.

Joining hands in common cause, they eventually succeeded in defeating the imperial invaders.

With all the elements accounted for, many scholars convinced themselves that there could not be another calamity─that the Sixth Astral Era would last indefinitely.

"","Eldest son of Varis zos Galvus, second Emperor of Garlemald, Zenos yae Galvus was groomed from birth to succeed his father. However, history would come to know him by another name: Zenos viator Galvus, kinslayer and outcast, whose misdeeds threw the Empire into a turmoil from which it would not escape.

Blessed with martial and intellectual gifts, Zenos ever stood apart from his peers. He was raised among the sons and daughters of nobility in the hopes that he might find companions to advise him in his future role, but none proved his equal. Though the crown prince scorned the naivety of children and deemed his elders unworthy of respect, he eventually found joy in hunting─in the primal desperation of the beasts who fought violently to survive. Zenos savored pitting his strength against theirs, and even after he became a military leader, this remained his sole pleasure.

It was after Zenos was appointed imperial viceroy of the provinces of Doma and Ala Mhigo that he would encounter prey of a different stripe: the Warrior of Light. Aided by the Eorzean champion and <var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var> allies, a band of rebels grew bold enough to draw the crown prince's attention, leading to their first altercation at Rhalgr's Reach. Alas, the Warrior of Light was soundly defeated that day. While a subsequent clash in Doma resulted in a similar outcome, Zenos grew more fascinated with the beast he dubbed “the champion of the savages,” electing to spare <var 08 E905 ((her)) ((him)) /var> a second time in the hopes <var 08 E905 ((she)) ((he)) /var> might grow into an even greater challenge.

In time, the Warrior of Light and <var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var> allies led an army to Ala Mhigo, and with <var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var> comrades engaged Zenos a third time within the Royal Palace. In that battle, the legatus realized that this was his first and only rival, and after luring <var 08 E905 ((her)) ((him)) /var> to the gardens atop the palace, Zenos used his artificial Echo to become one with the captive primal, Shinryu. For the fourth time he fought his prey, but on this occasion the Warrior of Light emerged triumphant. Having experienced a transcendental joy beyond any he had ever known, Zenos took his own life, unwilling to live outside that fleeting moment.

Yet in embracing his stolen power, Zenos had rewritten his fate. His essence did not return to the Lifestream, but instead possessed the body of another. In a cycle akin to that of the immortal Ascians, the erstwhile prince leaped from vessel to vessel, until he found one with which he could return home to Garlemald. There he was reunited with his original form, which had been occupied for a time by the Ascian Elidibus, and was thus resurrected body and soul.

His first act following his return was to murder his own father. This was not out of malice, but jealousy─Emperor Varis had set his sights on the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, and Zenos was loath to share his quarry with another. For the returned prince, who had known the exultation of a warrior's death, the purpose of this new life was clear: to confront the only soul he would deign to call friend, and reclaim the bliss he had known only once before.

As Garlemald teetered on the verge of collapse, Zenos was approached by the Ascian Fandaniel, who laid bare the truth of the star. Together the two formed the Telophoroi, who schemed to usher in the Final Days. They sowed discord across the realm, channeling aether from the Lifestream into the Tower of Babil, that Zodiark Himself might be liberated from His lunar prison. In this they did succeed─but before Zenos could seize control of the primal and battle the Warrior of Light, he was betrayed by Fandaniel, whose subsequent death at the hero's hand set in motion the Final Days. Zenos was still desperate for his long-desired rematch, but understood that the Warrior of Light was too distracted by the fate of the star to accept his challenge. And so, in disappointment he quit the field and vanished from the world's stage.

Zenos spent much of his self-imposed exile contemplating how he might obtain his heart's desire, but his answer proved simple. He would aid the Warrior of Light in <var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var> struggle, and to that end he assumed the form of the dragon once more and flew to the edge of the universe. With Zenos's aid the threat to all life was laid low, and when the dust had settled, the Warrior of Light at last granted his wish.

"","One of the sundered Ascians, Fandaniel first appeared before the Warrior of Light in the body of the late Asahi sas Brutus. Like those of his brethren, his name is in fact a title─one of the exalted offices of the Convocation of Fourteen, the collective that guided mankind in ancient times.

During the first Final Days, the seat was held by a man named Hermes, who prior to his induction served as chief overseer of Elpis, the testing ground of creation, and was an authority on flying life-forms as well as the celestial sphere. In the course of his work, however, Hermes came to question mankind's single-minded pursuit of perfection, prompting him to create Meteion and her sisters to seek the meaning of life in the distant stars. Alas, an accident caused them all to perish before they could fulfill their purpose...or so it was believed.

In truth, his creations found naught but despair, and concluded that salvation lay only in death. Furthermore, Meteion declared that she herself would usher in their demise. In a moment of madness, Hermes allowed her to pursue her designs, and erased the memories of those who knew what awaited─his own included─that mankind might be put to the proof and prove themselves capable of change and thus worthy of survival.

Ignorant of his deeds, Hermes went on to oppose the Final Days with all his being, as he himself had intended. His knowledge proved instrumental in forestalling the Final Days, and the formulation of the plan to sacrifice half their number to manifest the mighty Zodiark. This first primal served to shield the star from Meteion's song of oblivion, but would later be sundered into fourteen parts alongside all creation by His counterpart, Hydaelyn.

Ironically, in forcibly erasing his memories, Hermes engraved them deeper upon his soul. In the millennia that followed, the cycle of death and rebirth would lead him to recall the forgotten truth: that the architect of the apocalypse abided at the edge of the universe.

One of the incarnations who inherited a shard of Hermes's tormented soul was a man named Amon, a brilliant technologist who rose to prominence in the Allagan Empire just as it was falling into decline. A victim of its prosperity, the empire had grown stagnant; the people delighted in debauchery, and science was no more than a means to amuse the decadent masses. Lamenting this state of affairs, Amon resolved to resurrect the founding father, Emperor Xande, that he might restore the empire to its former glory. And though he succeeded in his unholy endeavor, the emperor, having once experienced death, had been forever changed by the knowledge. Seeking to return all to nothingness, he set in motion events that would lead to the empire's undoing. But before Allag was consigned to oblivion, the Ascians, wishing to make use of Amon's singular talents, called him to serve as the new Fandaniel.

In receiving of the Ascian mantle, Fandaniel regained the missing pieces of his past and recalled the truth of the Final Days in its entirety. After the three unsundered Ascians met their ends, he forged an alliance with Zenos in order to take control of Zodiark. His heart was a maelstrom of righteous anger and all-consuming despair, twisted further by the remnants of the dreams that had haunted him as Amon─of an ancient world rent asunder by a calamity well deserved.

Ultimately, he did not bear witness to the conclusion of the tale he had written.

　当時の人の価値観に疑問を抱いた彼は「メーティオン」を創造し、彼方の星々に命の意味を問いかけた。残念ながらその答えが返ってくる前にメーティオンは消滅……と記録されているが、真相は異なる。メーティオンは星々から、生とは絶望であり、終わりこそが安らぎであるという答えを持ち帰っていたのだ。過去へ渡っていた光の戦士の証言からも、彼女が終末を引き起こすであろうことは明白だった。しかしヘルメスはメーティオンを逃がしたばかりか、自らを含め未来を知った人々の記憶を消し去ったのだ。

　未来を知るからではなく、ただこの星に生きるひとりの人として、ヘルメスは終末に抗った。ゾディアークによる天脈の補強という手法も、彼の研究から導き出されたものだという。その存在は最終的に、世界ともどもハイデリンによって分割されて終わりを迎えた。
　それから長きにわたり生と死を繰り返す中で、魂に刻まれた記憶……かつてヘルメスが強引に消し去った、終末の要因が宇宙に現存しているという真実が浮かび上がってきたのだ。

　そんな魂を引き継ぎ、原初世界に興ったアラグ帝国に生まれたのが「アモン」である。稀代の魔科学者であった彼は、繁栄によって熟れすぎた価値観、たとえば美化される死や、退屈しのぎのために技術や生命が浪費されることを嫌悪した。そこで始皇帝「ザンデ」の復活によって母国に進歩と活力を取り戻さんとしたのだ。その試みは成功したかのように思われたが、一度死を経験したザンデが「すべては無に還る」という思想に囚われていたことで、アラグ帝国は破滅への道を辿ることになる。崩壊の直前、アモンの才知を惜しんだアシエンたちが働きかけたことによって、彼は新たなファダニエルとなったのだった。

　アシエンとして授けられた知識と、浮かび上がった記憶の断片が結びついたとき、彼は終末の正体を知る。オリジナルたちが相次いで亡くなったのを機に、ファダニエルはゼノスと接触してゾディアークを手中に収めようと動き出した。その胸の内にあったのは、連綿と積み重ねられてきた人への怒りと失望。あるいはアモンの見た夢の名残、消し去れなかった忠義心だったのかもしれない。
　ゾディアークとして死に、魂さえも星海の奥深く引きずり込まれた彼は知らない。光の戦士たちが、己の生前積み上げた成果を用いて、青い鳥へと辿りついたことを。","","False","0x00000044","",""

"","Throughout Eorzean history, whether it be in folklore or myth, there has been scattered mention of dark-robed figures known variously as “Ascians” or “Paragons.” With their twisted words, they would incite strife between peoples, or indeed, entire nations─often escalating hostilities by instructing the beleaguered inhabitants in the rituals of primal summoning.

While this portrayal was not inaccurate, it was not the entire story. In the course of their efforts to counter the machinations of the Ascians, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn came to understand the true nature of their enemy. They learned that the cabal was comprised of thirteen prominent individuals: three “unsundered” survivors of the Convocation of Fourteen, the council which had orchestrated the summoning of Zodiark in antiquity; and ten “sundered” souls─fragments of members restored to their former offices. They were known as Loghrif, Mitron, Emet-Selch, Pashtarot, Fandaniel, Altima, Halmarut, Nabriales, Igeyorhm, Deudalaphon, Emmerololth, Lahabrea, and Elidibus. These positions served as both name and title, for should an Ascian fall, another bearing a shard of the same soul would be found and raised to the vacant seat.

The Ascians' ultimate purpose was nothing less than the restoration of their dark god, Zodiark, and the resurrection of their ancient brethren. Such miracles demanded they sow chaos in both the Source and its reflections, that they might cultivate the conditions for cataclysmic Rejoinings. Only then would Zodiark be freed of His chains, and the souls of the modern age be worthy of offering up in sacrifice.","　数々の伝承や神話、そして歴史書の中に「天使い」、あるいは「アシエン」と呼ばれる存在についての記述が散見される。総じて「黒の法衣」をまとう姿で現れ、言葉巧みに種族や国家の対立を煽り、望みを叶える手段と称して、蛮神の召喚法を含むさまざまな邪法を授けるという……。

　それがアシエンについての通説であり、実態とも相違はない。一方で「暁の血盟」は彼らの正体とでもいうべき真実を突き止めている。

　アシエンは、ゾディアーク召喚の中核を担った組織「十四人委員会」の生き残り、あるいは転生後に再加入した者たちだ。前者を「オリジナル」、後者を「転生組」と呼び、末端の傀儡を除くと総勢13名となる。すなわちアログリフ、ミトロン、エメトセルク、パシュタロット、ファダニエル、ウルテマ、ハルマルト、ナプリアレス、イゲオルム、デュダルフォン、エメロロアルス、ラハブレア、エリディブスである。これらは座の名前、つまり役職名のようなもので、該当者が消滅すれば同質の魂を持った別人が召し上げられていた。

　その目的は世界統合によるゾディアークの復活。そして現生生命を贄として古代人を復活させることである。原初世界と鏡像世界の両側で争いの火種を蒔き、次元圧壊のきっかけを作っている。","","False","0x00000047","",""

After the world was divided into ten and three, the unsundered Ascians sought to reconvene their council to facilitate the rejoining of reflections.

Thus did the unsundered find it necessary to prepare crystals replete with the knowledge and memories tied to each office.

As a defector, Azem and <var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var> legacy were deemed unworthy of preservation.

　世界が分割されたあと、生き延びたオリジナルのアシエンたちは、世界統合に向けて再び仲間を集めなければならなかった。十四人委員会の面々から分かたれた魂を召し上げることでそれを果たしたものの、別人として転生している以上、古き時代の記憶はない。そこでオリジナルたちが各座についての記憶を寄せ集め、クリスタルに封じたのだ。

　離脱したアゼムについては知る必要がないと判断され、クリスタルも作られなかった。しかし親友のエメトセルクには思うところがあったのだろう、密かにそれを用意して、たったひとつでその人物を物語れる術を込めていたのだ。それこそが、アゼム自身の創り上げた召喚術。困難を前にしたとき、ともに解決する仲間を喚び寄せる魔法である。

　現在、そのクリスタルは光の戦士が所有している。冒険にも、生きていくのにも困難はつきものだ。それらに立ち向かう強い決意を抱いたとき、クリスタルは輝いて応じるだろう。","","False","0x0000004A","",""

"","A century before─by that reflection's measure of time─the Warrior of Light and <var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var> companions journeyed to the First, it underwent a terrible transformation which forever changed the world. A failed Ascian attempt to set in motion an Eighth Umbral Calamity on the Source triggered a Flood of Light, which then swept across the land, leaving naught but blank perfection in its wake.

The tale of the Flood is one of hubris and tragedy. Hoping to restore peace to an embattled world, brave Warriors of Light fought and felled the Shadowkeeper, steward of Darkness─but in their decisive victory unbalanced the cosmic scales. Though Hydaelyn's agent, the Oracle of Light, managed to stem the ravenous tide and prevent the First's utter annihilation, much was lost. Only Norvrandt─a region the approximate size of Eorzea─remained habitable.

Contrary to traditional associations between light and the astral, the Light that consumed the First is characterized by passivity and tranquility─what scholars of the Source would term “umbral” polarity. Thus did the lands claimed by the Flood, known as the “Empty,” come to reach a state of stasis utterly bereft of aetheric activity. Norvrandt itself would be cursed with an empty sky of unyielding Light and ravenous hordes of Light-warped creatures.

Save for the greatest among them─the Lightwardens─these “sin eaters” are largely mindless beings, seeking only to corrupt the aether of the living and give rise to more of their own. Nevertheless, for the First's remaining population, it has been a constant struggle to keep these fiends at bay. Only since the Scions of the Seventh Dawn arrived to destroy the extant Lightwardens and purge Norvrandt of Light's corruption have its people known a measure of peace. They yet pay homage to their heroes as “Warriors of Darkness” for their role in restoring the night sky.","　鏡像世界のひとつ。その時間軸においておよそ100年前、世界の在り方を変える大事件が発生した。当時はアシエンが第八霊災を起こすべく暗躍し、影の王なる存在を立てて争いを引き起こしていたのだが、これを第一世界の「光の戦士たち」であるアルバート一行が討ち倒したことで問題が生じる。平和をもたらすために闇を掃うというその行いが、悲しいかな、世界を決定的に光属性に傾け「光の氾濫」を誘発させてしまったのだ。
　原初世界より渡ってきた「光の巫女」が氾濫を食い止めたときには、すでに多くの土地が呑み込まれ、エオルゼアに相当する「ノルヴラント」地域を残すのみとなっていた。

　光属性とは、霊極性とも呼ばれる静穏と停滞の力だ。氾濫に呑み込まれた土地はエーテルの巡りさえも滞った「無の大地」となった。それを免れたノルヴラントでさえも空は無尽光に覆われ、夜の闇が失われた。生き残りたちに追い打ちをかけたのは、体内エーテルが光属性に寄りすぎたことで変質した異形「罪喰い」の存在である。罪喰いに高い知能はなく、本能に従ってエーテルを喰らい、仲間を増やす。唯一「大罪喰い」と呼称された上位個体を退けることができれば一帯の光属性が抑えられ、人の生存圏を確保することができた。

　世界を渡った「暁の血盟」の活躍によって、現在はノルヴラント全域から過剰な光が掃われている。第一世界の人々は敬意をこめ、彼らを「闇の戦士」と呼ぶのだった。","","False","0x0000004D","",""

"","Son of House Leveilleur, it was at the tender age of eleven that Alphinaud and his twin sister, Alisaie, were accepted into the prestigious Studium. There, he specialized in the study of arcane entities, history and natural history, and pursued advanced studies in the magical arts and aetherology. Upon graduating at sixteen, the Sharlayan age of adulthood, he resolved to sail for Eorzea in spite of his father's objections. Alphinaud has since worked to see his grandfather's wishes made reality. It is why he joined the Scions, and later why he founded the Crystal Braves. With the latter, however, the Ul'dahn elite utilized Alphinaud's inflated confidence to their advantage, wresting the Braves from his control and delivering the young man a bitter defeat.

Swallowing his despair, Alphinaud traveled with the Warrior of Light and Tataru to Ishgard, a nation locked in the thousand-year Dragonsong War. There he engaged with various factions and individuals who sought to resolve the conflict in their own way, among them Archbishop Thordan VII, Ser Aymeric, the Azure Dragoon Estinien, and the heretic Ysayle. The experience prompted him to reevaluate his view of the world as well as his purpose, and as the war neared its conclusion, he reached his own: he would not be a man who sacrifices friends and family for a cause. In spite of the risk to himself, he swore to rescue Estinien, who had been corrupted by the influence of Nidhogg's shade, and with the aid of the Warrior of Light succeeded in saving the dragoon's life.

Alphinaud's involvement in the provincial rebellions that followed taught him further life lessons. He saw firsthand the crushing defeat dealt to the Ala Mhigan Resistance in Rhalgr's Reach by Zenos and the XIIth Imperial Legion. Undeterred, the young Scion then journeyed to the Far East with his comrades, braving haunted seas, and helped the Domans to free themselves from imperial rule. Having won an ally in Hien, Doma's rightful king, he returned to Eorzea to once more aid the Ala Mhigans in their fight against the Empire. At length the Eorzean Alliance laid siege to Ala Mhigo, where Zenos ruled as viceroy, and succeeded in vanquishing the imperial occupiers. With peace thus restored to the land, Alphinaud enjoyed a moment of adventure as he joined the Warrior of Light and fellow Scion Arenvald in a quest for lost treasure.

In the course of these experiences, Alphinaud learned of the Populares, a moderate faction in Garlean politics that sought to bring change to its provincial policy. Together with one of its members, a soldier named Maxima, he embarked on a diplomatic mission to the imperial capital. An unexpected attack en route put a premature end to his plans, but his subsequent chance meeting with Gaius led to another opportunity. Long thought dead, the former legatus had taken to working independently in the shadows, and their encounter resulted in an unlikely alliance that set in motion events which would alter the course of history.

After coming to the First, Alphinaud applied himself earnestly and continued to ponder the true meaning of salvation. He did not shrink before Lord Vauthry, the godlike mayor of Eulmore, who believed himself to be mankind's sole deliverance, nor did he hesitate to voice his opposition when Emet-Selch revealed his intent to restore the past at the cost of the future. By these acts, he showed that the salvation that he had once striven to bring to others had transcended hollow ideals and become a tangible endeavor. And in the face of the Telophoroi threat in the Source, his long-held dream was realized with the formation of the Grand Company of Eorzea. With the combined might of not only the city-states but the myriad tribes besides, this organization united the realm in a way its ignominious precursor, the Crystal Braves, could not.

As he continued to walk his long path, Alphinaud was unexpectedly reunited with his father Fourchenault. In their first meeting since he left Sharlayan behind, he was made to question the wisdom of his course─of going to war to effect change. But encouraged by his comrades, his sister Alisaie not least of all, he was able to find his answer: for those he holds dear, he would always choose to fight.

Even now, with the Final Days averted, Alphinaud labors on behalf of those in need. And he will ever do so, forging ahead one step at a time towards the better tomorrow he envisions.","　シャーレアンの名門ルヴェユール家の御曹司。弱冠11歳にして、双子の妹であるアリゼーとともに、シャーレアン魔法大学への入学を許された天才である。その後、魔法学やエーテル学など複数の分野で修士号を取得。卒業後、成人年齢である16歳になったのを機に、父の反対を押し切る形でエオルゼアへと渡航した。すべては、祖父ルイゾワの遺志を継ぐため。そのために「暁の血盟」に加わり、クリスタルブレイブを創設したが、彼の増長はウルダハの権力者たちに利用され挫折を経験することになる。

　失意の中、アルフィノは光の戦士やタタルとともに、雪深きイシュガルドへ向かう。そこでは教皇トールダンや神殿騎士団総長アイメリク、竜騎士エスティニアン、竜に与する「異端」としてシヴァを己の身に降ろしたイゼルなどが、それぞれの立場から千年間続く竜詩戦争を終結へと導かんとしていた。彼らとの出会いや別れ、数々の戦いを経て、アルフィノは世界と自身の目的を見つめ直していく。そして戦争終結のとき、彼は光の戦士に「友を救える男になりたい」との決意を語り、邪竜に乗っ取られたエスティニアンを決死の思いで救い出したのだった。

　続く解放戦争への協力も、アルフィノにとってかけがえのない経験の連続となる。祖国解放を目指してラールガーズリーチに集ったアラミゴ解放軍が、ガレマール帝国軍第XII軍団長ゼノスによって蹂躙される様を目の当たりにした。苦手とする幽霊の彷徨う海域を越え、辿りついたドマでは、ヒエンのもとに集う烈士たちとともに駆けた。彼らやエオルゼア諸国と一致団結して、ついにゼノスが拠点とするアラミゴ王城へと攻め上った。かくして平和を取り戻したその地で、光の戦士や年の近い友人アレンヴァルドと、隠された財宝を巡る冒険に胸躍らせた……。
　帝国と死闘を繰り広げた一方、かの国にも属州政策に反対する民衆派と呼ばれる人々がいることを知ったアルフィノは、そのうちのひとりであるマキシマと帝都を目指す。道中で襲撃を受けて断念を余儀なくされたものの、帝国軍を離れて暗躍するガイウスと絆を結べたことは彼自身と世界に新たな変化をもたらしたといえるだろう。

　第一世界に渡ってからも、アルフィノは世界と向き合い、かつて未熟だった己が掲げた「世界の救済」とはいかなるものか学び続けた。同じく人々の救済を打ち出していたユールモアの長ヴァウスリーと真っ向から対峙。古き時代を取り戻さんとするエメトセルクには、世界を譲り渡せはしないのだと誰より先に決意を示した。もはや彼の目指す救済は言葉ばかりのものではなく、あまたの経験によって実体を得ていたのだ。
　その理念ある行動が結実し、原初世界ではテロフォロイという脅威を前に「グランドカンパニー・エオルゼア」が結成される。それはかつてクリスタルブレイブが成し得なかった、国という壁を超えて問題解決に挑む組織だった。

　そんな長き歩みを経て、久々に再会した父フルシュノは彼に問う。問題解決のために戦いを選ぶこと、それは本当に賢明な道なのかと。その言葉に深く悩んだアルフィノだったが、友に後押しされ、仲間たちと困難に挑み、ともに成長してきたアリゼーと語らう中で答えを得たようだ。国も世界も超えて出会ってきたかけがえのない人々のため、彼らとともに、戦い続ける……ときに声を張り、ときに武器を抜きながら。
　終末を退けた今も、アルフィノは誰かのために奔走している。愛すべき世界を得た彼は、諦めることなく一歩ずつ、より良き明日に向かって進み続けていくことだろう。","","False","0x00000051","",""

"","Alisaie is Alphinaud's twin sister—though she dislikes that their similarity leads people to mistake her for her brother. Though unmistakably a prodigy, she has, in their sixteen years together, always trailed ever so slightly behind him. Her grandfather, however, never treated her as secondary, and as such Alisaie clearly misses Louisoix dearly, still holding him in higher regard than any other.

Shortly after Alisaie gained admission to the Studium at the age of eleven, Louisoix resolved to return to Eorzea in order to save the realm from the Seventh Umbral Calamity. His son Fourchenault attempted to dissuade him, asserting that the wise abjure conflict, but the elder Archon responded with words that have remained in Alisaie's heart: “To ignore the plight of those one might conceivably save is not wisdom─it is indolence. We must all protect that which we hold most dear in the manner of our own choosing.” Louisoix upheld his creed to the end, and vanished amidst the fire and fury of the Calamity.

Wishing to know the fate of her beloved grandfather and what he had sacrificed himself for, Alisaie journeyed to Eorzea together with Alphinaud years later. Disappointment awaited her, as she found all the city-states struggling with fundamental problems, with none making any progress towards addressing them. Distancing herself from her brother and the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, who proactively aided the nations, she struck out on her own to investigate the truth of the Calamity─and better understand the realm.

In the course of her solitary endeavors, Alisaie uncovered a scheme between the Warriors of Darkness and the Ascians, with her family friend Urianger somehow involved. Seeking to thwart their plot to sow chaos, as well as ascertain Urianger's allegiance, she made the decision to join with the Scions formally.

Since then, Alisaie has fought fearlessly on the front lines. Taking up the rapier in place of the grimoire she received from her grandfather, she played a key role in the liberation of both Doma and Ala Mhigo before helping to save the First from all-consuming Light. Countless times has she been cast down, battered and discouraged, but never has she failed to rise up again and carry on the fight. And in the course of her struggles, she came to accept her grandfather's wisdom and likewise love the world that he gave his life to protect.

During her time in the First, Alisaie tended to the Light-afflicted souls who were living out their days at the Inn at Journey's Head. Determined to save a boy named Halric, it was by her initiative that a cure for sin eater corruption was devised. The method was subsequently adapted into a treatment for tempering─a condition long held to be irreversible─and used to cure not only the koboldling Ga Bu, but the countless people whom the Telophoroi had transformed into the primal Anima's mindless thralls.

In the chaos of the Final Days as well, Alisaie showed unfaltering courage. When the enemy came in force, she charged into the fray; when souls wanted for succor, she rushed to their aid. In this way she lived up to her grandfather's words, protecting that which she holds dear in the manner of her own choosing.

Through it all, Alisaie's sights have never strayed from one individual: the Warrior of Light. Driven by the desire to stand shoulder to shoulder with the hero, she strives to better herself that she may one day count herself <var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var> equal.","　アルフィノの双子の妹。アルフィノと同様、弱冠11歳でシャーレアン魔法大学への入学を果たす。はたから見れば彼女も神童だが、何でもそつなくこなす兄に若干の負い目があったのは事実。そんな自分を兄と分け隔てなく可愛がってくれた祖父ルイゾワを慕っており、祖父は彼女の一番の誇りでもあった。
　ルイゾワは彼女の大学入学を見届けたのち、第七霊災の危機から人々を救うため、エオルゼアへと向かうことを決断した。戦乱に身を投じることを忌避する息子フルシュノに対し、「助けられる人が目の前にいるときに、我が身を案じて助けぬとは怠惰というもの。それでは到底、人として進歩的とは言えぬ」と語っていたという。そうしてシャーレアン本国をあとにしたルイゾワは、第七霊災の最中に消息を絶ち、二度と故郷に帰ってくることはなかった。

　アリゼーは悲しみ、怒った。祖父の最期に何があったのか、そして彼が命を賭してまで護ろうとしたエオルゼアとはいかなる場所なのだろうか。それを自ら確かめるべく、彼女はアルフィノとともにエオルゼアを訪問し……大いに落胆した。どこの国も問題だらけで、解決に向けて前進しているようにも思えなかったからである。アリゼーは、それらの問題と積極的に関わろうとするアルフィノや「暁の血盟」ともしばし距離を置き、独自に第七霊災の真実を調査するとともに、エオルゼアを見定めようとしていたようだ。
　その中で、各地の蛮神を討伐していたアルバートら「闇の戦士」と、アシエンが密会しているのを目撃。彼らの企みを阻止するため……そしてなぜか密会に同席していたウリエンジェの思惑を確かめるためにも、アリゼーは光の戦士たちに合流する。

　以来、「暁の血盟」の前線で戦い続けてきた彼女。祖父から入学祝いに贈られた魔道書を細剣に持ち替えて、解放戦争や、第一世界での戦いを乗り越えてきた。ときに大きな怪我を負い、ときに親しい者の死に直面しながらも、彼女は全身全霊で立ち上がる。大好きな祖父を奪った世界というものが、いつしか自身にとってもかけがえのないものになっていたのだ。
　中でも、第一世界で「旅立ちの宿」に滞在し、罪喰いになりかけた少年ハルリクと出会ったのは印象深い出来事だっただろう。彼を治療するためにベーク＝ラグらの協力を得て確立した術は、原初世界において、不治とされてきた蛮神のテンパードを治療する術へと発展した。それによってタイタンのテンパードにされてしまったコボルド族のガ・ブを救えたのみならず、のちにテロフォロイによって蛮神「アニマ」のテンパードとされた多くの人々が自我を取り戻せたのだ。

　終末の災厄を巡る戦いでも、圧倒的な困難に対し、彼女は果敢に挑み続けた。敵を切り伏せるのみならず、困窮した者がいれば手を差し伸べ、声を掛け、励ましてきた。かつてルイゾワがフルシュノに告げた言葉に倣うとすれば、アリゼーは紛れもなく、敬愛する祖父と同じ「進歩的な」人物だといえるだろう。
　彼女の視線の先には、ともに幾多の試練を乗り越えてきた、光の戦士の姿がある。その背に追いつき、いつかは並び立ちたいという目標を胸に、今日も力いっぱい走っていくのだ。","","False","0x00000055","",""

"","The Garlean Empire once controlled the majority of the Three Great Continents, the enormous landmass that encompasses Eorzea. Until some fifty years ago, Garlemald was a remote and sparsely populated nation which held little more than a fraction of the northern continent of Ilsabard. But with the arrival of a technological golden age and the concurrent emergence of a brilliant young legatus, Solus Galvus, in the span of a single generation Garlemald established itself as one of the most formidable forces in all of Hydaelyn.

Garlemald is unsurpassed in the field of magitek, a technology which it exploits with devastating effectiveness in warfare. Unperturbed by their lesser numbers, the Garleans went forth upon gigantic flying warships, bearing powerful weaponry the likes of which the world had never seen. One nation after the next fell before their relentless onslaught, first those of the northlands, followed by the sovereign states of the eastern continent, Othard. Employing suppression and conciliation in equal measure, Garlemald indoctrinated the peoples it conquered, thus integrating them into its ever-expanding territory. So it was that the Garlean Empire came into existence.

In the year 1557 of the Sixth Astral Era, the Garleans brought their campaign of conquest to Eorzea, swiftly bringing the city<var 1F /var>state of Ala Mhigo to its knees. Yet following the subjugation of Ala Mhigo, the Empire suddenly ceased its aggressive expansion.

For a time, it seemed as though the Empire's complete subjugation of the world was all but inevitable. However, Emperor Solus's failing health and eventual death triggered a war of succession, and following a protracted campaign on Eorzean soil, Gaius van Baelsar and his XIVth Legion suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the newly unified Eorzean Alliance. Thus did cracks begin to appear in the Empire's armor, and as the Scions of the Seventh Dawn continued to intervene on behalf of the oppressed, the Garleans went on to lose control of Doma in the east and Ala Mhigo in the west. To compound their woes, the new emperor, Varis, had scarcely won the throne before he was slain by his son Zenos, who had an agenda all his own.

Zenos then colluded with the Ascian Fandaniel, and using his father's corpse as a medium, summoned forth the primal Anima. The imperial capital, which had become the stage for a bloody civil war, fell silent as nearly every soldier and civilian remaining was turned into a tempered slave.

Though both Anima and the Telophoroi have since been eliminated, Garlemald struggles to recover from the devastation. The leaders of the subjugated territories bide their time, making no moves to resurrect the fallen Empire, and it remains to be seen what the future holds.","　アルデナード小大陸が属す西州を除き、世界最大の大陸「三大州」をほぼ掌中に収めていた帝政国家。半世紀前まで北州イルサバード大陸の辺境国に過ぎなかったが、技術革新と卓越した軍才を有す将ソル・ガルヴァスの出現により、一躍、ハイデリンに覇を唱える強国へと躍進を遂げた。

"","The term magitek collectively refers to the advanced technology widely employed by the Garlean Empire. Utilizing ceruleum as a source of power, it has found practical applications in all aspects of life, from everyday conveniences such as heaters and radios, to weapons of destruction such as flying warships.

The history of magitek can be traced back to the year 1513, when a man named Solus Galvus attained the rank of legatus. The twenty-four-year-old Garlean learned of the newly invented ceruleum engine, and saw great potential in it. His was the hand that guided the development of magitek weapons, and his the mind that devised tactics for these warmachina. Galvus also saw them integrated into the army, and so imbued the military with mechanical might.

Innately ungifted in magic, the Garleans once relied upon mages recruited from foreign lands to bolster their armies. Not only did magitek free them from that dependence─it transformed them into a machine of conquest.","　ガレマール帝国で用いられている先進技術の総称。青燐水を動力源に利用することで発展を遂げたもので、効率のいい暖房やラジオなどの民生品から、空を飛ぶ飛空戦艦に至るまで、様々な品が実用化されてきた。

　その歴史を辿ってみよう。先天的に魔法の扱いが不得手であるガレアン人は、古くは他所から魔法兵を雇い入れるなどの方法で戦力や労働力を補ってきた。しかし第六星暦1513年、弱冠24歳で軍団長に就任した「ソル・ガルヴァス」という名の若者が、当時、実用化されたばかりの「青燐機関」と呼ばれる発動機に着目。軍事予算の大半を割いて、青燐機関を動力源とする移動プラットフォームに火砲を搭載した、自走砲を開発させたのだ。
　彼はこの奇妙な兵器を、「魔法の代替となる力」として「魔導兵器」と命名。以後、彼は魔導兵器を利用した戦術を研究しつつ、その結果を反映させた軍制の改革に着手、ガレマール共和国軍の機械化を推進したのであった。","","False","0x0000005B","",""

"","For centuries, the Garleans warred with the Corvosi for control of the warm and fertile lands south of Ilsabard's central mountains, but they were eventually defeated and driven into the northern wastes. Winters in the Garleans' new home were harsh. The northern seas were bound in ice for most of the year, and the resources of the waters were available for only a slim window. Likewise, farming and rearing animals were possible only at certain times. The land, in other words, could not support a large populace. The Garleans multiplied slowly, and over time were forced to accept being few in number.

There was but one benefit to the frigid land—its vast deposits of ceruleum. This deep-blue liquid burned as well as oil, and kept the hearth warm during the long, dark times of year. Indeed, had it not been for this natural resource, the Garleans would not have survived the severe winter cold. Yet, it was to be a long time before the advent of the ceruleum engine, and the Garleans realized what a boon this liquid was.","　イルサバード大陸の中央山脈南部、温暖で肥沃な土地を巡って、コルヴォ人と長く争い続けてきたガレアン人。やがて敗北した彼らが追いやられた大陸北部は、冬季になると厳しい寒さに襲われる寒冷地であり、とくに北に面した海は一年の大半が氷に覆われるという有様で、海洋資源も活かし辛い環境であった。限定的な条件下での農業、漁業、畜産では、とてもではないが大人数を養うことはできない。彼らの人口は伸び悩み、長きにわたり、少数民族の立場に甘んじることとなった。

　寒さの厳しい土地に封じ込められたガレアン族にとって、唯一の救いは、領内に「青燐泉」があったことだろう。ここから湧き出す青味を帯びた液体は、油のようによく燃えるため燃料となる。「青燐水」と呼ばれるこの天然資源がなければ、暖を取ることもできず越冬は難しかったはずだ。

In stark contrast to other Sharlayan organizations that would adopt their city-state's policy of nonintervention, the Students have often collaborated with foreign scholars in their never-ending pursuit of knowledge. G'raha Tia's assignment to the Sons of Saint Coinach during the Crystal Tower expedition, as well as the Students' constant support of the Circle of Knowing and their successor, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, are two notable examples of this philosophy in practice. Since their conception, this academic collective has also served as an advisory body to the Forum and other influential parties, identifying potential threats to mankind and providing counsel as needed.

The Students' headquarters were once located on the Isle of Val, a remote island south of Sharlayan which Galuf had purchased with considerable funds accumulated over the course of many adventures. The facilities constructed there allowed his organization to thrive and perform research independent of the Sharlayan motherland, but this selfsame independence rendered them uniquely vulnerable to attack. The Isle of Val abruptly vanished one day, and it was later determined that a terrible magick was responsible, having obliterated the isle and nearly all who were present at the time.

"","A member of the Scions, Thancred grew up in the backstreets of Limsa Lominsa, and spent his adolescence snatching purses with a band of petty thieves. One day, he targeted an Elezen man who had come to the maritime city-state to study aether. Unbeknownst to Thancred, that man was Louisoix Leveilleur and just as the boy drew near, the Archon sent him flying to the cobbles. Caught red-handed, Thancred was certain he would be tossed onto one of the city-state's prison hulks. Instead, Louisoix offered him an alternative─use his gods-given agility to aid his fellow man. Thus, the Midlander boy returned with the Archon to Sharlayan, and there began to study survival and intelligence gathering techniques. He became an expert in both, then an Archon, and then a member of the Circle of Knowing.

In the years leading up to the Seventh Umbral Calamity, Thancred was dispatched to Ul'dah on a mission of paramount importance. He would work surreptitiously to undermine the interests of the Garlean Empire, who had begun preparations for a future campaign of conquest in Eorzea. In the course of his duties, he was present at a parade during which a goobbue broke free and rampaged through the city, resulting in the death of a man named Warburton. Though his identity as a double agent for the Empire and Ala Mhigan Resistance were of particular interest, Warburton's true legacy would be Ascilia, the daughter he left behind, and for whose welfare Thancred thenceforth felt personally responsible.

While Thancred wanted to ensure Ascilia's safety and well-being, his responsibilities meant that he could not act as a proper guardian. The songstress F'lhaminn instead adopted her, though Thancred made a point to visit when he could, as well as bestow upon her a new name to help hide her from her father's enemies. Thus did she come to be known as Minfilia Warde, and while she grew older over the years, a part of him always saw her as that crying child in the streets─a daughter for whom Thancred should have done more.

In the wake of the Calamity, fate would see both Thancred and Minfilia join the Scions of the Seventh Dawn─he as a member, and she as their leader. Thancred was instrumental in many of the Scions' victories, but the events that followed the bloody banquet would forever change him. While holding off pursuers with Y'shtola during their escape from Ul'dah, the mage cast a forbidden spell to facilitate a swift escape. There were consequences, however, and his journey through the Lifestream saw him lose his ability to properly control aether and magicks. Yet what pained him far more was the loss of Minfilia, who had gone missing in the chaos. His grief was further compounded when he learned she had been summoned to Hydaelyn's side to serve as the Word of the Mother, a vessel for the deity's will─and one seemingly devoid of Minfilia's.

The two were reunited after the Scions' clash with Ardbert and the Warriors of Darkness, where Urianger called upon Hydaelyn to intercede on behalf of the First. Hearing this earnest appeal, the Word of the Mother appeared and resolved to journey with the fallen champions unto their world and save it from the Flood of Light. Though Hydaelyn spoke through her, Thancred realized to his relief that Minfilia was still present...but this joy was tempered by the understanding that they would soon part ways once more. Bitter though it was, Thancred accepted this outcome, for he knew that Minfilia would make him proud.

Thancred was the first of the Scions called to Norvrandt by the Crystal Exarch. After his arrival he learned of how the Word of the Mother had sacrificed herself, and of the existence of the Oracle of Light, a girl who had inherited Minfilia's name and soul both. To save her from a life of imprisonment, he breached the gaols of Eulmore and took her into hiding. He taught the Oracle how to fight and survive, and continued to care for her well after the other Scions joined him on the First. Though their relationship was complicated, no matter how daunting the foe, the two would stand together, for Thancred believed he had found in the Oracle another chance─another daughter for the one he had lost. And when she found the strength to stand for herself and not be defined by Minfilia's legacy, Thancred would bestow upon her a new name: Ryne, his “blessing.”

Now returned to the Source, Thancred continues to fight for the future of the star Minfilia loved so much. He often travels with his boon companion, Urianger, who notes that Thancred has developed a habit of gazing at the night sky, a smile on his face as he considers the stars. Though one can only speculate what he is thinking in those moments, Urianger likes to believe his thoughts are of Ryne─and that no matter the distance between them, in his heart they are never far apart.","　「暁の血盟」に所属するヒューラン族の男性。幼少期はリムサ・ロミンサの裏通りでコソ泥まがいの生活を送っていた。エーテル学の研究のために海都を訪れていた賢人ルイゾワと出会い、その私物を盗もうと接近したものの、見事に返り討ちに。官憲に突き出されることを予期したが、ルイゾワは訴えるどころか、天性の身軽さという才を人のために使うように諭し、シャーレアンに連れ帰ったのだった。かくして北洋諸島に渡った後、当地で専門的な訓練を受けた彼は、サバイバル術と諜報活動のスペシャリストとして賢人位を取得したのである。

"","Like Hydaelyn, Zodiark is one of the eldest and most powerful of primals. To define what exactly He is, one must first define Light and Darkness─polar opposites whose core components differ from the six main elements of which the star is composed.

The ancients classified Light as that which governs tranquility and stasis. It is a pure white energy bereft of color or movement, and in modern terminology, an element of this nature would be defined as “umbral.” In contrast, Darkness was classified as that which spurs growth. It is an energy of deepest black─a cacophony of life's myriad colors─and contemporary scholars would define elements of this active nature as “astral.” As such, Zodiark is Darkness and activity given form, while Hydaelyn, who would be His undoing, was conceived as the embodiment of peace and Light everlasting. In the world unsundered, these concepts lacked any associations with good and evil; Light and Darkness were simply fundamental energies that coexisted in all things.

Approximately twelve thousand years ago, a vast quantity of Darkness was required to forestall the coming of the Final Days, that its dynamic nature might ensure that the celestial currents of Etheirys did not stagnate. So it was that the ancients devised a plan to create a god who would embody Darkness itself, and at the order of the Convocation of Fourteen, half of the star's surviving population gave their lives to bring Zodiark into being.

Serving as the primal's heart was the emissary Elidibus. Though countless ancients sacrificed their physical aether and tethered their very souls to Zodiark, Elidibus, having judged his duties unfinished, created a reflection of himself to keep vigil over his allies. Zodiark's untold power averted disaster for a time...yet those who survived and had come to worship Him sought to perpetuate the cycle of sacrifice. They vowed to reap the new life they had sown in His name to resurrect those who had rendered up their essence to fuel the primal's summoning.

Venat and her followers stood in opposition to Zodiark's faithful. Believing that a new generation should inherit Etheirys, they summoned forth Hydaelyn, a second primal born of collective sacrifice, with Venat to serve as Her heart. And so Hydaelyn brought Her tranquil Light to bear against Zodiark's relentless Darkness in a terrible battle. Hydaelyn narrowly emerged the victor, and with Her final strike sundered Zodiark and the star itself into fourteen shards. With Her enemy fragmented and too weak to resist, Hydaelyn created a moon for each shard─a series of gaols in which the divided Zodiark would be sealed for all eternity.

Outraged by the sundering of their world and their god, the Ascians─those who had belonged to the Convocation of Fourteen─resolved to revive Zodiark and restore the broken world to the paradise it once was. For millennia they plotted against Hydaelyn and Her followers, orchestrating events to achieve their ultimate goal, until one of their own chose to forsake this solemn charge.

The Ascian Fandaniel, upon regaining his memories and understanding his true nature, rejected his role in his brethren's machinations. After learning of Elidibus's defeat on the First, he resolved instead to destroy Zodiark. Using Garlemald as his base of operations, the rogue Ascian orchestrated the summoning of the primal Anima, who would siphon aether from across the star and direct it into the Tower of Babil. Utilizing the tower as an aetheric cannon, Fandaniel crippled the mechanisms on the moon which kept Zodiark imprisoned, and subsequently traveled there to seize control of the elder primal by offering himself as His new heart.

Though the Ascian was laid low by the Warrior of Light, Fandaniel reveled in Zodiark's defeat, as his ultimate goal was the return of the Final Days. In a final act of defiance, Zodiark reached into His chest and shattered His own heart, consigning the elder primal to a permanent death.

With His demise on the Source, it is presumed that the reflections of Zodiark in other shards were destroyed as well, and the once-fettered souls of the ancients are finally free to return to the Lifestream.","　ハイデリンと同じく、古き時代に創られた蛮神。

　その性質を述べるにあたっては、まず光と闇の力を定義すべきだろう。それは火、風、雷、水、氷、土の六大元素とは異なるものである。
　鎮静と停滞を司る力を、いにしえの人々はまっさらな白きものとみなして「光」と呼んだ。現代の原初世界においては「霊極性」とも定義される、凪と平穏をもたらす力である。
　一方、活発と発展を司る力を、多くの色が重なった黒きものとみなして「闇」と呼んだ。現代の原初世界においては「星極性」とも定義される、万物万象を活性化させる力である。
　ゾディアークは闇の化身として創造され、その枷となる役割を負ったハイデリンは光の化身として創造された。始まりはただそれだけのことであり、光と闇は善悪にあらず、ともに必要不可欠な表裏一体の力に過ぎなかったのだ。

　では、なぜ強大な闇の化身を創り出す必要があったのだろうか。その要因は、およそ一万二千年前にこの星を襲った「終末の災厄」という大災害にある。被害を食い止めるためには「天脈」と呼ばれる大きなエーテルの流れを補強しなければならない。そこで活性の、すなわち闇の力を有する神が設計されたというわけである。
　ゾディアークの召喚にあたっては、災厄から生き延びた者の約半数が糧として命を捧げ、人類の代表者たる「十四人委員会」が術を行使した。この際、核となったのは同委員会の調停者エリディブスだった。彼はゾディアークとなったものの、のちに仲間たちを案じて分身を生み出し、エリディブスとしての活動を再開させている。ゾディアークの糧となった者についても、肉体はエーテルに還元され消費された一方で、魂はかの神の内に保存されていたらしい。天脈を補強して災厄を退けたのち、さらに贄を捧げて荒廃した星の再生を行ったが、最終的には新たに芽生えた生命と引き換えに神の内に眠る人々を復活させる計画だったようだ。

　それに待ったをかけたのが、ヴェーネスだった。星の未来は新たな世代に任せるべきであると主張した彼女は、支持者とともに光の蛮神ハイデリンを創り、ゾディアークと死闘を繰り広げる。結果はハイデリンの辛勝。鎮めるための力、すなわち光の力による一撃が、世界ごとゾディアークを十四に分断したのだった。
　彼女は月を創り出し、分かたれたゾディアークを封じた。以来、かの神を復活させんと暗躍するアシエン……かつての十四人委員会と、ハイデリンの攻防が続いてきたのである。

　しかし、アシエン・ファダニエルの独断により、近年新たな動きが生じる。エリディブスたちの消滅を確認した彼は、与えられた使命に反し、ゾディアークを消滅させんと画策したのだ。まずガレマルドの「バブイルの塔」に蛮神「アニマ」を据えると、その力を用いて世界中からエーテルを集積。これを撃ち込むことで月の封印機構に亀裂を入れた。続いて月に渡り、機構を破壊しきってゾディアークと融合。それを押し留めんとした光の戦士と戦闘になるも、その勝敗によって彼の計画達成が揺らぐことはない。己の心核を躊躇なく握り潰し、世界を救うために創られた古き神は、消滅と相成ったのだった。

　原初世界の本体が消え去ったことで、鏡像世界の月に封じられていた断片も消滅したと考えられている。その内に眠っていた古き人々の魂も、星海へと流れ、生命の巡りに還ったようだ。","","False","0x00000069","",""

"","This young maiden of the First fought the sin eaters alongside the Warrior of Darkness, and played an instrumental role in restoring night to Norvrandt.

It is impossible to speak of Ryne without first speaking of the Oracle of Light, Minfilia. Approximately a century ago, when the Flood of Light threatened to engulf the First, the people of Nabaath Areng bore witness to a woman who single-handedly halted the encroaching radiance. Amidst the tumult, someone was heard crying out “Minfilia”─and so it was that Norvrandt's mysterious savior was named.

Fifteen years later, when the Kingdom of Voeburt fell to sin eaters, a girl was discovered who could not be turned by their corruption. With her hair of spun gold and eyes of clearest sapphire, she bore an uncanny resemblance to the legendary Oracle. Inheriting her name, this Minfilia went on to be a beacon of hope in mankind's struggle against the sin eater threat, but as is the fate of many a soldier, she eventually fell in battle. Some years later, however, another girl would appear who possessed the same distinct features and immunity both. In this way the cycle continued, with a new Minfilia emerging as if to replace the one who had died before her.

This strange phenomenon was brought about by none other than the original Minfilia, the Antecedent of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, who had journeyed from the Source to deliver the First from destruction. Having quelled the Flood, she began reincarnating into the bodies of suitable young girls so that the blessing of Light, the source of resistance to sin eater corruption, might endure. Those who were vessels for Minfilia's soul invariably manifested her features, serving to identify the bearer of the blessing.

Once Vauthry became supreme leader of Eulmore, however, the Oracle was deemed no longer necessary. In truth, Vauthry feared the Oracle and the hope she symbolized, and so he ordered General Ran'jit to find and imprison the next Minfilia to appear. That girl was Ryne (though she was yet to be called thus), and she was locked up deep in the city's dungeon before she had seen five summers. For years she languished there, deprived of the opportunity to develop her powers, until she was rescued by Thancred, whom the Crystal Exarch had summoned from the Source.

The days that followed were filled with excitement and discovery for the young maiden. From Thancred she learned how to live and fight, and over time he became as a father to her. Yet even as she grew closer to him, she began to question his motivations for taking her under his wing. She came to believe it was the original Minfilia that he had sought to save─that he would be happier if she surrendered her body to the woman's soul─and the thought tormented her throughout her journey with the Warrior of Darkness.

In time, the moment of truth would arrive. Tracking down the remaining Lightwardens required that she harness greater power as the Oracle, and it was during a bitter confrontation with Ran'jit that she finally found the strength of will to walk her own path. With Thancred laying his life on the line to secure her escape, she pressed on to inherit her namesake's power and arise as the Oracle in her own right. Driven by the desire to fulfill the legacy of those who went before her, she returned with her hair and eyes restored to their natural hues, and from the man who was her father in all the ways that mattered, she received the name by which she is now known.

With the Lightwardens that once plagued the realm no more, Ryne now dedicates her days to restoring life to the First. Be it bejeweled with stars or a brilliant blue, the sky never fails to remind her of journeys past as well as her family, whose love she feels no matter the distance between them.","　第一世界に暮らす少女。「闇の戦士」の一行として罪喰いと戦い、ノルヴラントに夜の闇を取り戻した。

　それから15年の後、崩壊を迎えたフッブート王国にて、罪喰い化に耐性がある少女が見つかる。伝説の光の巫女と同じ外見の特徴を有していた彼女は「ミンフィリア」の名で呼ばれるようになり、罪喰いに抗う人類の旗印となっていった。やがて彼女は戦いの中で斃れるものの、数年後にはまた同じ特徴を有した少女が発見されたのだった。
　この不可思議な現象は、本物のミンフィリア――第一世界を救うために原初世界から旅立った光の巫女であり、「暁の血盟」の盟主でもある人物――の意思によって引き起こされていた。彼女はノルヴラントを救う鍵となる罪喰い化への耐性、すなわち「光の加護」の存在を示し続けるために、適性のある少女たちの身体に魂を宿らせていたのだ。彼女の魂を受け入れた少女たちは光の巫女に通ずる容姿となり、加護が引き継がれていることを人々に証明したのだった。

　リーンもまた、ミンフィリアの魂を宿していた少女のひとりである。希望の象徴であったはずのその存在は、ヴァウスリーがユールモアの元首になったことで一変してしまった。彼は将軍ランジートを派遣してまだ5歳にもなっていなかった彼女を見つけ出すと監獄棟に幽閉、何の力も育ませず飼い殺しにしようとした。それを救い出したのが、水晶公によって第一世界に招かれたサンクレッドだったのである。
　それからの日々は、少女にとって何もかも新鮮だった。生き方や戦い方をサンクレッドから学び、成長していく。ふたりはまさしく親子のようだった。しかしサンクレッドが身近になっていくほどに、少女は苦悩するようになる。彼が真に救いたいのは本物のミンフィリアであり、この身体を彼女の魂に譲り渡すことこそが幸せなのではないか――そんな想いが渦巻き、「闇の戦士」と合流してからも晴れることはなかったようだ。

　やがて訪れる決断のとき。行方の知れない大罪喰いを見つけ出すためには、より完璧な光の巫女の力が必要だった。不器用な喧嘩の果てに、少女は生きたいという望みを胸に立ち上がり、サンクレッドは立ちはだかるランジートを決死の覚悟で迎え撃ってそれを送り出す。少女は本物のミンフィリアからすべての力を譲り受けて、真なる光の巫女となった。多くの「ミンフィリアたち」が繋いできた灯火で、今度こそノルヴラントを救うために。

The company is second to none when it comes to airships, and it was but a twelvemoon after Cid's defection from the Empire that he designed a civilian model completely craftable with Eorzean resources. Since forging their partnership with Highwind Skyways, the Ironworks has produced countless airships, and is largely responsible for the current era's convenience in sky travel.

While Cid remains the president of the company in name, during his five-year absence following the Calamity, it was a woman named Jessie who saw to the everyday management of the Ironworks. It is said that she remains at the company's helm even now, as Cid's duties often lead him far afield, and hers was the hand that signed the contract enlisting former imperial tribunus and engineering prodigy Nero tol Scaeva into their ranks.

Working tirelessly by the motto “Freedom through Technology,” Cid and his fellow engineers have been a reliable source of innovation. Through their inventions, they have provided the Warrior of Light and their comrades with many a vital breakthrough, and they will doubtless continue to do so.","　「ガーロンド・アイアンワークス」は、第六星暦1562年、亡命帝国人のシド・ガーロンドが、エオルゼアに魔導技術を広めるため設立した会社組織である。彼と意志を同じくする亡命帝国人や、エオルゼアにて知り合った若手技師たちが次々と参加し、飛空艇や青燐機関車、さらには子ども向けの模型に至るまで、さまざまな製品を世に出している。
　特に飛空艇分野においては他の追随を許さず、亡命の翌年には、素材や設計を工夫することでエオルゼアでも製造可能な「軟式飛空艇」を開発。ハイウィンド飛空社と提携することで量産化を行い、空路を拓くことに大きく貢献した。

　なお、会長を務めるのは創業者であるシド自身であるが、第七霊災後の5年間、行方知れずとなっていたため、暫定措置としてジェシーが会長代行を務めてきた。ただし、シドは帰還後も何かにつけて調査や任務に赴いてしまうため、今なおジェシーが経営の最前線で戦い続けているという。最近では彼女の独断で大型新人こと元帝国軍幕僚長のネロを採用した。

　最高峰の技術力を有し、「技術は自由のために」というモットーのもと精力的に活動を続ける彼らは、幾度となく光の戦士たちの活動に突破口を開いてくれた頼もしい存在である。","","False","0x00000070","",""

"","Long ago, the Crystal Exarch came to a fateful conclusion: only a mighty warrior who could defeat the Lightwardens as well as resist their corruption could deliver salvation to Norvrandt. The sole individual he knew capable of such feats─the Warrior of Light─abided in the Source, and thus did he labor to adapt the Crystal Tower's cross-rift travel capabilities that he might bring the hero unto the First.

Success proved elusive. Even after much time and effort, instead of the Warrior of Light, the Exarch ended up summoning their fellow Scions, and incompletely; only their souls successfully made the journey. Though he could weave for them something akin to corporeal forms, their actual bodies remained locked in slumber in the Source, and the connection between flesh and soul would eventually fail, resulting in death. To wit, it was imperative that he found a way to return his unintended guests safely home.

When teleporting, an individual takes their possessions with them by virtue of recognizing those objects as extensions of the self. It was this mechanism that served as the basis of the solution. Receptacles would be created to hold each of the Scions' souls, which the Warrior of Light, who had been summoned whole and complete, would then carry back across the rift to the Source. The finished product, the spirit vessel, also drew inspiration from white auracite, Moenbryda's ingenious invention for capturing an Ascian soul.

However, one other obstacle had to be overcome: the separation of mind and memory. While the two are intrinsically entwined like words writ upon parchment, the latter is wont to fade when the soul is placed into a vessel. In seeking to ensure that their memories remained intact, the companions looked to Allagan memory transference─a technique which required that their spirit vessels be imbued with royal Allagan blood. This blood was provided by the Exarch himself, and it also served to turn these vessels into keys for controlling the Crystal Tower, whose operation was restricted to the ancient empire's rulers.","　その昔、水晶公はひとつの大きな決断をした。ノルヴラントを救うためには、大罪喰いを討つ実力があり「光の加護」によって罪喰い化から護られた人物が必要だ。たったひとりだけ思い当たるその英雄を原初世界から喚び寄せるため、彼はクリスタルタワーに備えられた次元跳躍機能を転用し、長い時間をかけて時空を超える召喚術を作り上げた。
　しかし、多くの時間と努力を重ねてなおその召喚は難しく、対象に近しい「暁」の面々を魂だけという不完全な形で喚び寄せてしまったのである。エーテルを用いて仮初の身体らしきものを構築するも、本物の肉体は原初世界で昏睡状態、やがては魂と肉体の繋がりが消滅して死に至るという危うい状態だった。

　となれば当然、彼らの魂を返さなければならない。テレポなどの転移魔法においては「これは自分の物である」という認識によって物体を自己の延長線上に置くことで衣服なども一緒に転移させている。同様に、魂を何らかの入れ物に封じ、唯一正しく召喚された光の戦士が携行することで元の世界へ帰還させようという計画が持ち上がった。そのために製作された入れ物が、この「ソウル・サイフォン」である。

　魂を収める仕組みについては、かつてアシエンの魂を捕らえるためにムーンブリダが作り出した「白聖石」の仕様が用いられている。ここに魂を封じる際には、本来ならば「紙とそこに書かれた文字」のように離れることのない魂と記憶の結びつきが弱くなる。そこでソウル・サイフォンにはアラグの皇族が用いた記憶継承術も組み込まれ、記憶の欠落を防いでいるのだ。
　それを実現するにあたって、別の用途も生じている。記憶継承術がアラグ皇族の血を媒介としたものであったことから、水晶公は自らの血を結晶化させて素材とした。皇血はクリスタルタワーを制御するための鍵でもある。結果的に、ソウル・サイフォンを所持する者がクリスタルタワーを操作できるようになったのである。","","False","0x00000073","",""
