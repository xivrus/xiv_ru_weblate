The old man then shares the reason behind his lingering reluctance: he believes that his hesitation in ringing the warning bell caused many to die needlessly to the marauding sin eater. Hearing you speak of vengeance, however, appears to provide some relief to his all-consuming guilt. It seems he is ready to return to the village.
