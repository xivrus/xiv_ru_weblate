Ghen Gen is fidgeting even more than usual.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZA201_03375_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Ghen Gen urges you to intervene on his behalf in a matter involving his son Ghun Gun. The young Mord has earned a reputation as a hard worker, although he works a little too hard for his own good, only stopping to rest when specifically instructed to do so. The merchant asks that you travel to the Red Serai and ask Ghun Gun to refrain from any further exertion, lest he work himself to death.

However, he also understands that his refusal to rest would prevent you from fulfilling your promise to Ghen Gen. He suggests that were you to help him uncover a valuable relic or two, he would be able to stop working for at least long enough to catch his breath.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZA201_03375_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;After much scrabbling around under rubble and in the sand, you eventually come across an intricately engraved signet ring.
