        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZA203_03377_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Ghun Gun's idea of a rest appears to involve listening intently to Jamial propose an expedition in search of buried treasure. The aged historian believes that a trail of discarded relics left behind when the Nabaath fled the Flood of Light is waiting to be discovered, and asks you and Ghun Gun to help him with its excavation. Satisfied that standing still for a few moments constitutes rest and recuperation, your Mord companion springs into action, practically salivating at the chance to go digging for more priceless artifacts.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

Jamial posits that it once took pride of place in the Pristine Palace of Amh Malik as a symbol of the friendship between the Nabaath and the Mord.
