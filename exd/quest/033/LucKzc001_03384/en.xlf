They've got me on repair duty, and what with the sorry shape this place is in, it's definitely not a one-man job.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKZC001_03384_SEANARD_000_001&lt;tab&gt;It's a simple enough task. Just take this here pail of mortar, find a couple of spots where the walls are looking ragged, and apply a healthy dab. Thanks, friend─what with our ranks thinned as they are, we need all the help we can get!</target>

It was built nigh on a century ago, by the elves who ruled Lakeland in those days. After the Flood, it's served as one of our bastions of defense against the sin eaters.</target>
