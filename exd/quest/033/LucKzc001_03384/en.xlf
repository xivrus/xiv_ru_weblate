        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZC001_03384_SEANARD_000_001&lt;tab&gt;It's a simple enough task. Just take this here pail of mortar, find a couple of spots where the walls are looking ragged, and apply a healthy dab. Thanks, friend─what with our ranks thinned as they are, we need all the help we can get!</target>

It was built nigh on a century ago, by the elves who ruled Lakeland in those days. After the Flood, it's served as one of our bastions of defense against the sin eaters.</target>

And it's our job to &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;keep&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; it standing─material and manpower shortages be damned.</target>
