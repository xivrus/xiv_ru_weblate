I take it you're the good-natured dupe─er, the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;kindly traveler&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; who's agreed to lug this hefty crate of supplies all the way to the bleedin' Ostall Imperative. Well, here are the goods!</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZC004_03387_ROITATCH_000_021&lt;tab&gt;Jests aside, you do us a great service. We were fortunate when a merchant caravan en route to Amh Araeng decided to sojourn here at the Round for a spell. We were able to restock all manner of supplies that we'd been short on for months.</target>
