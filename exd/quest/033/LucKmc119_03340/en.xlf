As she ponders their significance, her thoughts are interrupted by the fashionably late arrival of Emet-Selch. He bids you make haste in quitting the temple, but soon finds himself similarly captivated by the murals, not out of curiosity but nostalgia. Y'shtola duly invites him to explain what it is they depict, and he obliges with an utterly unforeseeable tale: that Zodiark and Hydaelyn are the eldest of primals, and that it was the Ascians who first conjured them into being. His lesson concluded, Emet-Selch then departs, leaving you and your companions to continue your journey outside in stunned silence.</target>
