        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZA202_03376_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Unfortunately, the merchant is unable to reveal much, other than the fact that the signet ring originates from Nabaath Areng. Given the history of the area, this comes as little surprise. The most useful piece of information you can glean from him is that there is another trader to the south who may be able to shed a touch more light on the matter.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZA202_03376_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;You show the signet ring to the dealer in antiquities, who points out that this was no mere piece of jewelry, but one used by somebody wealthy to seal letters and so forth. Though he lacks the knowledge of ancient sigils required to identify its former owner, he recommends that you consult a man named Jamial, who is apparently the most reliable source of information regarding such artifacts.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZA202_03376_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;You hand the ring to Jamial for inspection, who can scarcely believe his eyes. He reveals that it bears the sigil of a malik, the equivalent of a king in Nabaath Areng. Although the signet is priceless to an expert such as Jamial, he regretfully informs you that only a historian can tell it apart from those used by countless nobles and affluent individuals. Not to be disheartened, Ghun Gun instead views this as a favorable outcome to the day's events, with the satisfaction of a job well done being all the reward he needs.</target>
