It always takes at least three of them to slay one of the creatures, and then they spend an age getting the cutting to Dawkes at the Crystarium. I'd love to tell them just how quickly you manage the same.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZB005_03383_DAWKES_000_012&lt;tab&gt;That may sound a bit cruel─but to hear Bjorn tell it, they will be in serious danger if they don't begin taking their training more seriously. Let's hope that this shocks some sense into them.</target>
