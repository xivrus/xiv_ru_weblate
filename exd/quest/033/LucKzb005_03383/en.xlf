I can't ask you to fight them hand-to-hand, obviously─they aren't even close to ready for that. But perhaps you might show them the ease with which you accomplish the tasks that they find so burdensome.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="52" approved="yes"><source>52</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZB005_03383_BJORN_100_003&lt;tab&gt;Collecting triffid sap in the Forest of the Lost Shepherd, for instance. It always takes at least three of them to slay one of the creatures, and then they spend an age getting the cutting to Dawkes at the Crystarium. I'd love to tell them just how quickly you manage the same.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="53" approved="yes"><source>53</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZB005_03383_BJORN_000_004&lt;tab&gt;You'll want to slay a violet triffid─just one!

I should be able to get quite a large volume of sap from this.

Let's hope that this shocks some sense into them.</target></trans-unit></body></file></xliff>
