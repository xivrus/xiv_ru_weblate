As arrows continue to rain from above, one of three figures jumps down and begins a vicious assault against Y'shtola. It is only after Urianger interrupts the lancer's onslaught that she finds an opportunity to present them with the seal of Ronka. The attack stops almost immediately. The lancer confirms the seal appears to be genuine, but her counterparts towering above in the trees are not yet certain. They invite you to follow the trail of azure flowers to their village. There they will decide if you are friend or foe.</target>
