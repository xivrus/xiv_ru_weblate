Only then do you learn that your quarry is in fact the king and ruler of the faeries, Titania, who defeated a Lightwarden that had threatened Il Mheg, only to be corrupted by the aether that was subsequently released. Though the pixies are convinced that you will perish in the attempt, they readily agree to cooperate─if for no other reason than that it would prove interesting to watch. They duly bestow upon you a white dress, one of four relics required to lift the seal over the castle. If you are to obtain the first of the three remaining items, you will need to set forth for the Untouchable Gate by the lake to request an audience with the slippery Fuath.</target>

While the party considers other ways to reach out to the creatures, the watery voice of a Fuath rings out. It agrees to give you the shell crown relic, but in exchange you must brave the dangers of their domain, Dohn Mheg, in a show of “thrilling sport.” With no other recourse, you make ready to sally forth into unknown waters.
