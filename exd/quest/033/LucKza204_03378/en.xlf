One name in particular stands out among the list of monarchs: Jamial. Ghun Gun, never one to let logic cloud his judgment, jumps to the conclusion that the elderly man with whom you have been traveling must therefore be a ghost of a dead malik, who, satisfied by the discovery of the lost relics, has now passed on to the afterlife, hence his sudden disappearance. Believing that ghosts are plaguing Amh Araeng, he asks that you go with him and report the matter to his father.</target>

The elderly archaeologist reveals that he was named after his grandfather, Jamial IX, the last malik of the Nabaath, and that he wishes to recover their treasures. Ghun Gun is also eager to learn more of his own people's past, and expresses his desire to assist Jamial in further expeditions. As the pair leave to discuss their next outing, Ghen Gen thanks you in their stead for your contributions towards discovering the lost history of Amh Araeng.</target>
