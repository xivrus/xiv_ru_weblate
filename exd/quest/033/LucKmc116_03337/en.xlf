The end is nearly in sight when you encounter a most unexpected obstacle─General Ran'jit. Uimet and Cymet follow him into the temple and, together with their sister, hold him off long enough for you to activate the final switch restoring the flow of aether through the whole of the pyramid, thus opening the path through the Qitana Ravel.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKMC116_03337_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Despite your success, Ran'jit has no intention of allowing you to leave. After making quick work of the Viis sisters, he comes barreling down the corridor toward you. His onslaught is cut short, however, when Y'shtola steps in the way to protect you with a barrier. The Eulmoran adjutant, finally taking notice of his general's struggles, rushes to help him when he steps on a curious panel on the floor. The room begins to tremble, and soon they find the floor falling out from under them, forcing them to a corner opposite the exit, a gaping chasm now preventing their escape.

All present expect a rescue party to arrive, though it remains to be seen if the Scions or Eulmorans will arrive first. Still, not wanting to risk an altercation, the adjutant makes a proposal: a number of the Blessed have been poisoned, and the adjutant is willing to provide you with an antidote, granted he and his commander are allowed safe passage out of the temple. General Ran'jit is disgusted by this proposition, choosing to rid himself of the adjutant and any hope of saving the Blessed by kicking him into the chasm along with the antidote. Without thinking, Y'shtola leaps into the void, grabs hold of the antidote, and tosses it to you before disappearing into the dark.

Her last words continue to ring in your ears as Minfilia, Thancred, and Urianger arrive. General Ran'jit has no time to react as he is summarily ensnared in an enchantment and sent down into the depths with a swift strike from Thancred's gunblade. A bittersweet victory, but victory nonetheless. With the antidote in hand, you take your leave of the pyramid with the Scions.</target>

Before rushing headlong into more danger, however, Thancred suggests waiting for news from Uimet of the Eulmoran forces that entered Yx'Maja. </target>
