He continues to cling to the claim that he comes only to observe your efforts in defeating the Lightwardens, once more offering his hand in partnership. Seeing the Scions' icy─yet entirely expected─response, he takes his leave. Ascian schemes aside, the Scions decide it best to split up to search for the remaining Lightwardens of Norvrandt. You, along with Thancred, Minfilia, and Urianger, have been tasked with seeking out Y'shtola in the Rak'tika Greatwood.</target>

On the way to the Rak'tika Greatwood, he asks that you stop at Fort Jobb and search for a particular tablet in the ruins. It is a holy text he believes may be of interest to Y'shtola, who presently resides with worshipers of the Dark─the Night's Blessed.</target>
