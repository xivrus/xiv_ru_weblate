        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_000&lt;tab&gt;You must be Azem's familiar. I had a favor to ask of the observers here, but seeing as they all seem awfully preoccupied, perhaps I can ask you instead.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_001&lt;tab&gt;I'm experimenting with crossbreeding different types of plants. I was thrilled when I finally produced a whole new species...right up until the point where they rose up and floated away.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_008&lt;tab&gt;To tell the truth, I never really had a specific use in mind for them. I suppose I'd best start thinking about that... The Bureau of the Architect won't be impressed with my new creation unless it serves a purpose.</target>
