				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_000&lt;tab&gt;You must be Azem's familiar. I had a favor to ask of the observers here, but seeing as they all seem awfully preoccupied, perhaps I can ask you instead.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_001&lt;tab&gt;I'm experimenting with crossbreeding different types of plants. I was thrilled when I finally produced a whole new species...right up until the point where they rose up and floated away.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_003&lt;tab&gt;Thank you. Here, use this aetheric rope to capture say, four of them, and I can hopefully handle the rest.</target>

I suppose I'd best start thinking about that... The Bureau of the Architect won't be impressed with my new creation unless it serves a purpose.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKZH002_04297_STAFF04297_000_009&lt;tab&gt;With that in mind, I believe there's research to be done. Thank you for your help, and do pass on my regards to Azem.</target>
