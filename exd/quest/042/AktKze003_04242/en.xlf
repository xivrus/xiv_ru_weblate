While we were sleeping, Mare Lamentorum has undergone a number of bewildering changes, one of those being the appearance of strange walking fungi─thinkers, we call them.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZE003_04242_RECORDINGWAY_000_003&lt;tab&gt;An Allagan vessel crashed here many years ago, you see, and some part of it pierced through the wall of our underground bioplant. I believe the spores from within eventually made their way to the surface of the moon, where they went on to mutate and evolve in our absence.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="52" approved="yes"><source>52</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZE003_04242_RECORDINGWAY_000_004&lt;tab&gt;I mean to study these curious new life-forms, but I need more data before I can draw any real conclusions.
