He asks that you destroy four of their number to allow at least some passersby to escape unscathed.</target>

However, he cannot rest on his laurels just yet─so as long as the monsters continue to pursue any passing traveler, he must remain ever watchful.</target>

Well, I have─enough to last me a lifetime, in fact. They're making it impossible to travel through Ohl Tahn unmolested. Could you get rid of four of them for me?</target>

I've had just about enough of it, kupo! If you cut down four of them, it'll soon wipe the smiles off their faces!</target>

Those vinegaroons are always chasing after us moogles, snapping their bladed jaws and swinging their bladed tails. If I wasn't here to scare them away, this place would be a few pom-poms short of a picnic!</target>
