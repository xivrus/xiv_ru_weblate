He is dismayed and surprised that so many of Nidhogg's brood have infested Zenith, and is overcome with worry about the two moogles he sent on patrol. After you tell him of what happened to Mogleo, Mogkul resolves to go and aid his comrade-in-arms, and bids you find Mogga and Mogok before one of Nidhogg's brood gives them an unpleasant surprise.</target>
