Go to Eil Tohm and slay the inconsiderate hropken, then fill the empty ewer Mogret gave you with water for the flowers.</target>

If we don't water these flowers soon, there'll be nothing left but dried husks! But thanks to a mean old hropken, doing gods know what in the spring, we can't get anywhere near the precious water!</target>
