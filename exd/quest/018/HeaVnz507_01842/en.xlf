He tells you how the appearance of invasive vilekin is a common occurrence in the Churning Mists, their eggs brought back from the world below in the soil stuck between the claws of returning dragons. The next time such a species appears, Mognell will deal with it himself...provided he can't convince a passing adventurer to do his job for him.</target>

If those eggs hatch, we'll have a problem on our paws! Could you get rid of them for me, kupo?</target>

They're so inconsiderate, kupo!</target>
