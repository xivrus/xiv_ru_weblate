Kal Myhk rouses him and offers him the fish and meat you procured. His brother refuses, and becoming aware of your presence, grows increasingly angry at the offering. He recalls the men who plucked him from the skies of Coerthas, nearly claiming his life. He warns Kal Myhk that no man can be trusted, and claims that you too will soon turn to betray him. Kal Myhk is at a loss for words, and quickly leaves the cave to consider his brother's words. Seek Kal Myhk near Anyx Trine, and see how he is handling this news.</target>
