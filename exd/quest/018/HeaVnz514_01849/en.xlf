        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ514_01849_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The unmaneuvering moogle informs you the heights of Zenith play host to a flock of migratory wildfowl, and this year's chicks have recently flown the roost. While the sight of the young birds setting out on the first leg of their life's long journey is soothing to the soul, the decomposing piles of leaf litter and broken eggshells they leave behind are less welcome. The moogle asks you to scour the heights of Zenith for the fledglings' abandoned nests and bring them back to him.</target>

If you should ever wish to try a hot cup of sticks, feathers, eggshells, and regurgitated worms, then the unmaneuvering moogle is the chef to speak with.</target>

I hope they come back someday, kupo...but until then, we've got a pile of empty nests to deal with.</target>

Will you help me to clear them away, kupo? The birds like to build them in the very highest places, so take care you don't fall!</target>

Just between you and me, I've heard that you can make a tasty soup out of birds' nests. When I get back to Moghome, I'm going to boil them up with a few fresh kupo nuts! ...Do you think I should leave in the half-chewed bug bits or scrape them out?</target>
