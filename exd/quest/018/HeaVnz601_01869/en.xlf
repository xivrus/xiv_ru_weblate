You find a shelf listing volumes one through nine, but volumes four and six seem to be missing. Looking on another shelf you find volume six. You also notice volume ten lying on one of the tables. A young seminarian named Theomocent tells you he is studying volumes twelve and thirteen, while Archombadin tells you of his work with volume fourteen in a condescending tone. The student standing outside, Leigh, tells you he borrowed a volume from the scholasticate, but he has forgotten which one. After speaking with Janchette, however, you learn that Leigh has borrowed volume four but is too busy to study its contents. Report to Mathye and tell him what you have learned.</target>
