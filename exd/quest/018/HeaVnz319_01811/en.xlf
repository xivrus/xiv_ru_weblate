His mind still fuzzy from slumber, he regards you with indifference bordering on distaste. One mention of his brother, however, quickly sends him flying toward the exit. Head back to the indomitable wyvern and see if his younger brother has returned safely.</target>

The indomitable wyvern quickly apologizes, promising his brother will be dealt with in short order.</target>
