She worries that leaving the beast be will only result in more injured dragoons, and bids you slay it before any more come to harm. She also asks that you bring something from that battle that might help identify the true nature of such a dragon. Make your way to the lower layer of the Rookery and slay the dragon if you find it.</target>

It seems the dragon you slew was once a heretic, his monstrous form resulting from overindulging in dragon blood. Maenne cannot understand the heretic's motivations, and wonders why anyone would choose to be transformed in such a way.</target>
