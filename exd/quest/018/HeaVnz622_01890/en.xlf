        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ622_01890_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Margyt has been reviewing the report of the scout who survived the recent dragon attack. Judging by the fang you recovered from its body, the dragon you slew does not match the dragon in the report. Furthermore, many of the soldiers that reportedly fell to the dragon are still unaccounted for. Their bodies have likely been eaten by the beasts that inhabit the mountains. Kill the slate yetis near the site of the attack and recover evidence of the troops' demise, such that their families may have closure.</target>
