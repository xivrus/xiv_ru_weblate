To complete the medicine, he must add a handful or three of blistering scales, freshly sliced from the skin of a Mists biast. The malcontent moogle hands you a Moglinglaive to strip the scales from the lizards' tails, and sends you on your way.</target>

If they're not forthcoming, you can use this Moglinglaive to slice some off─it's so sharp, you can trim their scales without them even noticing! Good luck, kupo!</target>
