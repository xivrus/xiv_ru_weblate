Sorbets do not normally live in this area, and Ingaret is unable to offer any explanation as to why they are there. She does seem to have a hunch─one she chooses not to disclose.</target>

Besides, nobody I tell actually believes me anyway. But I'm sure they were sorbets. I saw them wandering around Red Rim, just south of the Convictory.</target>
