Sorbets do not normally live in this area, and Ingaret is unable to offer any explanation as to why they are there. She does seem to have a hunch─one she chooses not to disclose.</target>

Those things multiply so quickly, so it won't be long before the snowfields are filled with those disgusting creatures. Please kill some of them. Killing four should be enough for now─just to keep their numbers down so they don't get out of hand.</target>
