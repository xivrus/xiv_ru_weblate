She is part of Dominiac's unit, and the troops know that he is up to something─they have not been sent out after the Dravanian Horde in quite some time now. The only option, as Margyt sees it, is to take action of their own accord. Talk to Ayleth for further details.</target>

Killing this beast would help make up for the time wasted waiting for orders from Dominiac. The attack happened at Red Rim, to the south of the Convictory. Rendezvous with Ayleth there.</target>
