Before the Calamity froze the waters, Oakum Landing was frequented by countless ships. In those days, Emont would recycle unneeded or damaged rigging and sell it for other ships to use for repairs or reinforcements. Though the ice and cold have stopped the ships from reaching him, he plans to prepare for the day the rivers melt by having plenty of rigging prepared for sale.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ620_01888_EMONT_000_021&lt;tab&gt;Long ago, I used to recycle rigging and sell it to the ships that passed by here. It may not look it now, but this place was once a bustling hub of activity.</target>
