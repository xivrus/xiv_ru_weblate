It seems that dragons have overrun the flower bed he had been so dutifully caring over, and drove him away when he attempted to impart onto them the flowers' importance. Now, the moogle is trapped at Zenith with no way to return to Asah because the road is blocked by the selfsame dragons that invaded his flower bed. Mogleo, seeing an opportunity to help yet another desperate moogle, volunteers his protection while the heartbroken moogle makes his way home. Speak with Mogleo again, who wants to discuss the battle strategy of this next adventure with you.</target>
