        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ406_01824_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The moogle in Asah has a tragic story to tell. He was in possession of a borrowed knife, made from the razor-sharp spine of a hulking wadjet. For reasons known not even to himself, he brought the knife on a days-long romp around the Churning Mists, at the end of which the knife was nowhere to be found. Unable to face his friend without the knife, he has decided that the only course of action is to make a new one, but he is too scared to get close enough to a pull a spine from one of the dangerous wadjets. Mogleo eagerly volunteers to get a wadjet spine in the moogle's stead, and hurries to the northeast, where the beasts are said to inhabit. Follow Mogleo and speak to him to find out what exactly his plan is.</target>
