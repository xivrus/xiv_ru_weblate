However, not just any moogle can join the revered group of defenders. Only one whose strength is recognized by all can hope to join the elite group, and Mogleo needs your help to show that he has the mettle required to stand among such noble guardians. He plans to prove his strength by helping the many troubled moogles across the land, and promptly leaves in search of the first recipient of his kindness. Meet with Mogleo near Moghome to see if he has found a sufficiently distressed moogle.</target>

Mogleo, eager to make his name as a helper of mooglekind, flits off hurriedly in that direction, bidding that you come as well. Meet with Mogleo to the northeast of Moghome to see if his search has produced aught of value.</target>

You leap to Mogleo's rescue, and the preoccupied moogle barely acknowledges your fierce battle. With the dragon dealt with, speak with Mogleo to find out if his intensive search was productive.</target>
