        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ611_01879_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Maenne's scouts have reported several locations that appear to have been host to ancient battles, and have been tasked with obtaining readings of the sites' aetheric levels. However, the scouts scarce have the time to take accurate readings on account of the dragons stalking the area. Maenne asks you to help the scouts and bids you meet the scouting party near Sothton Walls. Speak with the southern scouting party dragoon to see what he requires.</target>
