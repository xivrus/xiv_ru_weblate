I've been flapping my wings off all day, trying to escape these irritating dragonets. They seem to be fascinated by moogles, and won't stop following me around!</target>

If you were to give the dragon pups a bit of a thrashing, that'd teach them not to harass a poor moogle, kupo!</target>

As cute as moogles are─and we &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;are&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; cute─that doesn't give wild animals the right to just mob around us like a piece of meat, kupo!</target>
