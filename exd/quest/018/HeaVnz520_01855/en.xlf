        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ520_01855_GUIDEMOG01855_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Their numbers just keep growing─there's no choice now but to thin the crowd a bit. If you were to give the dragon pups a bit of a thrashing, that'd teach them not to harass a poor moogle, kupo!</target>

As cute as moogles are─and we &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;are&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; cute─that doesn't give wild animals the right to just mob around us like a piece of meat, kupo!</target>
