After hearing of the moogles' plight, however, he immediately calls for him that you might do away with their attackers. Journey together with Whei Ahf to the Landlord Colony and save the Mogmenders.

※Speak with the dextrous dragonet in Bahrr Lehs to mount Whei Ahf.</target>

An angry bellow from Whei Ahf is all it takes to send them running. The Mogmender thanks you profusely and soon after retreats, most likely back to Bahrr Lehs. Whei Ahf implores you to continue your search for troubled moogles.</target>

The moogle seems surprised to find himself in one piece and flees before that is no longer the case. Your dragon companion still senses danger nearby, and so you press on.</target>

No longer sensing any danger in the area, he suggests returning to Bahrr Lehs and informing Mogek that the dragon threat is no more.</target>
