He further surmises that it is the selfsame Reauverre who stole away with the missing parcel that you recovered. Fearing for the boy's safety, he dashes out for the Ruby Road Exchange in search, and entreats you to join him.</target>

The boy begins to run away, but suddenly collapses. As Reauverre rests in his bed, the registrar reveals that while the boy's illness is not immediately life-threatening, the rarity of a herb required in its treatment has resulted in extending his stay at the ward moons longer than originally anticipated. Notwithstanding this, the boy has always shown admirable courage in facing his sickness, which makes his recent behavior all the more troubling. As the raven-haired registrar laments his inability to help the suffering boy, you cannot help but sympathize with his plight...</target>
