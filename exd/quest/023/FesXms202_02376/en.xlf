        <target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS202_02376_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Upon seeing the remaining present, the registrar explains there is indeed one child who remains unaccounted for: Reauverre, a young boy who presumably slipped out of the children's ward unattended. He further surmises that it is the selfsame Reauverre who stole away with the missing parcel that you recovered. Fearing for the boy's safety, he dashes out for the Ruby Road Exchange in search, and entreats you to join him.</target>

As Reauverre rests in his bed, the registrar reveals that while the boy's illness is not immediately life-threatening, the rarity of a herb required in its treatment has resulted in extending his stay at the ward moons longer than originally anticipated. Notwithstanding this, the boy has always shown admirable courage in facing his sickness, which makes his recent behavior all the more troubling. As the raven-haired registrar laments his inability to help the suffering boy, you cannot help but sympathize with his plight...</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS202_02376_DAMIELLIOT_000_108&lt;tab&gt;Reauverre's illness is not an especially complex one, but one of the herbs used in its treatment is quite rare and not easily come by.

I only want to help him, and yet I am at a complete loss for ideas as to how I might do so. Alas and alack, whatever am I to do!?</target>
