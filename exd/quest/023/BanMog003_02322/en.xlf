However, the moogles are not the only inhabitants of the Churning Mists. Mogzin takes the initiative and suggests that you ask the dragons for help. The moogle even claims that he knows a dragon that can lend its aid, and asks you to wait at the Mogmender outpost while he seeks his friend out.</target>
