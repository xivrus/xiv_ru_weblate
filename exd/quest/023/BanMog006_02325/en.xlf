        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG006_02325_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Although Mogzin would like to begin work immediately, you realize that although you know what the statue stood for, you do not know what it looked like. After mulling over the question for a moment, you come to the conclusion that it likely depicted a scene of man and dragon living in harmony. However, with all such statues having been destroyed years ago, there is nothing to base yours on. Tarresson suggests that maybe the Temple Knights possess something that could be of use, and instructs you to go to the Congregation to ask Ser Handeloup if he can part with a heretical idol. In case the knight is hesitant to fulfill your request, Tarresson gives you a letter which he assures you will convince Ser Handeloup to do so.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG006_02325_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;As Tarresson suspected, Handeloup initially refuses your request, but changes his mind after reading the contents of the letter. In it, Tarresson has written that any figures taken from the Churning Mists should be returned to the moogles, as they have been tasked with taking care of the ancient ruins which dot the region. You ask how Tarresson knows so much about Ishgardian politics, prompting Handeloup to reveal that the humble stonemason was once in fact the count of House Dzemael. The commander agrees that Tarresson's reasoning is sound, and grants you leave to request an idol from his subordinate Vaincannet.</target>

It is then that he formally introduces himself as the former Count de Dzemael, and he confides that the work with the Mogmenders has been an ideal way for him to spend his time since stepping down from the position of count. He returns to the matter of the statue, and tasks you with crafting yet another set of supplies. Mogmul awaits with any materials you require.</target>
