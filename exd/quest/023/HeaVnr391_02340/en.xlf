				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_HEAVNR391_02340_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;For reasons nigh as inscrutable as the convolutions of time and space you experienced inside Alexander, it is as if the power of the minstrel's song has given physical form to your recollections of that final confrontation with the colossus. Whatever the explanation, you know only too well that reflecting upon the past can leave one better equipped to face the future.

※Alexander (Savage) can be accessed by speaking with Lightkix in the Dravanian hinterlands, as well as via the Duty Finder.</target>

'Tis a stirring tale, indeed, and one made more affecting by the unadorned manner in which you tell it. A struggle for the future so grand as to span the boundaries of time and space... Would that I had been there to witness it with mine own eyes!</target>

If I understand correctly, had you triumphed over the giant only for the goblins to reverse the flow of time─thereby compelling you to do battle over and over and over again─the primal's power would have grown to nigh-infinite proportions.</target>

N-Not that I want for inspiration, of course! Your tale is more than sufficient! Why, even now my muse stirs within me! Hearken unto her song!</target>

Whose hunger for aether spelled death for the land.♪
And thus did our hero swear never to cease,♪
Till &lt;var 08 E905 ((she'd)) ((he'd)) /var&gt; torn out the heart of the great metal beast.♪
Yet for all of &lt;var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var&gt; labors, both bruising and brave,♪
The goblins stood poised to make hist'ry their slave.♪

And plucked from the goblins their dream of a home,♪
For it saw but one way to set hist'ry aright,♪
A champion of ages, a hero of light.♪
So the giant now sleeps, as it did once before,♪
In a moment repeated, forever and more.♪</target>
