				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANMOG402_02303_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You are greeted by a moogle who is all smiles, telling you a deal was made just moments before your arrival. If only the dragons had interest in what was offered. Rather than the cloud mallow or kupo nuts one would expect of moogles, they demanded a number of gratuitous items that only one of your expertise could hope to craft. Supplied with materials, the moogle representative implores you to fulfill the dragons' request.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the mediating moogle.</target>
