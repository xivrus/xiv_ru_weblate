Alphinaud, however, lingers for a moment, crouching over the now empty crate with a puzzled expression on his face. Rising at length, he states that the container once bore Ishgardian seals, which someone took great pains to remove. Reasoning that the kobolds would not journey to Aldenard to obtain crystals, much less bother with such precautions, he deduces that the crate must have been smuggled out of Ishgard and transported across the sea─likely at the behest of the Ascians. Alas, there is no time to dwell on the implications of this discovery as the third cache of crystals awaits.</target>

A thorough survey of the area serves to confirm your suspicions: the crystals have been moved. Alphinaud can only assume that they are now deep within O'Ghomoro, at the site of the summoning ritual. That being the case, you have no recourse but to breach the Navel once more and seize the remaining crystals by force. Before you launch your attack, however, Alphinaud insists that you hand over the crystals in your pack, reasoning that it would be reckless to take them with you into the enemy's midst.</target>

Ga Bu duly demands to see his parents, but realizes to his horror that you have arrived too late, and that they and the other prisoners have already been executed. Even as Alphinaud makes a final attempt to reason with the patriarch, the kobold child cries out over and over again for his parents to wake up, his wailing filling the chamber, growing louder, more intense─and then, as if in answer, the gathered crystals begin to glow. Moments later, the aether begins to coalesce, dragging the rocks towards a single point, until the Lord of Crags stands before you in all his terrible fury. With a mixture of joy and confusion, the kobolds look on their Great Father, who fixes them with his burning gaze...before casting them from the platform in a fit of rage. You and Alisaie move to defend the distraught Ga Bu while Alphinaud conjures a Carbuncle to distract the raging primal, and as Titan claws at his face, the four of you make your escape.</target>

While summoned with far fewer crystals than intended, the Titan born of the child's anguish is nevertheless a threat which cannot be ignored, for he will only grow stronger as he draws aether from the land. And so it falls to you to return to the Navel, and there put the rampaging avatar of grief out of its misery.
