While he and Ohl Deeh gather information about Gullinbursti's current whereabouts, you and the deftarm will pursue the mysterious masked assailant in hopes of gaining insight as to what precisely is afflicting the ancient dragon, and how he might be returned to his benevolent self. At the deftarm's suggestion, you split up to question the residents of Bahrr Lehs regarding aught they may have seen or heard.</target>

The full implications of this remain a mystery, but mayhap the deftarm has gleaned some new information that will serve to shed light on the whole affair.</target>

Your loyal apprentice bears troubling news, however, as he relates that the assailants set upon the girl with a cruel, crazed savagery entirely uncharacteristic of the highly regimented Gnath. When Drydox then reveals that she heard gunshots shortly prior to the attack, the deftarm makes the obvious connection: the masked man responsible for Gullinbursti's madness is surely close at hand. Identifying his destination as the forest, you plot a course for Tailfeather to consult with the hunter Marcechamp.</target>

When the deftarm restates his resolve, undeterred by these grave warnings, the hunter relents and shares his knowledge of your quarry's whereabouts. Promising your determined pupil that you will only intercede if absolutely necessary, together you strike out for the Convictory in the western highlands of Coerthas.</target>
