        <target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY301_02399_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;A reporter from the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Mythril Eye&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; stops you by saying he would like to ask you a few questions for an article he will be running on Little Ladies' Day. He begins by inquiring if you have ever heard of the trio of preteen troubadours, the Songbirds, who are scheduled to perform at the festival. As he continues to question you, however, it soon becomes evident that the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Mythril Eye&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; representative's intentions are not quite what he claims them to be. Telling you an ardent group of the Songbirds' fans─the Birdwatchers─have been stirring up some trouble, he then attempts to recruit you on behalf of the royal seneschal who seems to have found himself on the receiving end of their mischief. While unable to tell you much more, the reporter then points you in the direction of Emerald Avenue where the Birdwatchers are gathered.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

He is quick to pick you out from the rest of the angry mob and motions in your direction. Immensely relieved that backup has arrived, he asks that you meet him at the Wellhead Lift so that you might exchange a few words in private.</target>
