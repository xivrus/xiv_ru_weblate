        <target state="final">TEXT_CHREND301_02361_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Ulaa's safe return has brought with it the revival of a certain vicious rumor. Once more, the seminarians whisper amongst themselves, accusing Archombadin of arranging the girl's kidnapping, and this time they are resolved to take justice into their own hands. When the headmistress calls for an emergency meeting, the student body takes full advantage of the lack of supervision and moves to call for Archombadin's removal from the scholasticate. Asking that you look into matters on his behalf, Briardien leaves you with Blaisie to pursue his own line of investigation.</target>

One youth is particularly vocal about seeing the prefect removed, and his frenzied shouts are quick to incite the other students gathered around. Her own efforts to do so having already failed, Blaisie asks you to attempt to ease the mounting tension. Perhaps you should start by trying to /soothe the stern seminarian.</target>

I cannot help but believe, however, that he, too, is a victim in all this. I strain to think that anyone who cares so deeply about the scholasticate and its inhabitants could commit such an atrocity.</target>
