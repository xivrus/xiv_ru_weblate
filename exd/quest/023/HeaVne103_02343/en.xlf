While the House Fortemps knights return to Camp Dragonhead and prepare a report, he would head for the Congregation both to brief Ser Aymeric and to see if his sister's condition has at all improved.</target>

There, Alphinaud is relieved to find that his sister has regained consciousness and is well on her way to a full recovery. Per Y'shtola's request, you proceed to give your account of all that occurred in Xelphatol, prompting a debate as to the credibility of the Warrior of Darkness's claims. When all have had their say, however, the Scions agree only that their foes' attempts to spur the beast tribes to summon ever stronger primals cannot be allowed to continue.

Thancred then reveals that he and Alisaie have uncovered evidence suggesting that the Ascians are behind a plot to furnish several beast tribes with a steady stream of crystals. On the understanding that severing their supply lines would do much to slow the escalation, it is decided that the others─Ser Aymeric included─will attempt to determine the Ixal and the Gnath's source. You and Alphinaud, meanwhile, will visit Urianger to find out if his wealth of knowledge concerning primal beings might be put to good use. When Alisaie subsequently insists that she be allowed to accompany you, Alphinaud seems poised to refuse her, only to relent in the face of her steely-eyed determination. All that remains is to wait for her to finish changing into her new outfit─yet another original creation of Tataru's fecund imagination.</target>
