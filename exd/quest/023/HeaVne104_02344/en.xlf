Of more immediate concern, however, is the fact that one of the beastmen may be skulking about the camp, possibly with designs on the crystal store. Perhaps with the aid of Alphinaud and Alisaie, you can sniff out this mysterious infiltrator.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Though Alphinaud readily acknowledges that the kobolds' recent behavior does suggest that a summoning is imminent, he finds it odd that a single kobold would wander so close to a Maelstrom camp and risk drawing attention to the efforts of his brethren. Nevertheless, the beastman's presence presents a valuable opportunity to learn more of the kobolds' plans─providing he can be taken alive, of course.</target>

Joined by Alphinaud, Alisaie, and Commander Bloeidin, you listen as he introduces himself as Ga Bu of the 620th Order. The young child then reveals his reason for coming to Camp Overlook: to beseech the Maelstrom to stop the patriarch from summoning Great Father Titan. Ga Bu goes on to explain that his parents, along with other like-minded kobolds, spoke out against the patriarch's plans, only to be taken away to serve as “coke for the furnace.” This ominous turn of phrase prompts Alisaie to recall tales of beastmen fashioning ritual foci from the bones of their brethren as a means to summon more powerful incarnations of their gods. Fearing the worst, Alphinaud instructs the commander to inform Maelstrom Command that Titan's return may be imminent, and declares that the Scions will attempt to infiltrate the kobold stronghold, secure the crystals, and free the prisoners.</target>

Regardless, you must do all you can to stop the patriarch's plans, and for that you will need to enlist the help of the brave young kobold before you.</target>
