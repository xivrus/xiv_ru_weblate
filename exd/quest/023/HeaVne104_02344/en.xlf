Of more immediate concern, however, is the fact that one of the beastmen may be skulking about the camp, possibly with designs on the crystal store.

Joined by Alphinaud, Alisaie, and Commander Bloeidin, you listen as he introduces himself as Ga Bu of the 620th Order. The young child then reveals his reason for coming to Camp Overlook: to beseech the Maelstrom to stop the patriarch from summoning Great Father Titan. Ga Bu goes on to explain that his parents, along with other like-minded kobolds, spoke out against the patriarch's plans, only to be taken away to serve as “coke for the furnace.” This ominous turn of phrase prompts Alisaie to recall tales of beastmen fashioning ritual foci from the bones of their brethren as a means to summon more powerful incarnations of their gods. Fearing the worst, Alphinaud instructs the commander to inform Maelstrom Command that Titan's return may be imminent, and declares that the Scions will attempt to infiltrate the kobold stronghold, secure the crystals, and free the prisoners.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="7" approved="yes"><source>7</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNE104_02344_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;Lowering his voice, Alphinaud confesses that although he is confident the primal has yet to be summoned, it may yet be too late to save Ga Bu's parents and the other prisoners.
