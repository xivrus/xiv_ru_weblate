In the next moment, a breathless Krile appears and announces that Y'shtola and Urianger have engaged an unknown band of assailants. You hurry to the scene of the conflict to find a trio of strangers whom you determine to be thralls of the eikon Sophia. Though they do not linger long, they leave you with the words of an ominous prophecy, and the fear that their mistress may have already awoken in possession of all her terrible might. Time is of the essence. Summon your faithful comrades to your side and cast down the dread Goddess lest all be judged upon her scales!

According to their investigation, the eikon enslaved the will of a careless Garlean soldier and commanded him to release her thralls. Allagan records also speak of a failed plot to exploit a flaw introduced into the machinery of Sophia's prison─a scheme that came dangerously close to being enacted millennia later. Even as you make your way back to the Rising Stones and Unukalhai, you are haunted by the thought of what might have come to pass had the Goddess been suffered to escape her fetters.</target>

Regula van Hydrus rose to the top of the Garlean military on merit alone, and is fiercely loyal to the Emperor for recognizing his efforts. His compeers, by contrast, rose through the favor of the established order, and would accordingly do anything to see him fail.</target>
