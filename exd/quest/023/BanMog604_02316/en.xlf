Upon the initial count of supplies, they noticed there were a couple of elements that had been forgotten in the order sent to Ishgard, and entrusts to your craftsmanship skills to make before the ingredients spoil. Go to Asah to request materials from Mogwon without giving away the surprise.</target>
