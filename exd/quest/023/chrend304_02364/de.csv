All clues point to Lebrassoir de Bonfaurt being the culprit, but without evidence to support your suspicions, there is no way to absolve Archombadin of his perceived guilt. When all seems lost, Theomocent steps forth with a plan as to how he might obtain a confession from your suspect.

Funneling a portion of the Dzemael heir's inheritance towards financing Ulaa's kidnapping, he then stirred up the rumors that Archombadin was to blame, and distributed the letters to strike the proverbial final blow. Though you may have finally ascertained the truth, the hour of the hearing which will determine Archombadin's fate is at hand, and Theomocent fears that events might take a further twist.

"","TEXT_CHREND304_02364_SEQ_03<tab>Soon after Lebrassoir confesses to his crimes before the deacon and Father Saturnois, Briardien bursts in with Temple Knight guards at either side. Pointing his finger at the scholasticate priest, he tells you that it was Saturnois who manipulated Lebrassoir into carrying out his schemes and that he is not the man he claims to be. Having suffered for years isolated from the outside world, and forced to work for Her Holy Body of Decency as a watchman consigned to monitor the expurgators─a terrible fate reserved solely for orphans who graduate from the scholasticate and enter the Holy See─he had intended to create a scandal so large, the outrage it would spark in the community would force the scholasticate into closure. He believed the establishment's demise would right some of the wrongs committed against him and others like him. While Archombadin's name has been cleared and it is clear he will not be expelled, Saturnois' revelation causes the deacon to question if the school itself should remain open. At the behest of the students, however, she instead holds a public hearing and divulges to the people of Ishgard the terrible tragedy suffered by both expurgator and watchman. Having turned over a new leaf by speaking the truth, the residents of the scholasticate are hopeful that it will rekindle the people's faith in their institution.","TEXT_CHREND304_02364_SEQ_03<tab>Lebrassoir gesteht seine Schuld, doch Saturnois will sich seltsamerweise nicht damit zufriedengeben und fordert eine Schließung des Theologikums. Da taucht Briardien auf und enthüllt, dass Saturnois gar kein echter Priester sei. So konfrontiert, gesteht dieser, dass tatsächlich er es war, der hinter allem steckte. Er hat Lebrassoir zu seiner Tat angestiftet und Zwietracht unter den Studenten gesät. Der Grund dafür liegt in seiner Ver<var 16 /var>gangen<var 16 /var>heit: Ursprünglich eine Waise, stieg er zum Jahrgangsbesten des Theologikums auf und wurde in eine geheime Abteilung der Kurie aufgenommen. Dort diente er als eine Art Kerkermeister, der die sogenannten „Boten“ bewachte, Waisen aus dem Theologikum, die nur zu dem Zweck gefangen gehalten wurden, um im Falle eines Papstwechsels dem neuen Papst die bittere Wahrheit über Ishgards Geschichte zu übermitteln. Saturnois' Freund, von dem er einmal erzählte, war so ein Bote, der sein Los nicht mehr ertrug und sich das Leben nahm. Saturnois wollte sich an der Kirche für seinen Tod rächen und das Theologikum schließen lassen.<br>Nicht einmal Dekanin Elviane hatte von diesem grausamen System der Überlieferung gewusst und erwägt eine Unterrichtspause. Doch auf Theomocents Forderung hin wird diese Wahrheit allen Bürgern offengelegt - vielleicht der erste Schritt zu einer erneuerten, auf Vertrauen und Offenheit gegründeten Kirche.
