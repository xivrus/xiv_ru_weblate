        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNY816_02393_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;No sooner do you look in his direction than an Auri monk cowers away from you, begging for mercy. His fear soon gives way to relief after realizing you did not come to knock him on his backside. As he explains it, the Maelstrom has opened an arena where adventurers may freely challenge comrades-in-arms to combat. What has the Auri fighter so concerned, however, is that because these battles are not confined to the Pit of the Wolves' Den, he has been constantly harassed by strangers looking to pick a fight. Judging by the air of confidence about you, he suggests you pay a visit to the officer down on the docks, that you might learn more about this new fighting ring.</target>

Before you rush headlong into the arena, however, she intends to explain the protocols one must follow when dueling on the Wolves' Den Pier.</target>
