        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL402_02381_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You speak with Angelet, who makes a seemingly innocent request─with her magicked cloth in hand, she asks you to relive the fiercest battles of your past. The only condition, however, is that you do so at the scene of battle, as that is the only way to quicken the magicks of her fabric. Though the locales she insists upon are likely still teeming with danger, you are not one to balk at a challenge. And so you make haste to the sites of your past adventures.

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL402_02381_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Your stroll down memory lane was fraught with peril, but both you and Angelet's magicked cloth remain none the worse for wear, and surprisingly no different. Which seems peculiar since, according to Angelet, there should be some discernible difference in the cloth. Perhaps she can explain what, if any, change has taken place.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL402_02381_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Angelet is beaming with excitement upon your return, and the reason for her elation gives you pause. As she explains it, her profession is the crafting of dolls using cursed materials. What was once an ostensibly normal bolt of fabric is now replete with the pain and suffering of your fallen enemies. As promised, she bequeaths to you the singing cluster you desire. In the event you cross paths with her again, you remind yourself not to ask after her merchandise.

Upon completing the quest, it will become available again the following day at &lt;var 06 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 08 DB ((&lt;var 09 DB02030405060708090A0B0C0D02030405060708090A0B0C /var&gt;)) 0D /var&gt; &lt;var 08 E0DB0D ((p.m.)) ((a.m.)) /var&gt; (Earth time).</target>
