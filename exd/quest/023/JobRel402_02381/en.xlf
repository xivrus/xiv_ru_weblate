The only condition, however, is that you do so at the scene of battle, as that is the only way to quicken the magicks of her fabric. Though the locales she insists upon are likely still teeming with danger, you are not one to balk at a challenge. And so you make haste to the sites of your past adventures.

Which seems peculiar since, according to Angelet, there should be some discernible difference in the cloth. Perhaps she can explain what, if any, change has taken place.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL402_02381_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Angelet is beaming with excitement upon your return, and the reason for her elation gives you pause. As she explains it, her profession is the crafting of dolls using cursed materials. What was once an ostensibly normal bolt of fabric is now replete with the pain and suffering of your fallen enemies. As promised, she bequeaths to you the singing cluster you desire. In the event you cross paths with her again, you remind yourself not to ask after her merchandise.
