He goes on to recall how Yda once played an active role in the Resistance...until she vanished one day, leaving him fearing the worst. Though plainly startled, Yda musters an apology, explaining that her involvement with the Circle of Knowing and its successor, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, necessitated absolute secrecy.
