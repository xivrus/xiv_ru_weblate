As you all prepare to return to the Rising Stones, you are accosted by Gundobald, who is apparently acquainted with both Yda and her father, with whom he fought in the revolution against the King of Ruin twenty years ago. He goes on to recall how Yda once played an active role in the Resistance...until she vanished one day, leaving him fearing the worst. Though plainly startled, Yda musters an apology, explaining that her involvement with the Circle of Knowing and its successor, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, necessitated absolute secrecy.

With thoughts now turning to the future, Krile and Alisaie are welcomed as a fully fledged Scions, though the latter accepts the honor with rather less enthusiasm than the former.
