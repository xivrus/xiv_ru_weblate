You will only receive the singing clusters upon completing and presenting to her three deftly written tales of daring and adventure. Being no stranger to danger, and knowing where to find it, you set out to find inspiration for your writing.

It takes you no time at all to compose your first masterpiece, but your work is not yet complete. To that end, you set out in search for your next story.

Your second story is complete. With only one tale of adventure left to write, you make haste to another place that danger might call home.

With a flourish of your pen you write what could only be your magnum opus, completing the set of three stories promised to Amphelice. Heading to Idyllshire, you wonder if she will consider your work worthy of the singing clusters.</target>

More than impressed with your work, she explains that she is a writer sorely in need of new ideas for her poetry. Or rather, she was in need of new ideas. Your stories have set her mind to racing, and she is only too happy to reward you with singing clusters.
