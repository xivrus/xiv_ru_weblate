As surprising a sleeping dragon is risky business, he has conceived an unconventional plan to make the dozing Dravanians sneeze themselves awake by showering them with the fluff of a cloud mallow. Speak with the moogle in charge of dispensing the cloud mallows to obtain one for the task at hand.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
