He proceeds to explain that this data will enable Azys Lla's miraculous reality augmentation technologies to generate an idealized simulacrum of the Goddess against whom to test your skills─just as the champions of Allag once did. Take the tomestone to the Flagship, and present the recording device to the verification node.</target>

Assemble a band of trusty companions, and meet the Goddess in all her terrible glory!
