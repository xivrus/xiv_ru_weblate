Mogek is curious to know what has them so on edge, and having already tried and failed several times to eavesdrop on their conversation, he asks that you go and attempt to uncover whatever secrets they may be hiding.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG304_02301_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Upon speaking with Hildeth you learn that the Ishgardian knights are planning to pull a prank of their own on the moogles to further cultivate their friendship. However, seeing as they are unable to fit their smoke bomb into the fake kupo nut they prepared, they are worried that all their scheming and hard work may never come to fruition. Help them synthesize a high-quality exploding kupo nut, and deliver it to the Temple Knight sapper in the Landlord Colony.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Hildeth.</target>
