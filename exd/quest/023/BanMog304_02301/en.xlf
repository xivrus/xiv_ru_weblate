Mogek the Marvelous is staring intently at a group of Ishgardian knights.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG304_02301_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;A band of Temple Knights have gathered in a tight circle just beyond Bahrr Lehs, an apprehensive air about them as they whisper to one another in hushed tones. Mogek is curious to know what has them so on edge, and having already tried and failed several times to eavesdrop on their conversation, he asks that you go and attempt to uncover whatever secrets they may be hiding.

However, seeing as they are unable to fit their smoke bomb into the fake kupo nut they prepared, they are worried that all their scheming and hard work may never come to fruition. Help them synthesize a high-quality exploding kupo nut, and deliver it to the Temple Knight sapper in the Landlord Colony.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Hildeth.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG304_02301_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You deliver the fake kupo nut to the Temple Knight sapper, who gingerly sets it down in an area where unsuspecting moogles are most likely to come across it.
