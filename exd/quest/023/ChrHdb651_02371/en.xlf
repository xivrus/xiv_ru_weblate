The future of House Manderville is in peril! Gigi, apple of my eye, beloved son, has run away with the Grand Sers, those elderly scoundrels! Glad though I was to see him regain his lost memories, his sudden revelations led him to pursue a most dangerous path. Overcome with grief for his deceased creator, he now seeks to harness his phenomenal powers that he might return the dead to life! Yet I know full well he will not find solace in the dark arts, and so it falls to me, Zombibrand, devourer of brains, undead overlord extraordinaire─ Ahem! Former undead overlord, to return my dear boy to the strait and narrow!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
Cyr's forays into the inquisition's archives of forbidden tomes have led him to conclude that Gigi's mysterious abilities are rooted in ancient Allagan traditions. The mammet may indeed have the power to raise the dead, after a fashion, but Cyr believes that at best the resulting entity would be a soulless husk. In any event, he would like to pay a visit to the former residence of Archmagus Quan, the mammet's long-dead creator─but before you can depart together, he is confronted by another inquisitor who claims he committed heresy in the course of his investigation. The young man's accusations spur Cyr to erupt in a righteous fury in which he finds himself denouncing the inquisition he once pledged to serve. After the faint-hearted inquisitor flees to summon the guard, Cyr observes that it would be prudent to flee Ishgard with all due haste, and bids you accompany him to Idyllshire.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB651_02371_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You arrive too late to catch Inspector Hildibrand, who has resumed his pursuit of the Grand Sers.

Joined by Godbert and Cyr, you listen as Hildibrand explains that, after catching up to his quarry, he attempted to reason with the Grand Sers, but instead was rather unceremoniously disposed of by the trio. Cyr is dismayed to learn that the Grand Sers have not only regained their youth, but that Gigi's eyes have taken on a notably pointy disposition, strongly suggesting that the mammet has been overexerting itself. Should he continue to do so, he may completely expend his aether. However, the most shocking revelation comes afterwards, when Hildibrand reveals that the Grand Sers intend to slay none other than Nidhogg! That is, until you quietly remind him of certain momentous events in which you personally took part, prompting the inspector to correct himself and state that Hraesvelgr is their intended target.
