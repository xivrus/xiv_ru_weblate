        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG502_02308_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Mogek tells you that with the growing number of enterprises the Mogmenders are taking on, the demand for more crystals for crafting is growing along with it. A moogle from Moghome offered his assistance in gathering the extra crystals, and while Mogek is grateful to accept any help he can get, he mentions that the moogle has no experience whatsoever. He asks you as an expert to meet with a mirthful moogle atop Sohm Al, who is waiting patiently.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
