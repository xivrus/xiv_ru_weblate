A moogle from Moghome offered his assistance in gathering the extra crystals, and while Mogek is grateful to accept any help he can get, he mentions that the moogle has no experience whatsoever. He asks you as an expert to meet with a mirthful moogle atop Sohm Al, who is waiting patiently.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

You see, the more enterprises the Mogmenders take on, the more crystals we must stockpile for crafting.
