				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANALL140_02385_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Despite recent disheartening developments, the deftarm is determined to forge forward in his quest. Putting on his bravest face, he boldly states his intention to strike out for Azys Lla, going as far as to challenge Ohl Deeh to a race to the floating isle. You follow in pursuit, knowing that your presence will undoubtedly be needed to ensure that the two do not end up biting off more than they can chew.</target>

Vowing to get his revenge in a few short centuries, he quickly puts the minor disgrace behind him and declares that he will use his influence to glean information regarding Gullinbursti's whereabouts. With a healthy degree of skepticism as to how successful this approach will be, you set off after him.</target>

In response to his query, you mention the name of Tiamat, and the impertinent dragonet is all too eager to cast any semblance of tact and decency to the wind in interrupting the ancient dragon's eternal suffering to inquire as to his friend's whereabouts. Somewhat reluctantly, you go along, hoping that your presence will keep Ohl Deeh from saying anything overly stupid.</target>

With Ohl Deeh and the deftarm at your side, you set off to the northeast, where the young dragonet hopes to summon a mighty roar that will reach his friend's ears and heart.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANALL140_02385_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;In the Beta Quadrant, you come upon an incapacitated Gullinbursti being watched over by the nefarious Nhaza'a Jaab and his client, a low-ranking imperial officer by the name of Drusus mal Soranus, who─it is revealed─has furnished the mercenary with the Allagan devices he has employed to wreak his particular brand of havoc. The peevish Drusus summarily orders his hired gun to eliminate the intruders─namely, you and your friends─but Nhaza'a Jaab coolly refuses, and instead sics Gullinbursti on his employer, reducing him to a charred husk. The masked Miqo'te then sets Gullinbursti on the deftarm, but a well-timed appearance by Mogzin's mannequin distracts the dragon, affording Ohl Deeh enough time to unleash a roar far mightier than any would expect from his tiny frame─a roar which breaks the spell over Gullinbursti, at long last restoring him to his gentle self. Nhaza'a Jaab draws his gun and takes aim, but is swiftly disarmed by a timely shot from the deftarm, who is all too eager to return the favor from their encounter at Voor Sian Siran. The mercenary attempts to retreat, but is headed off by Linu Vali and her fellow Gundu, who had made the momentous decision to flaunt tradition to stand by your side in this final confrontation. Nhaza'a Jaab manages to frantically escape to his manacutter and appears to have gotten away, when another unerring shot from the deftarm strikes true, sending the vessel hurtling down through the clouds. Your job complete, you and your friends are free to return home, with a promise to sojourn in Ok' Gundu Nakki on the way, that you might celebrate your triumph this day.</target>

The motions prove so infectious that all present are soon moving as one, and together you dance the night away. Through your efforts, dragon, man, moogle, Vath, and Vanu Vanu alike stand in staunch solidarity, and the hearts of all are filled with hope that the bonds forged this day will continue to bear fruit for years to come.</target>
