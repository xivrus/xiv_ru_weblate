Gather around Tarresson to hear the master Mogmender's thoughts on the matter.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;To Mogzin, it is obvious that the ancient dragon was dissatisfied, and he is determined to find out the reason. You contemplate the possibilities, and realize that none of you know why Gullinbursti demanded the statue be rebuilt in the first place. Sensing that understanding his motives might provide understanding of his discontent, you decide to find out more about him. Ohl Deeh offers to ask the dragon Vedrfolnir what he knows, and you and Mogzin depart for Anyx Trine to ask Vidofnir the same.</target>

She tells you that in the chaos following Ratatoskr's murder, the plaza was destroyed to sate the dragons' thirst for vengeance, and hints that the answer to your questions might be found in its ruins. Luckily, Mogzin remembers that piles of rubble still remain from when the Mogmenders cleared the plaza. Certain that something of use will be found among the stones, Mogzin returns to the Mogmender camp.</target>

They spell out a declaration of friendship between the three original architects of Bahrr Lehs: Marinche de Faurechort, Moggon, and Gullinbursti. It then becomes clear that this was the missing piece, and its absence was what caused Gullinbursti's cool reception to the statue.

Once again, Gullinbursti descends upon Bahrr Lehs, and all present wait in trepidation for his judgment. To your relief, the dragon exclaims his approval, and gives you his thanks for your efforts. Before departing, Gullinbursti pledges to keep the skies of Bahrr Lehs safe. With their massive undertaking finally complete, everyone in the plaza is overcome with joy.
