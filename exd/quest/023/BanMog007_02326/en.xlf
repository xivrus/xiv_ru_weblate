Gather around Tarresson to hear the master Mogmender's thoughts on the matter.

You contemplate the possibilities, and realize that none of you know why Gullinbursti demanded the statue be rebuilt in the first place. Sensing that understanding his motives might provide understanding of his discontent, you decide to find out more about him. Ohl Deeh offers to ask the dragon Vedrfolnir what he knows, and you and Mogzin depart for Anyx Trine to ask Vidofnir the same.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The great white dragon reveals that Gullinbursti helped build the original Bahrr Lehs more than a thousand years past. She tells you that in the chaos following Ratatoskr's murder, the plaza was destroyed to sate the dragons' thirst for vengeance, and hints that the answer to your questions might be found in its ruins. Luckily, Mogzin remembers that piles of rubble still remain from when the Mogmenders cleared the plaza. Certain that something of use will be found among the stones, Mogzin returns to the Mogmender camp.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;You arrive to find Tarresson and Ohl Deeh already sifting through the rubble─evidently the two ancient dragons shared very similar stories.

They spell out a declaration of friendship between the three original architects of Bahrr Lehs: Marinche de Faurechort, Moggon, and Gullinbursti. It then becomes clear that this was the missing piece, and its absence was what caused Gullinbursti's cool reception to the statue. Mogzin decides to begin restoring the tablet at once, and implores you and the others to lend what assistance you can.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="7" approved="yes"><source>7</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG007_02326_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;The master Mogmender requests your aid for what might be the last time.

Once again, Gullinbursti descends upon Bahrr Lehs, and all present wait in trepidation for his judgment. To your relief, the dragon exclaims his approval, and gives you his thanks for your efforts. Before departing, Gullinbursti pledges to keep the skies of Bahrr Lehs safe. With their massive undertaking finally complete, everyone in the plaza is overcome with joy.
