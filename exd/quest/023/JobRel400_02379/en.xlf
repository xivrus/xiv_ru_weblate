        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL400_02379_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Ardashir is seemingly satisfied with the results of his research thus far─so much so, that he soon plans to return to Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han where he will present his findings. Gerolt, on the other hand, is baffled by this presumption, and wastes no time reprimanding him. Ardashir reluctantly accepts the truth─that their work is not yet complete─and soon offers a means to temporarily fortify the anima weapon. For his plan to work, however, it requires a ceruleum solution which he has commissioned from a skilled distiller in Idyllshire. While he begins other preparations for the anima weapon, he asks you to meet with this artisan, one Blamprest, in Idyllshire.

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL400_02379_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Blamprest assures you work on Ardashir's order is well underway. He has been delayed, however, by a need for singing clusters. Though difficult to acquire, he has entrusted the task to a pair of sisters─skilled mages who agreed to help...for a price. No sooner does he mention the pair than they appear before you seeking compensation for their work. Much to your surprise─and dismay─he tells them that you have eagerly agreed to pay for them in his stead. They have yet to explain how you must pay them, but as your only alternative is to bargain at Rowena's Center for Cultural Promotion, you steel yourself to undertake trials of unknown peril.</target>

With your work complete and the elixir in hand, he bids you safe travels back to Azys Lla.</target>

When you explain to him it was an order for spirits placed by Gerolt, he then comes to a sudden and startling realization─Gerolt squandered a portion of the money lent to them by Rowena to make the purchase. Though he is furious, he cannot deny the strange yet beneficial effects of alcohol on Gerolt's work. After regaining his composure, he completes his potion, and sets Gerolt to work on fortifying the anima weapon. Much to their delight, Ardashir's plan was a success. Moreover, he goes on to show you an Allagan droid that may be the key to ensuring the anima's longevity, assuming it can be repaired.

※ The attributes of the anima weapon can be reallocated by speaking with Ulan in Idyllshire.</target>
