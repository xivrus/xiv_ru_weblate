His anxiety about traveling to unfamiliar environs tempered the knowledge that you have friends among the Vanu Vanu who call this place home, your ever-enthusiastic pupil dashes off to hop aboard a kongamato. You can only hope that the deftarm's overeagerness will not be his downfall.</target>

The Vanu Vanu soon releases his quarry with a flurry of apologies, however, upon hearing that his would-be meal is in fact your fast friend and pupil. Linu Vanu can offer no news on the man you seek, but does share his concern that his sister Linu Vali has not returned since leaving the village to perfect a new dance. Concerned that she may come to harm if the masked marauder is roaming the area, you and the deftarm set out in search.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANALL130_02384_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You find Linu Vali, and are relieved to see that she has come to no harm, but was merely seeking inspiration for her new dance in the idyllic climes of Voor Sian Siran. She laments, however, that her new dance has not taken form quite as she hoped it would. Turning to you for inspiration, she asks that you perform for her a dance the likes of which neither her kind nor yours has ever seen. Might you perchance have some movements in your repertoire that would serve to stir her creative juices?</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANALL130_02384_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;You dance the dance of the moogles for Linu Vali, who is most taken with these endearing and unworldly undulations, joyfully proclaiming that she has found her long-sought inspiration. Unfamiliar with the importance of dance in Vanu Vanu culture, the deftarm is less than impressed, derisively insisting that flailing about will not avail you in the matter at hand: to wit, the pursuit of the masked villain you seek. Your pupil is quickly silenced when, against all odds, you spot a suspicious personage enjoying a leisurely bath in a nearby pool. The masked man introduces himself as Nhaza'a Jaab, and you soon surmise that this is none other than the ruthless villain behind Gullinbursti's sudden turn to madness. Your brave-if-foolhardy pupil steps forth to confront the masked Miqo'te and gleans some gainful information in the process: namely, that the man is in the service of an imperial agent, and possesses a firearm with the power to rob dragons and beastmen of their free will. The confrontation is brief, however, as the ruthless rogue treacherously disarms the deftarm. Wielding his weapon against a trio of unwitting Gundu warriors who arrive on the scene, he turns them against you and takes advantage of the ensuing chaos to make a discreet retreat. When Linu Vali's sundrop dance fails to subdue the ensorcelled Gundu, she asks you to join her in performing the dance she devised with your inspiration. The moonlift dance─as Linu Vali dubs it─shakes the very earth, and the Gundu return to their senses as they back away, ashamed at their actions. All present breathe a sigh of relief, although the deftarm is clearly disheartened that the dance he so mocked proved more powerful than did he. Perhaps a word from you might serve to lift your pupil's spirits.</target>

You, the deftarm, and Ohl Deeh resolve to pursue him northeast to Azys Lla, but not all of your friends will be following you. For while Linu Vali desires to join you, she is forbidden by Vanu tradition from setting foot in that baneful land. Meanwhile, Master Mogzin seems to have suffered a sudden crisis of confidence, insisting that he has naught to offer you in the battle to come. Ignoring the heated pleas of the deftarm and Ohl Deeh, he shrinks off back to Moghome with his tail between his legs...</target>
