After observing that their current tools were unfit for a moogle's small paws, he surmised that wind-aspected tools might be more suitable for the flying folk. Before he produces tools for all the Mogmenders, however, he requires a sample to base the rest on. He enlists your aid in producing a special moogle hammer, and instructs you to bring the crate to Mogmul before beginning your work.</target>

Tarresson then informs Mogzin of the gift you both made, and although the moogle is wary at first, he eventually accepts. With hammer in hand, Mogzin remarks that the difference between this tool and the old ones is like night and day. It would seem Tarresson's intuition was correct, and with these tools the Mogmenders can forge further ahead on the path to mastery.</target>
