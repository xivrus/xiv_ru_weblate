Worried that the crates will be too heavy for the moogle to carry back alone, Tarresson asks you to follow him and assist in the recovery.</target>

After observing that their current tools were unfit for a moogle's small paws, he surmised that wind-aspected tools might be more suitable for the flying folk. Before he produces tools for all the Mogmenders, however, he requires a sample to base the rest on. He enlists your aid in producing a special moogle hammer, and instructs you to bring the crate to Mogmul before beginning your work.</target>

With hammer in hand, Mogzin remarks that the difference between this tool and the old ones is like night and day. It would seem Tarresson's intuition was correct, and with these tools the Mogmenders can forge further ahead on the path to mastery.</target>
