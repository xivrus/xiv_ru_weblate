Her heart thus unburdened, Alisaie bids you share some tales of your time in the north, and you duly recount an adventure near and dear to your heart.

"","TEXT_HEAVNE106_02346_SEQ_05<tab>Back at the Waking Sands, Urianger shares his latest findings. Per Alisaie's request, he has studied <var 1A 02 /var>The Gerun Oracles<var 1A 01 /var> and discovered a passage which suggests that a Rejoining would result in the deaths of all those living upon a reflection of the Source. Yet in death there is seemingly life as their souls would then be returned to the Source, where they might be reborn anew. Drastic as it sounds, Urianger speculates this may yet be preferable to the alternative, for it is possible that a world which falls to transcendent Light or Dark may ultimately be transformed into an unfathomable void.

Even as you pause to contemplate the implications of these theories, Urianger reveals that the Ishgardian smugglers supplying the beast tribes with crystals have been identified as remnants of the criminal network established by Eline Roaille─the infamous Garlean spymaster, the Ivy. What is more, the group has recently supplied crystals to another party: refugees devoted to the cause of Ala Mhigan liberation. Wasting no time, Alphinaud bids you and Alisaie accompany him to Little Ala Mhigo to track down the shipment's recipients and find out what they intend.

As you round the corner and head for the exit, you and the twins are contacted via linkpearl by Thancred, who proudly informs you of the latest developments in Ishgard. When he subsequently hears that you have obtained the same information, however, his disappointment is palpable.
