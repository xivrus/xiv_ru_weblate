Challenged by a brutish Garlean soldier named Grynewaht, you are soon embroiled in a skirmish with imperial forces.

Even as Omega takes flight, you cannot help but wonder if you have made a terrible mistake...

Initially, all seems to be proceeding as planned, but just as you begin to breathe a little more easily, the signal emanating from the weapon falls silent, prompting Cid to reengage its stasis systems.
