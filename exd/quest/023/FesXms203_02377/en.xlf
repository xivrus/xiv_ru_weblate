        <target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS203_02377_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You approach the raven-haired registrar, who is on the verge of quite literally tearing out his flowing locks as he laments his utter inability to lift young Reauverre's spirits. He quickly gathers himself and proposes that the two of you ask around to see what might be behind the boy's recent malaise. Mayhap the other children in the ward might be able to offer some insight.

Within the envelope is a missive from Reauverre's father─an apology for breaking a promise to visit his boy for Starlight. The registrar deduces that this is the cause for the boy's low spirits, and determines that the best course of action is to seek out the father and inform him of Reauverre's plight. He departs for the Hustings Strip to rendezvous with a friend who might have some information as to the father's whereabouts, and entreats you to join him there.</target>

He explains that the man is an old acquaintance of his mother's who was able to use his vast web of informants to ascertain the whereabouts of Reauverre's father─for a likely substantial fee. As the physician tells it, the boy's father is currently in Limsa Lominsa awaiting a vessel to carry him east to Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han. He bids you hurry there with news of Reauverre's state in hopes of catching the father before he sets sail.</target>

The man is deeply pained to hear of his son's despondent state, but explains that he simply cannot return to Ul'dah at this time. As he tells it, he is on the verge of procuring a sizable stock of the rare herb needed to treat his boy's illness─an opportunity that may never present itself again. He proffers a gift intended for Reauverre, and bids you take it to the boy in his stead. You resolve to return to the children's ward and do precisely that─after checking in with the registrar, of course.</target>
