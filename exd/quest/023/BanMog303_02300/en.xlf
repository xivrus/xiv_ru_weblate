Claiming that the melange of rocks has rendered all the shipments they received from the stonemasons next to worthless from a builder's standpoint, a flustered Mogek turns to you for help. Travel to Zenith and speak with the masonry moogle.

Deciding the best way to ensure the standardization of their product is to cut down the larger blocks to match the size of the smaller ones, he asks that you produce an item with which the masons will be able to do so. Synthesize stonemasonry supplies and see that they are delivered to the apprentice stonemasons.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the masonry moogle.</target>
