Terrifying though the spectacle must have been, a part of you cannot help wishing you had been present to see it... But even as you picture the scene, Alphinaud's inquiry about Yda's well-being draws you back to the present, and you proceed to the observation platform to find the grieving pugilist staring at the spot where the cocoon of light once hung. Yda turns at your arrival, and after appearing to come to a decision, shares the tale of her great deception, revealing at last that she is not Yda at all, but the fallen Archon's younger sister, Lyse. With her pledge to liberate Ala Mhigo still echoing in your mind, you prepare to follow Alphinaud back to the Rising Stones and the waiting Alisaie.</target>
