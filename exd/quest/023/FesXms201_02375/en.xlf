        <target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS201_02375_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Ever eager to fulfill her duty as a Starlight celebrant, Amh Garanjy is sparing no effort to bring happiness and good cheer to the children of the realm. Much to her chagrin, a parcel containing gifts for some unfortunate younglings has been mislaid or stolen, and she would seek your aid in retrieving it. So it is that you set forth for the Ruby Road Exchange, in hopes of delivering some much-needed joy to these boys and girls who are most wanting of smiles.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS201_02375_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The case of the missing parcel is solved: it was pilfered and hidden by one of the very younglings it was intended for, a boy who─unaware of the package's contents─stole away with it and hid it as a prank meant to rattle one of the physicians at the children's ward, where he is a patient. The raven-haired registrar there will surely be overjoyed to hear that the package has been retrieved safe and sound.</target>
