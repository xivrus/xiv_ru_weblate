He explains that only the most exceptional of Allag's warriors were expected to triumph against this artificial entity, and suggests that, as the Warrior of Light, you might benefit from the experience. Take the tomestone to the Flagship, and present the recording device to the verification node.</target>

Assemble a band of courageous companions, and face the Demon in all of his unrestrained might!
