As if in response to the mention of his name, the bat-winged voidsent descends upon the Parrock, and, after a decidedly one-sided battle, seizes the Nullstone scepter from Cait Sith's paws. Diabolos then threatens to tear the Parrock from the sky, only to withdraw when Radlia and a fleet of Talons arrive to reinforce the Redbills. Speak with the injured Leofard, and discuss what is to be done in the aftermath of the fiend's attack.

The familiar is convinced that the island where Radlia uncovered the Mhachi tome is the logical location of the fiend's stronghold, and counsels a swift and sudden assault. Reasoning that Leofard's injuries will only endanger the mission, however, Cait Sith instead recruits Radlia and her crew to escort you to the floating haven. Gather your party of battle-hardened adventurers, and ride the winds into the voidsent's lair!
