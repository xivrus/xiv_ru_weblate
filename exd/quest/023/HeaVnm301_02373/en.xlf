It seems the feline familiar is eager for you to return to the Parrock so that he can share his revelations with you and the Redbill crew. Fly over to the sky pirates' hideaway, and speak with Cait Sith inside Leofard's chambers.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Cait Sith once more holds court atop Leofard's table, and reveals the history behind his master, High Voidmage Cessair, and the summoning of Diabolos. As if in response to the mention of his name, the bat-winged voidsent descends upon the Parrock, and, after a decidedly one-sided battle, seizes the Nullstone scepter from Cait Sith's paws. Diabolos then threatens to tear the Parrock from the sky, only to withdraw when Radlia and a fleet of Talons arrive to reinforce the Redbills. Speak with the injured Leofard, and discuss what is to be done in the aftermath of the fiend's attack.

※The Parrock can be reached from the Redbill standard on Coldwind.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNM301_02373_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;With the secrets of the Nullstone's power now revealed to him, Cait Sith is desperate to recover the relic from Diabolos's clutches and carry out the will of his long-dead master. The familiar is convinced that the island where Radlia uncovered the Mhachi tome is the logical location of the fiend's stronghold, and counsels a swift and sudden assault. Reasoning that Leofard's injuries will only endanger the mission, however, Cait Sith instead recruits Radlia and her crew to escort you to the floating haven. Gather your party of battle-hardened adventurers, and ride the winds into the voidsent's lair!
