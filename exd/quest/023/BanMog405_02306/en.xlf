Mogek has interesting news to share.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG405_02306_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Mogek tells you of special statues once used to harness the magicks of dragons and a recent discovery of such devices in the Monsterie. In the hopes of discovering how they were used, he means to reawaken them with the help of Whei Ahf. Rather than go himself, of course, Mogek asks you to speak with Whei Ahf and convince him to help.
