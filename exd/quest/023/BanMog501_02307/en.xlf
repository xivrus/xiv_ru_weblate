While the actual preparation of the dish, spiced and stewed mushrooms and vegetables, is entrusted to capable paws, there are some elements that they require a more skilled hand to create. Synthesize the remaining touches of the dish and deliver them to the moogle in charge of the dish.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the meticulous moogle.</target>
