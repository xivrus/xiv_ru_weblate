Unfamiliar with the quirks of moogle culture and communication, the deftarm is incensed, and hurls a few choice invectives at Master Mogzin and the Mogmenders. Just as it seems the two may come to fisticuffs, Ohl Deeh arrives on the scene bearing grave news: the once-kindly Gullinbursti has suddenly flown into a bout of rage, and a Temple Knight now lies wounded or worse.
