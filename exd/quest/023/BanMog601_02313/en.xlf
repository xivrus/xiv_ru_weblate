        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG601_02313_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Mogek muses that the moss and grime on the buildings of the Churning Mists, while giving the structures character, tend to cling to any who lean against them and he has made the decision to assemble a group of moogles to clean them. That being said, the moogles at Zenith request use of your adept hands, literally.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG601_02313_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You arrive at a small tower behind Zenith, where you find two moogles and unexpectedly, a wyvern. The moogle in charge explains that they tried to use metal rasps brought to them by the Temple Knights, but they wore down far too easily. Chancing upon some shedded dragon skin on the ground, the moogles had the ingenious idea to try using hardened dragon scales instead, and an adolescent wyvern gladly offered his molting skin for the project. However, moogle paws are less adept than hands are at plucking the scales out of the molt, and they request that you use your hands to do it for them.</target>
