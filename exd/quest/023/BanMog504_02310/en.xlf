Mogek shakes his head.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG504_02310_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;An annoyed Mogek tells you that he allowed a group of moogles to take a break and explore the area around the enormous statue of Shiva south of Bahrr Lehs, but they have yet to return.

Inspired, the moogle declares that he too will become a sculptor and someday create a moogle monument as magnificent as the one of Shiva. Of course, no fledgling artisan works without some sort of guide. He requests that you create a small moogle statue to use as a model, using materials that his brother in Moghome would be happy to give you for free.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG504_02310_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Unexpectedly, the fledgling sculptor's brother is somewhat skeptical of his declaration to create something as great as the Shiva statue. Nevertheless, he acknowledges you came all the way to Moghome on his behalf, and hands you the materials required to make the minute model.
