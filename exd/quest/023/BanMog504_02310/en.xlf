He requests that you go and check on them to make sure they are staying out of trouble.

Inspired, the moogle declares that he too will become a sculptor and someday create a moogle monument as magnificent as the one of Shiva. Of course, no fledgling artisan works without some sort of guide. He requests that you create a small moogle statue to use as a model, using materials that his brother in Moghome would be happy to give you for free.</target>

Craft the high-quality moogle statuette and deliver it to the moogle at the Mother of the Sheave.</target>
