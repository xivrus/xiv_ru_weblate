However, their numbers are few, and the plaza of Bahrr Lehs is littered with large piles of rubble that must be cleared. Tarresson has asked the moogles at Asah for help, but suspects they are withholding aid on purpose, and he tasks Mogzin with bamboozling his kin into fulfilling their obligations. Although Mogzin has never managed to trick another moogle, he is heartened by Tarresson's rousing speech, and is eager to set forth to Asah at once and speak with Mogupp, leader of the moogles there. Tarresson asks you to accompany Mogzin, in case his will flags or his pom droops.</target>

Mogzin seemingly goes along with this transparent farce, but something tells you there is more to his kindly smile than meets the eye. The moogle instructs you to meet him at the base of the tower so you might discuss your rescue plan.</target>

Emboldened by this stroke of luck, he sets to work outlining his own scheme, but his enthusiasm wanes when he is unable to come up with something immediately. In an effort to lift Mogzin's spirits you remind him of Tarresson's wise words. Your speech serves its purpose, and Mogzin is struck with inspiration. He then departs for Moghome to seek the help of the alchemist Moghan.</target>

After the two moogles confer in whispers for a brief moment, Moghan hands over the medicine, ostensibly in an effort to provide the Mogmenders with proper emergency provisions. Mogzin seems satisfied by this arrangement, and says he will meet you at Asah after he completes some final preparations.</target>

After a short victory speech, they raise their bottles in unison. Before they can celebrate further, however, they become befuddled, and shortly thereafter fall unconscious. It is then that Mogzin reveals the secret ingredient: crushed cloud mallow, which in large quantities has a hypnotic effect. Mogzin flits down to the dozing moogles and whispers words praising the value of labor and hard work, and soon after they perk up and march off towards Bahrr Lehs. Mogzin, eager to see the fruits of his labor, follows them to see what motivated moogles can accomplish.</target>

Although they have just consumed a heavy dosage of cloud mallow, Mogzin insists that the best way to get them working again is sprinkle even more of the plant over their heads.
