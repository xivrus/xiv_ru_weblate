前回までの冒険録：
タレソンから、「友情の証」たる石像の修復にとりかかることを聞いた冒険者とモグジン。その場にいたオル・ディーの言葉から、一同は異端者から押収した彫像を見本に、修復することを決めた。冒険者はイシュガルドへ向かい、アンドゥルーから彫像を受け取るのだが、その際にタレソンの正体を聞かされる。タレソンは前ゼーメル伯爵、タレソン・ド・ゼーメルだった。己の心情を吐露するタレソンに頼まれ、石像の修復を手伝う冒険者。そのおかげか、モグジンたちは見事に石像を修復した。頃合いよく、様子を見に来たグリンブルスティは、石像をかつての「友情の証」とよく似ていると言い、ついにモグジンたちを認める。しかし、その様子に、モグジンは妥協したと感じるのだった……。
