Make your way to the Flagship, and wait for your comrades to arrive at the agreed rendezvous point.</target>

As Urianger ponders the inefficacy of his wards, Regula van Hydrus approaches your party and explains the reason for the magick's failure: a pulse of power from the soon-to-awaken Zurvan. The legatus quickly describes the dire situation, and urges you to join him and his troops in preventing the Demon's thralls from rousing their master. Hurry after Unukalhai, and delve into central Azys Lla.</target>

But the temporary victory is not without a cost: in an unexpected act of heroism, Regula is struck down as he defends an overmatched Unukalhai. With his dying breath, the legatus bids you complete his duty, and slay the Demon and his followers. You withdraw with your companions, and the masked youth stands somewhat apart, shaken and disbelieving...

He speaks of his birth on a different star, and of how that world became what is now known as the void. Though born with the power of the Echo, Unukalhai describes how he was yet too young to contend with the forces that brought such ruination, and of how a sudden shift in the balance between Light and Dark can consign an entire world to oblivion. His spirit snatched into the safety of the rift by his present master, Unukalhai explains that he came to Hydaelyn determined to prevent the realm from suffering a similar fate. And now that he walks alongside the Scions and the Warrior of Light, he may just yet become the hero he was destined to be.</target>
