However, there have been no signs or news of the airship which was to deliver the cargo bells ago. Mogek requests that you travel to the Rookery to see if there have been any mishaps.

He entrusts the task to you as someone better suited to craft the pieces. Make a set of toy airships for the dragonets using the materials that the Temple Knight has provided.
