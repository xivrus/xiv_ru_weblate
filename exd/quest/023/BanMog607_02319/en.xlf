				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANMOG607_02319_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;After discovering that the roar of dragons can strengthen the aspect of crystals in the vicinity, Mogek wonders whether the roar will have the same effect on kupa trees, strengthening the crystals growing within their massive trunks. He asks you to call upon Whei Ahf to test the theory, while also taking advantage of the opportunity to have him roar to strengthen a crystal cluster.
