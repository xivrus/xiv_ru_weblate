She introduces herself as the leader of the Crystal Caravan, a traveling puppet troupe. The group plans to mark the anniversary of the realm's rebirth by putting on a play depicting the Calamity, but the actor assigned the part of the Warrior of Light would like more information to fully bring his role to life. On top of that, the script the troupe has been given is proving less than helpful in determining how best to act. Desiring to host the most entertaining show possible, the troupe asks you to bring their would-be hero to the Quicksand, that he might hear Momodi's version of events and use her story to inform his performance.

He tells of how the dreadwyrm Bahamut burst forth from the moon, blanketing the land with flame. The old pirate further says that although they faced certain doom, the troops fought on, until almost as suddenly as he appeared, the dragon vanished from the skies. Although no one knows exactly what happened, the realm was spared certain annihilation. The budding thespian is once again inspired, pledging to capture the heroism of the soldiers and the ferocity of Bahamut.
