        <target state="final">TEXT_FESANV201_02329_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Among the festive trappings of the Ruby Road Exchange you hear a voice call out to you, and upon turning to answer you see it belongs to an exotically dressed Lalafell. She introduces herself as the leader of the Crystal Caravan, a traveling puppet troupe. The group plans to mark the anniversary of the realm's rebirth by putting on a play depicting the Calamity, but the actor assigned the part of the Warrior of Light would like more information to fully bring his role to life. On top of that, the script the troupe has been given is proving less than helpful in determining how best to act. Desiring to host the most entertaining show possible, the troupe asks you to bring their would-be hero to the Quicksand, that he might hear Momodi's version of events and use her story to inform his performance.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone.</target>

She stresses that at the very least, the selflessness of their deeds should be remembered, and the Crystal Caravan's actor promises to live up to her request. The Quicksand proprietress suggests visiting Baderon at the Drowning Wench, so you might gain further knowledge of that fateful day.</target>

He tells of how the dreadwyrm Bahamut burst forth from the moon, blanketing the land with flame. The old pirate further says that although they faced certain doom, the troops fought on, until almost as suddenly as he appeared, the dragon vanished from the skies. Although no one knows exactly what happened, the realm was spared certain annihilation. The budding thespian is once again inspired, pledging to capture the heroism of the soldiers and the ferocity of Bahamut. Baderon suggests you ask one more person for their tale: Miounne at the Carline Canopy. Sensing that his muse is stirring, the actor departs for Gridania.</target>

She says the man is much loved in Gridania, even now, and that he often worked together with the Warriors of Light. His sacrifice at the Battle of Carteneau is remembered by one and all, and Miounne's words encourage the Crystal Caravan star to immortalize the Archon's deeds on the stage. With his muse stirred from its slumber, the actor returns to Ul'dah, where he will commence rehearsing his role with a new fervor.</target>

Crestfallen that they might miss an opportunity to perform, the troupe is about to give up when their leader is struck with a brilliant idea. She suggests that you take the stage in the injured actor's stead, a suggestion to which you readily agree. Although you are inexperienced, the ventriloquists assure you they can carry even the poorest acting. Steel yourself to give the performance of a lifetime, and speak with the Crystal Caravan leader once you are ready to begin preparations for the play.</target>
