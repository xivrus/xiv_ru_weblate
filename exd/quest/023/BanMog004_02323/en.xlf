The dragon, through Ohl Deeh, has demanded that you cease your work on Bahrr Lehs and leave at once. Sensing that there may be some hope of reconciliation, Tarresson decides that the best course of action is to meet with Gullinbursti and explain the situation. He asks you and Mogzin to accompany him, and follows Ohl Deeh to the ancient dragon's location.</target>
