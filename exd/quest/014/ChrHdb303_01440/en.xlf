Upon learning that you are the adventurer who bested the duelist Gilgamesh, he becomes convinced that you are the only one who can quash the vegetable insurrection. This might also afford you the perfect opportunity to reclaim the shipment of vegetables intended for Costa del Sol. Make for the Isles of Umbra, where a tyrannical vegetocracy rules with an iron fist, and pluck mandragora buds to ensure that their numbers do not grow.</target>

Confusion ensues upon inspecting the crate's contents, however, as the prized purple dragon peppers sought by Lewenhart are nowhere to be found, with peppers of a vivid blue in their place. Inspector Briardien quickly deduces that Lewenhart is none other than the phantom thief─he saw the peppers through red goggles while still in disguise as a Brass Blade. Before you can apprehend him, the fiend sprints off in the direction of north Bloodshore. Pursue him with all haste.</target>
