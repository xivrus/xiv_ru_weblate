Return to Novv's Nursery to see that the peaceful Sahagin come to no harm, and bring along Robyn's gift─a sack of juicy oranges favored by the fishmen─for good measure.</target>

Could the culprit be the same man responsible for the disappearance of the podlings from Little Solace? Make way to the scene of the crime─Moonshade Isle─by elbst, and fend off adversaries as necessary to secure a vantage point from which you may scan the waters for the kidnapper's escape vessel.</target>

In the blink of an eye, the clutchfather emerges from the sea to stand before his son's abductor─a menacing Miqo'te wearing a mask of metal. When an ill-timed collision with a protruding rock causes Bouu to lose his balance, the feline felon is quick to take advantage of the situation. As Novv moves to shield his spawnling, three daggers strike the Sahagin clear in the back. Seww dives swiftly into the waters to save his clutchfather, urging you to return to the nursery to prepare to tend to Novv's wounds.</target>
