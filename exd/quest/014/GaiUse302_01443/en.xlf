        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE302_01443_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;During your conversation with General Raubahn, Alphinaud observes that the refugees were surprisingly well armed and suggests that the riot may have been instigated by outside forces. Before he can finish his thought, however, the Flame General interjects that the restoration of order is paramount, and that any official investigation will have to wait. Undeterred, Alphinaud resolves to conduct an investigation of his own. He suggests that you begin by finding out which settlements the Flames suspect may be harboring belligerents. Perhaps Commander Swift will be willing to share such information with you.</target>

Apparently, he offered the refugees a chance to hold the rulers of Ul'dah to account, and attracted no shortage of volunteers. Zazawaka, however, was unconvinced, and refused to go with the other refugees─a decision vindicated when one of them returned, traumatized by the slaughter he had barely escaped. Zazawaka believes there may be more survivors, and implores you to find them before the Flames do. Ask the terrified refugee if he knows where his comrades are.</target>

Recalling that the other group has yet to return to Lost Hope, he begs you to seek them out and convince them to return.</target>
