        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSD401_01474_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Rammbroes informs you that the investigation of the Crystal Tower is being hindered by the most mundane of security measures: a gate that refuses to open. Even as Cid and G'raha Tia rack their brains to find a solution, two peculiar individuals arrive and offer their aid. They introduce themselves as Doga and Unei, scholars of ancient Allag sent by the Students of Baldesion. Though Rammbroes is at first suspicious of their origin, he relents at G'raha Tia's behest, and allows them to join NOAH in an advisory capacity. Without further ado, Doga and Unei are asked to examine the sealed gate which leads into Syrcus Tower. Accompany the two scholars to the Eight Sentinels, and there speak with Biggs to be shown to the gate.</target>

In his desire to bring the world under his rule, Xande consorted with forbidden powers. Fearful of what might befall the world, the original Doga and Unei attempted to thwart their emperor's scheme. They imbued their clones with their will, that their work might continue in the event of their deaths. After millennia in slumber, the two clones now seek to finish what their namesakes had begun, but they require your help to succeed. The members of NOAH unanimously agree to join their cause, and Rammbroes tasks you with eliminating all hostile elements within Syrcus Tower and finally defeating Emperor Xande. See to your preparations, then speak with G'raha Tia.</target>
