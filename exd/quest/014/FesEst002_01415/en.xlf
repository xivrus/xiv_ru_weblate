				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESEST002_01415_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Oscarlet teaches you the origins of Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide, a fledgling festival founded by Jihli Aliapoh, who claims to have been blessed with a vision from the Twelve Archons of the Sixth Umbral Era. Eager to have you partake in the revelry, Oscarlet bids you speak with the celebration's founder, but not before acquiring a pristine egg cap from one of his fellow Dreamers. After donning your festival cap, proceed to Gridania and seek out Jihli Aliapoh, that you may learn more about Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESEST002_01415_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;There is still time before Hatching Hour, the final ceremony heralding the Twelve Archons' return to Eorzea. To that end, Jihli Aliapoh encourages you to try your hand at egg hunting, a popular Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide festival activity. She informs you of the different kinds of eggs which can be opened to reveal a gift, or exchanged for eggs of higher quality with richer rewards.

As you prepare to set out on an egg&lt;var 1F /var&gt;hunting adventure, however, she asks that you pay her a visit when you've had your fill of festival games. Though preparations appear to be going as planned, perhaps this year's Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide is beset with more troubles than she would have you believe.</target>
