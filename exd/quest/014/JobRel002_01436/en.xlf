        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL002_01436_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;According to Jalzahn, your relic weapon still has room to grow. If you would enhance it further, you must recreate the valorous deeds of the Zodiac Braves, revered heroes in Thavnairian legend. So as to take the guesswork out of the process, Jalzahn suggests you acquire the “Trials of the Braves,” a collection of sacred texts that tell of the heroes' deeds. As a known vendor of such literature, perhaps Rowena will have the books in stock.</target>
