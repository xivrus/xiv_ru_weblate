Though the Ixal succeeded in driving off the enemy, it would appear some foul deed or another has already been done. Upon hearing your explanation, all present are in consensus that the beastman abductor you pursue is responsible. Tataramu bids you to travel to the scene of the attack near Hyrstmill and search for any remnants of the damaged vessel.</target>
