In order to prevent the pillaged goods from supplying the bloody schemes of the Coral Tridents, the spawnling asks that you set fire to the pitch-caulked chests of the tattooed thugs. Borrow an elbst from his clutchmate Pahh, and use the small flint stone to strike sparks aboard the Reavers' ship.</target>

One rarely has the need to fear open flames in the middle of the ocean, but, armed with a shhhimple flint shhhtone, the Reavers will shhhoon learn to fear you!
Have Pahh lend you a shhheabeast, and make your way to the pirates' shhhip as shhhoon as you are able.</target>
