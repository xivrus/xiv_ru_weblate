She informs you that Quentenain, a regular at the Wench, was drinking with the stranger and might know something about his whereabouts.</target>

Despite having no interest in seeing the raucous Roegadyn's possessions returned, he nevertheless suggests that you may find your man at the Lominsan ferry docks.</target>

Seemed to be getting on well with one of our regulars, Quentenain. Perhaps you could still catch up with him and spare me the headache. I'd offer you a free drink, but last time I did that Baderon docked my wages.</target>
