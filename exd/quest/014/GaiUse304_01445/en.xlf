Unsurprisingly, Landebert has no intention of listening to your side of the story, nor less of helping you. Yet in a curious twist of fate, your quarry chooses that exact moment to return to Pearl Lane, presumably hoping to recruit more refugees. As your eyes meet, the merchant grasps the situation and turns to flee. Do not let him escape!</target>

The commotion draws the attention of two Stone Torches, one of whom would like to know why you are standing next to a dead man.</target>
