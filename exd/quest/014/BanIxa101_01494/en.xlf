Many would deign to call themselves able, but Yazel Ahuatan the Able goes so far as to claim it as his title.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 1 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 41 and above.</target>

His challenge is further complicated by the requirement that you use special facilities in Hyrstmill to craft the component─facilities which are administered by Dametta, a woman of some repute, who may not be amenable to your request.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

A particularly persistent opo&lt;var 1F /var&gt;opo has been raiding her stores for some time, and she would have you permanently resolve the situation. With the aid of ripe Mun&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Tuy beans, lure the beastkin out from his lair near E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Tatt's Spire and end his reign of terror once and for all. Alternatively, you could converse with the woman further and attempt to persuade her...but that approach may not end well.</target>
