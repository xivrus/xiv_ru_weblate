				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESEST005_01418_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You have arrived in Limsa Lominsa to discover the two eggs have been transported unharmed, but their carriers were attacked by a gang of spriggans in the process. What's more, they have forced their way through the city gates and now scour the decks in search of the Archon eggs. Oscarlet informs you that Augustiniel was one of the two tasked with egg delivery, and has since made his way to the Coral Tower, perhaps in the hope of eluding the rogue spriggans now roaming the decks of Limsa Lominsa. Injured and with only one way in or out of the Coral Tower, however, there will be no escape should a second confrontation with the spriggans take place.

The eggs must be moved as quickly as possible, but both eggs cannot be carried alone. To see the eggs safely back to the Aftcastle, you must seek the aid of another adventurer. One of you must wear a pristine egg cap, and the other a brilliant egg cap. Join forces with a fellow adventurer and make your way to the Coral Tower, where you will prepare to relocate the Archon eggs.</target>

If they are to be delivered without incident, both you and your partner must carry an egg to the Aftcastle. Wearing the cap you have chosen, pick up your matching Archon egg and prepare for some fancy footwork.</target>
