She further explains that she took on her current position in the Adventurers' Guild out of a desire to be a guiding hand to all those who would dream of serving the realm, and that she wears Momoroto's hairpin as a reminder of what can happen if well-meant words of encouragement are carried too far. Moved by Momodi's rousing speech, Thomas vows to find a dream of his own, one that might at last win him the admiration and affection of his beloved.</target>
