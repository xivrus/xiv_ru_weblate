With a group of spriggans now roaming the halls of Ul'dah, Orselfaux is concerned that Augustiniel is not fit to watch the eggs, and would ask that you seek him out to ensure they are secure. Orselfaux suspects the eggs may need to be moved to a safer location, and suggests you seek the aid of another adventurer to assist you in Augustiniel's stead. Team up with a like&lt;var 1F /var&gt;minded adventurer and search for Augustiniel and the eggs on the Steps of Thal.</target>
