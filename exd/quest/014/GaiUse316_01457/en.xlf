The Scion goes on to lament that though the three nations' leaders are not opposed to the idea itself, endless deliberations over its implementation have slowed progress to a crawl. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of such a company and thus encourage the leaders to come to an agreement, Alphinaud explains that he has proposed the creation of a smaller, precursor organization─the vanguard to a future united Eorzea. The young Elezen requests that you join him on his journey to each of the three nations that you might begin scouting potential members for this trial company while he is engaged with finalizing the bureaucratic formalities. Head first to Limsa Lominsa and rendezvous with Alphinaud at Bulwark Hall.</target>
