Memeriga, an unscrupulous merchant known as the Deathmonger, intends to raise an army of undead beastmen. With time running short, seek out his hired blade, Nhaza'a Jaab, at his lodgings at the Platinum Mirage, that you might extract from him the whereabouts of his master.

Despite having no real incentive to do so, Nhaza'a Jaab reveals that Memeriga may be found at the Invisible City, seemingly intrigued by the prospect of facing you and your comrades in a battle to the death. Meanwhile, Sylvie reveals herself as a sylph by the name of Silbexio, and you finally understand why the young girl was so passionate about seeking revenge for the lost beastmen.

Fortunately, your beastman allies arrive on the scene with impeccable timing, providing a much-welcome opening for you and Silbexio.

In the meantime, your beastman allies are not faring as well in their battle against the Ebon Claw. Clutchfather Novv's attack is disarmed with ease, and it appears hope is lost. However, the true strength of the Beastman Alliance only truly emerges when they fight as one. Protected by Elder Frixio's magical shield, Hamujj Gah penetrates the Miqo'te sellsword's defenses and stuns him with a crushing blow. In the next instant, Sezul Totoloc tosses his weapon to Clutchfather Novv, who leaps to the sky. Given extra momentum by a bomb booster pack triggered by Gi Gu, he flies at Nhaza'a Jaab, striking a mighty blow. In utter disbelief at his own defeat, the battered sellsword stumbles over the walls to what seems like his demise...until the Miqo'te safely lands on Memeriga's airship, which he had commandeered as his personal escape vessel. Swearing revenge, he attempts to flee to safety, but is quickly brought down almost by accident when Gi Gu detonates a set of bombs that had found their way on board.
