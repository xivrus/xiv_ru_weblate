        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNM303_01480_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Recent rumors surrounding the appearance of a flying monstrosity in the vicinity of Dun Scaith have been troubling Slipslix. You resolve to aid him by traveling to the floating island, that you might track down some concrete evidence of the being's existence. The goblin tasks you with procuring a piece of this strange entity, in hopes that it will bring him closer to revealing the truth behind its identity.

Slipslix theorizes that it mistook a mighty voidsent on the island for a primal, setting out to obliterate it. Slipslix presents you with a curious sheet of metal retrieved from the ancient weapon, inviting you to deliver it to his compatriot Slimthix and claim your well-deserved reward.</target>
