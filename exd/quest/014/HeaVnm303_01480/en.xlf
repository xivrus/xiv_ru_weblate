You resolve to aid him by traveling to the floating island, that you might track down some concrete evidence of the being's existence. The goblin tasks you with procuring a piece of this strange entity, in hopes that it will bring him closer to revealing the truth behind its identity.

Slipslix theorizes that it mistook a mighty voidsent on the island for a primal, setting out to obliterate it. Slipslix presents you with a curious sheet of metal retrieved from the ancient weapon, inviting you to deliver it to his compatriot Slimthix and claim your well-deserved reward.</target>
