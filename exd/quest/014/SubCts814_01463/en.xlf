Now, I ask ye: what if there were a way to melt down a couple pieces of materia that weren't availin' you naught, and mold them into a shiny new piece that─Nymeia willin'─just might strike yer fancy?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="50" approved="yes"><source>50</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS814_01463_KOKOSAMU_000_002&lt;tab&gt;Now, if yer as sharp as I reckon ye are, ye can already see where I'm headin' with this.

Uplander seeks knowings of shifty-making, yes?
