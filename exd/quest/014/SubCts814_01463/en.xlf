        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS814_01463_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;As Kokosamu tells it, Master Mutamix has developed a method for combining multiple pieces of unneeded materia to give them new form and life─a procedure known as transmutation. He encourages you to speak with the esteemed goblin scholar, that you might enlighten yourself as to the specifics.</target>

To take the goblin up on his offer, you need only bring him five pieces of unwanted materia.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS814_01463_KOKOSAMU_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Well, &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;I&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; have, and I tell ye, it felt like I'd brought a sack full o' fishin' poles to a gold mine. Now, I ask ye: what if there were a way to melt down a couple pieces of materia that weren't availin' you naught, and mold them into a shiny new piece that─Nymeia willin'─just might strike yer fancy?</target>

Rather, that's what Master Mutamix calls it. Meself, I've coined the term &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;transmutation&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, which I'm hopin' might find favor with adventurers like yerself.</target>

You'll find Mutamix right over there, likely jumpin' out of his boots lookin' to trade tongueflaps about his discovery.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS814_01463_MUTAMIX_000_021&lt;tab&gt;Process of shifty-making is of big help-use. First, be taking five need-not materia, yes? Melty-mix this one, mixy-melt that one, squeeze and squash, then bigeyes! Five need-not are reborn as one shiny-new!</target>
