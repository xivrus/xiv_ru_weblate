While he is dismissing your concerns, however, your conversation is interrupted by the arrival of an injured group of adventurers. You soon learn that the adventurers─and the provisions they were charged with escorting─were set upon by a band of Coerthan heretics near the border to Mor Dhona. Slafborn asks that you travel to Coerthas and aid House Fortemps in tracking down the stolen shipment meant for the frontier hands of Revenant's Toll. Make your way to Camp Dragonhead and call upon Lord Haurchefant.</target>
