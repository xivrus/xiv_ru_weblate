As ablest of Ixal, Yazel Ahuatan has a reputation to maintain.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 1 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 41 and above.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANIXA103_01496_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The recent loss of starboard hull component materials has placed Yazel Ahuatan in a precarious position. So that none may have cause to doubt his ableness, recover the materials his courier abandoned when attacked by Ixal in Treespeak.

Maintaining an image as an able Ixal can be difficult at times, but the adulation of Ixali maidens more than justifies the effort─or so Yazel Ahuatan would doubtless say, if the question were put to him.</target>
