As ablest of Ixal, Yazel Ahuatan has a reputation to maintain.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 1 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 41 and above.</target>

So that none may have cause to doubt his ableness, recover the materials his courier abandoned when attacked by Ixal in Treespeak.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

However, returning the materials will not suffice to redeem Yazel Ahuatan. Visit the crafting facility at Treespeak Stables, and present the component materials to Nellemond, so that you may use the facilities to construct the requisite components.</target>

Maintaining an image as an able Ixal can be difficult at times, but the adulation of Ixali maidens more than justifies the effort─or so Yazel Ahuatan would doubtless say, if the question were put to him.</target>
