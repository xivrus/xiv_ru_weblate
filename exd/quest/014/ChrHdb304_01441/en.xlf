Obtain a set of servant's garb from the Gegeruju Manor retainer that may serve as a suitable disguise for the maiden. In the meantime, Hildibrand has been charged with creating a diversion to distract Vannes from the absence of his betrothed.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CHRHDB304_01441_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;Hildibrand's flawless plan, in a nutshell, involved donning the dress and presenting himself as the lapis maiden. When Vannes reacts with utter shock, Hildibrand concludes that he is the phantom thief in disguise, as the true Vannes─who had never before seen Miss Arabella's face─would never have suspected that aught was amiss. His logic failing to find a sympathetic ear, Hildibrand is immediately seized by the Brass Blades of the Gerbera.

No sooner does this happen than does Vannes recognize Arabella amidst the crowd and grab her by the hand. Inspector Briardien recognizes the glove on Vannes's right hand, but before he can take action, the thief reveals himself in a puff of smoke, summoning the vicious Mandragoras to protect him. A close encounter with Hildibrand sends the rogue vegetables fleeing in terror, but the thief has already made off with his treasure─not the maiden herself, but the neckpiece she wore.

As Miss Arabella, now free from her betrothal to Vannes, breathes a sigh of relief, a flying card of challenge buries itself in Hildibrand's pate, writ “I shall come to claim the victor's spoils.” Though Inspector Briardien finally deduces that the thief and the mad bombardier who almost claimed his life are not one and the same, the two inspectors nevertheless vow that the thief has stolen his last treasure.</target>
