				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESEST004_01417_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Jihli Aliapoh tells you of her vision which inspired the designs for this year's Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide eggs. However, because the celebration requires eggs, both great and small, in seemingly unreasonable quantities, the frequent delivery of these goods has caught the eye of local spriggans. Ever wont to procure all things small and round, they now work to make all the eggs their own, stealing the Archon eggs in the process.

Maisenta of Black Rabbit Traders dispatched men to retrieve two of the eggs, which have since been delivered to the Yellow Serpent Gate. With spriggans now forcing their way into Gridania, however, she can spare no one to bring them further into town. Jihli implores you to retrieve the eggs, that they may serve as vessels for the Twelve Archons.

Before you set off to retrieve them, however, she offers you a warning: the Archon eggs may only be touched by one who bears their mark. In order to transport both eggs to a safe location in a timely manner, join forces with another adventurer. One of you must wear a pristine egg cap, the other a vibrant egg cap. When you have found a comrade-in-arms, and are both wearing an appropriate cap, speak with Augustiniel at the Yellow Serpent Gate.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
