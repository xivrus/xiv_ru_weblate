Though the realm is not yet free of strife, the Antecedent stresses that your deeds inspire countless Eorzeans to continue along the difficult road to peace. Conscious that you cannot be expected to spend your every waking moment attending to realm-shaking matters, however, she encourages you to stay awhile in Revenant's Toll. Just when it seems as if you have been granted leave to rest, Minfilia asks that you spare a moment to indulge the attention of the Doman children. Speak with Yozan within the Rising Stones.</target>
