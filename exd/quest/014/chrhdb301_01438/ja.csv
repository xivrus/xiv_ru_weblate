She further explains that the maiden has recently been betrothed to the son of a Lominsan trading mogul, and is to make a rare public appearance at a banquet to be held in the couple's honor. Surmising that the thief is likely to strike, Ellie declares her intention to travel to Costa del Sol and speak with the bride's father, Guguremu, and invites you to come along.","TEXT_CHRHDB301_01438_SEQ_01<tab>前回までの冒険録：<br>「武器怪盗ギルガメッシュ」を撃退したという喜びもつかの間、ヒルディブランドたちの目の前で「契約の剣」は奪われてしまった。「怪盗白仮面」を名乗る人物から届いた黒塗りのカードには、「るり色の乙女の唇をいただきに参ります」という、新たな犯行予告が書かれていた。ヒルディブランドたちは、怪盗白仮面の予告を防ぐことができるのだろうか……？<br>　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*<br>エリーが調べた情報によると、予告状に記されていた「るり色の乙女」は、ウルダハの令嬢「アラベラ」のことを指しているという。彼女はコスタ・デル・ソルで行われる貿易商会のパーティーで、自身の婚約を発表する予定らしい。東ラノシアのコスタ・デル・ソルに向かい、パーティーの主催者である彼女の父「ググレム」と話そう。","","False","0x00000001","",""
