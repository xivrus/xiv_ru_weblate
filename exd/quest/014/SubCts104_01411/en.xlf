        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS104_01411_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Your wanderings have led you into the company of one Bloezoeng, a local chef in the Seventh Heaven. As it turns out, you and he share a mutual acquaintance: Dyrstweitz, the owner of the Flying Shark in Costa del Sol. Dyrstweitz, it would seem, has sent out a call for help on behalf of his own friend, Wheiskaet. For friendship's sake, seek out Wheiskaet in eastern La Noscea to see what is troubling him.</target>
