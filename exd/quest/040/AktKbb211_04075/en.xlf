        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Sufficiently impressed with your growth, Drusilla declares you ready to face her voidsent nemesis, Orcus. Arnegis and Hermin, another of her trusted Lemures, tell of a woodcutter gone missing in the Central Shroud, and a man with pale skin and fiery eyes spotted nearby that matches Orcus's description. Before you can depart, however, Hermin voices concerns regarding your involvement in the secretive group's affairs, prompting Drusilla to reveal her personal history with the wicked voidsent, who murdered every member of her flesh-and-blood family. Acutely aware of the threat Orcus poses, Drusilla is willing to rely on any and every advantage, including the assistance of an outsider. With the matter settled, you depart for Bentbranch Meadows to begin the search for your murderous prey.</target>

She presents you with a blood-scented candle and a magitek transceiver, instructing you to light the former to draw out any nearby fiends. If Orcus happens to be among them, she asks you to call her on the transceiver so she can come to your aid.</target>

The monster does not appear to be Orcus, but does leave behind a blood-soaked ring. Arnegis may be able to shed some light on the nature of this trinket and how a voidsent would come into possession of it.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBB211_04075_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Drusilla tells you and Arnegis that she found a body hastily buried under some overgrowth─a body which matched the description of the woodcutter and bore the mark of a ring removed from its finger. It seems that the voidsent you drew forth from the woods killed the man to claim the object of its obsession. While Orcus is nowhere to be found, there is one less monster preying on defenseless souls. Arnegis leaves to apprise the Wood Wailers of what transpired, and Drusilla asks you to return with her to Lemures headquarters.

※You may re-enter Lemures headquarters by speaking with the loyal Lemure in Pearl Lane.</target>

Hermin chimes in to say that she found a promising bit of information while you were away that Arnegis is already investigating. His work is delicate, however, and will take some time to be completed to satisfaction. Drusilla bids you practice your trade further, so that when Orcus is finally found, victory will be all but assured.

※The next reaper quest will be available from Drusilla upon reaching level 75.</target>
