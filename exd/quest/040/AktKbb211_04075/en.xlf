Before you can depart, however, Hermin voices concerns regarding your involvement in the secretive group's affairs, prompting Drusilla to reveal her personal history with the wicked voidsent, who murdered every member of her flesh-and-blood family. Acutely aware of the threat Orcus poses, Drusilla is willing to rely on any and every advantage, including the assistance of an outsider.
