        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKMK101_04058_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;During your reunion with Urianger in Ala Mhigo, you are joined by Arenvald, who it seems also has business in the city. After an endearingly brotherly exchange with Alphinaud, he leaves you to take part in the meeting. There, Lyse relays a shocking tale. Resistance scouts sent to investigate the tower that had recently appeared nearby subsequently attempted to murder their comrades, having apparently been turned into fanatical servants of Garlemald─or, more accurately, &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;tempered&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. It is at this point that Raubahn reveals his intention to send a second party to the tower in the form of Arenvald and Fordola, both of whom are immune to the effects of tempering. Alphinaud is clearly apprehensive about Arenvald's involvement in this dangerous undertaking, and the pair agree to discuss the matter when the meeting is over.</target>

While he and Fordola investigate the tower in Paglth'an, Alphinaud suggests you pursue Lunar Bahamut, but before he can continue, he is interrupted by a linkpearl call from Tataru. In flustered tones, she reports that she and Krile recently succeeded in catching up with Estinien, though he departed for Ishgard as soon as they informed him of the reappearance of the elder primal. As there are few more experienced in matters draconic, you decide to give chase in the hope of enlisting his help.</target>
