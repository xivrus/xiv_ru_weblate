He asks that you accompany his troops into the warship, and at last put an end to the IVth Legion's schemes to control Bozja.

There is no time to revel in your victory, however, for the Allagan weapon, which lay dormant in the ship, breaks free from its confines. It takes to the sky and begins amassing energy to release in an attack of cataclysmic proportions. Before delivering its fatal blow to the people of Bozja, however, Queen Gunnhildr appears, her holy blade in hand.
