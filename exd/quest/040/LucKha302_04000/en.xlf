To wit: he would see completion of the reconstruction effort celebrated─and pay tribute to Lord Francel's selfless contributions─by holding a surprise commemorative concert. He has already recruited Marcelloix to the cause, and the enterprising provisioner has already prepared a host of instruments. Finally, they suggest one final step to make the occasion truly special─they intend for you and Francel to take the stage together and perform a duet. That said, they are unsure as to what instrument the young lord most fancies. At their request, you offer to inquire with Foncrineau, that you might glean the information necessary.</target>
