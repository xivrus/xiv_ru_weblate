That, along with a blunted dagger delivered to Lemures headquarters as a threat, has put everyone on edge. She suggests investigating the claims, both to gather potentially useful information and to escape from her quarters for a spell. You are to speak with family at Black Brush Station, from where one of the reports originated.</target>

After you introduce yourself as a friend of Drusilla, she regales you with the tale of how she and her beloved fled Garlemald, displaying an eagerness to divulge personal details that appears oddly common amongst the Lemures. She then informs you that it was not her, but her beloved who spied the dread figure in the desert, and begs you to ask him for further details─and, if you are able, bring an end to the vile menace.</target>

She then asks for your thoughts on the disparate members of the Lemures before speaking of how all fled their homeland of Garlemald. She goes on to recount her own experiences at length, telling the story of her grandfather Rullus's failed assassination of Solus zos Galvus, and his subsequent pursuit of power that led to his possession by Orcus and her flight to Eorzea. While the memories are plainly not easy for her to recall, her willingness to share is proof that she has come to think of you as a member of her found family. Tired from the day's work, she bids you return to headquarters.

No sooner does she share this intuition than Orcus appears, scythe poised to remove her head from her shoulders. Though titillated by the hatred and fear he sees smoldering within you, he yearns to see his meal grow even more flavorful, and to that end declares that he will torture Drusilla at his leisure, all the while waiting for your soul to attain its full delicious potential. With those parting words, Orcus returns to the shadows whence he came, leaving you and Hermin alone in Drusilla's chambers. The gobsmacked girl looks as if she could use some comforting words, or perhaps an outlet for her rising anger.</target>

In the meantime, you must keep your skills sharp, for only a reaper can cut Orcus down.
