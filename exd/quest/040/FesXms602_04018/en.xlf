To that end, she bids you consult with young Isainne, whom the celebrant-in-chief has tasked with ensuring that the decorations in Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre are up to seasonal standards.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Follow her to the Shaded Bower to see precisely what might be the matter with the slipshod snowmen he made.</target>

Your rejoicing is interrupted, however, by the ever-abrasive Kamlito Halito, who looks down his nose at your efforts, defending the “efficiency” of his own work and proclaiming that the entire event would be more successful were he in charge. Insulted by his insinuations that Starlight is all about greed and receiving material goods, Isainne stomps off─leading the Saint of Nymeia to come to the scene and deliver his charge a good scolding. With hope that the youth might have learned his lesson this time, you return to Amh Garanjy to claim another hard-earned reward.</target>
