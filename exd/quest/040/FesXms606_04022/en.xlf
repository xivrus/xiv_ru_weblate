        <target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS606_04022_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With preparations for the Starlight Celebration all but completed, the time is nigh for your final task─fashioning a decoration that will serve as a personal gift to your fellow helper Isainne in her time of greatest need. Amh Garanjy encourages you to reflect on all you have learned about your young friend and what she wants most this season, and to let inspiration carry you where it will. Giving deep thought to the matter, you set out to make one child's Starlight dreams come true.

Amh Garanjy, Kamlito Halito, and no lesser a personage than the Saint of Nymeia himself lavish praise upon you for your most inspired work, and Isainne is nigh moved to tears at your most touching gesture. The saint further brightens the mood with the news that they were able to procure sufficient quantities of the remedy, meaning that Isainne's father might be cured of his dreadful malady at last, allowing them to celebrate the season as a family after all. What began with a worry that the festivities might be called off entirely has ended with a Starlight miracle for the ages. Happy to have played your part to see smiles come to the realm once more, you bid a fond farewell to your companions and set out to enjoy the season in your own way.</target>
