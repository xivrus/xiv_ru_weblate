        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKSA352_04098_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In exchange for the metal alloy, the House of Splendors has asked for two sets of freshly penned memoirs. They went on to say these tales of heated battle should be based on encounters in Bozja or, failing that, those of an otherworldly nature. There is a pained look in Zlatan's eyes as he tells you they have asked for thirty volumes of each. And so he bids you safe travels as you set off to the battlefield in search of inspiration for your writings.

※Memoirs can be obtained by participating in skirmishes and critical engagements in Zadnor, as well as any of the normal Omega 8-man raids. The Unrestricted Party option cannot be enabled when clearing the aforementioned duties.</target>

Regana's associates are thrilled to have completed the transaction, but apparently more so to meet Gerolt. They shower him with compliments, followed by a proposal for a wholesale contract for additional shipments of metal alloy. You quickly interject before he has the chance to accept, prompting the attendants to take their leave. Though no new contracts were signed, you are one step closer to a more powerful Resistance weapon.</target>
