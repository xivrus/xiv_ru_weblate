As he tells it, the highlight of this year's festivities is to be a delightful dessert commissioned by the ever-generous Master Gegeruju, and his colleagues would welcome the aid of an adventurer like yourself in preparing it. He invites you to speak with his colleague Haermaga should you be so inclined to join the effort.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESSUM701_04082_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Haermaga offers a hearty welcome, seemingly greatly relieved at your arrival. It would seem that preparations for the dessert Master Gegeruju has commissioned have hit an unfortunate snag─to wit, the ice that is to serve as the primary ingredient for the frosty delight is nowhere to be found. He encourages you to check in with his fellow faire attendant P'obyano and see what you might glean about its whereabouts.</target>

Commissioned to craft the most delicious frozen dessert the realm has ever seen, a renowned confectioner named Nekeke struck out to the northern seas in search of the finest ice in all Eorzea─and naught has been heard from her since. As P'obyano ponders what might have befallen her special guest, you are interrupted by a scream coming from the beach. The faire attendant confirms that it is none other than Nekeke who appears to be drowning in the water, and you quickly rush to the confectioner's aid.</target>

In retrieving a chunk of pristine ice from the harsh, snow-swept northern isles, it would appear that she inadvertently brought along with it a particularly blustery fiend that was responsible for sinking her ship, and now threatens to wreak havoc on the typically peaceful shores of Costa del Sol. P'obyano is quick to assure her, however, that you and your friends are more than up to the task of quelling this menace, and the two of you set off to consult with Haermaga about what might be done.</target>
