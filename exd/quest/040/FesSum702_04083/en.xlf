        <target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM702_04083_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Nekeke thanks you again for dispatching the Bombard menace she unwittingly brought upon Costa del Sol. Free to finally perform the duties for which she was summoned, she takes to the kitchen to begin work on her latest masterpiece. In the meantime, she encourages you to go for a stroll on the beach with P'obyano, as well as to share news of her progress with Master Gegeruju if you are so inclined.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Friends since childhood, the two have long looked up to adventurers─and in fact chose to pursue their current professions as a tribute to those like you who keep the people of Eorzea safe. The time having passed by in an instant, you suppose that Nekeke might be finished with her task.</target>
