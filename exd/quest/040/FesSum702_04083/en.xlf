				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESSUM702_04083_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Nekeke thanks you again for dispatching the Bombard menace she unwittingly brought upon Costa del Sol. Free to finally perform the duties for which she was summoned, she takes to the kitchen to begin work on her latest masterpiece. In the meantime, she encourages you to go for a stroll on the beach with P'obyano, as well as to share news of her progress with Master Gegeruju if you are so inclined.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Friends since childhood, the two have long looked up to adventurers─and in fact chose to pursue their current professions as a tribute to those like you who keep the people of Eorzea safe. The time having passed by in an instant, you suppose that Nekeke might be finished with her task.</target>

Waiting eagerly with your friends, you are swept away by the masterfully fashioned confection, as well as by the snow shower summoned from the skies somehow by Nekeke's frosty, fluffy companions─one of whom, surprisingly enough, seems determined to join you on your adventures. With all coming to a triumphant end, you wish Nekeke and your friends well and stride forth to enjoy the festivities as they commence in earnest.</target>
