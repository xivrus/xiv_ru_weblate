Amh Garanjy welcomes your generous offer of continued aid, and bids you assist with the latest task: to wit, seeing the Starlight Tree─the most recognizable symbol of the event─is ready for the festivities. The head celebrant bids you speak to her colleague for all the details.

At the celebrant's suggestion, make your way to the Carpenters' Guild to see if one of the artisans there might be able to lend their wisdom and talents to rectify the situation.</target>
