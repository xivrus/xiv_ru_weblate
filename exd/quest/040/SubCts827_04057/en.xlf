In typical extravagant fashion, he regales you with a tale told to him by a fellow traveler─of the legend of Landerwaffe, an ancient masterpiece of Allag which has hunted down through the ages for a suitable master. In light of your command of a multitude of gwibers, the minstrel seems convinced that the mechanical dragon will heed your call. With the instrument of its summoning in hand, you have only to blow a single shrill call from the deck of the Flagship.</target>
