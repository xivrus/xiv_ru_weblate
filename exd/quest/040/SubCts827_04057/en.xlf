In typical extravagant fashion, he regales you with a tale told to him by a fellow traveler─of the legend of Landerwaffe, an ancient masterpiece of Allag which has hunted down through the ages for a suitable master. In light of your command of a multitude of gwibers, the minstrel seems convinced that the mechanical dragon will heed your call. With the instrument of its summoning in hand, you have only to blow a single shrill call from the deck of the Flagship.</target>

The wandering minstrel is so moved by the sight that he composes a verse on the spot, immortalizing the moment in which machina and master stand poised to begin a whole new chapter of grand adventure. Even fate itself must bend before the mighty partnership of the Shadowmaker and the Dragon Made!</target>
