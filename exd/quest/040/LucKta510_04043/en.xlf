At the man's behest, you set out to find the third member of your little crew, a certain dwarf with a cheerfully pessimistic outlook on existence.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKTA510_04043_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The rebuilding effort requires much in the way of supplies and many willing hands, both of which are notably lacking in Komra at present. To overcome this problem, the dig site chief has come up with the idea of availing yourselves of the technology used by the machines. For your part in this plan, you are required to venture into the tunnels to gather items that may be of use, and bring them back to your dwarven associate for inspection. Thus begins the great endeavor to rebuild Komra and prove to one and all that naught can keep dwarves down─save perhaps copious amounts of grog.</target>
