It would seem the Telophoroi have marched straight through the Ixal's homeland, scattering all before them on their way to the Carteneau Flats. Wasting no time, the Elder Seedseer orders the Twin Adders to ready their airships, and bids you join them on their journey to the battlefield.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Outside the airship port, you are surprised to find Arenvald, whom Fordola has brought all the way from Ul'dah in the hope of speaking with Alphinaud. Your happiness soon gives way to shock, however, when you discover that the youth is now confined to a wheelchair due to the injuries he sustained in the tower at Paglth'an. Having apparently resigned himself to the fact that he can no longer join the other Scions on their adventures, he asks Alphinaud to fight on in his stead and be the hero that he cannot. While these well-meaning words only add to the─largely self-inflicted─weight of expectations with which Alphinaud has been struggling, he seems grateful for the encouragement with battle just around the corner.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Their numbers bolstered by tempered beastmen and lunar primals, the legions of the Telophoroi test the newly forged Grand Company of Eorzea to its breaking point. As you and your fellow Scions descend upon the field of combat, it becomes apparent that the enemy have set their sights on an aetherial confluence buried deep beneath the ground, though their true designs remain a mystery. Knowing only that they must be stopped, you divide your forces and engage a nigh-endless army of foes, drawing upon hitherto untapped reserves of strength, and succeed at length in driving the Telophoroi hordes from their prize.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Heart still pounding, you look up to the heavens to find Fandaniel staring down at you intently. Making light of his failure, he declares that while the day may be yours, your efforts have earned you no more than a brief stay of execution, and with that he takes his leave. Whether the Ascian is right only time will tell, but the fact remains that when tested, the Grand Company of Eorzea emerged unbroken, which is surely cause to celebrate in itself. You permit yourself a weary smile, and troop from the field. Soon after, a grateful Lord Aymeric offers to fly you and your comrades back to the Rising Stones─where it becomes clear he has much to discuss.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Reasoning that the Grand Company of Eorzea can be relied upon to keep the Telophoroi at bay, Lord Aymeric requests that the Scions search instead for a means to neutralize the threat of the towers. Given Sharlayan's preeminence in the field of aetherological research, it is agreed that the solution will most likely be found there; along, perhaps, with knowledge pertaining to the Final Days. Unfortunately, you will not be able to confirm your suspicions until Krile has obtained permission for you all to set foot in the infamously insular nation, and a long wait seems in prospect.

Sometime later, you accompany Y'shtola and the others on an expedition to investigate the mechanism by which the towers absorb aether, and learn to your dismay that they are draining the lifeblood of the land itself. As you grimly turn for home, you hear an ephemeral voice call out to you and you alone...

It warns that the end draws nigh...and that the fate of the star is in your hands.

※The next main scenario quest will be available from Alphinaud once you have met the following requirements:
※FINAL FANTASY XIV: Endwalker must be registered to your service account.
※You must have completed the main scenario quest “Death Unto Dawn.”</target>
