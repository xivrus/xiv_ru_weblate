As both the machines and the secrets of their construction are generally to be found within dwarven settlements exclusively, he has a sneaking suspicion that their sudden prevalence elsewhere has something to do with Konogg's departure from Komra. Eager for any chance of setting things right with the youth, he asks that you follow this trail and see if it leads to Konogg.</target>

Alas, when you arrive, Konogg is no longer to be found within. Perhaps he departed with Anogg, but whence, who can say...</target>

He further muses that to err is inevitable─a fact with which you, too, must make peace.</target>
