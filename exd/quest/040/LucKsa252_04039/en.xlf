        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKSA252_04039_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;On the surface, Gerolt's plan is seemingly simple─a more selective use of crystallized memories to better align with your preferred style of combat. However, the means to analyze the aetherial properties of these memories yet eludes him. Enter Regana, accompanied by an Allagan node commissioned from Garlond Ironworks designed to do precisely that. Though daunted by the potential ramifications of accepting further help─financial or otherwise─Zlatan can see no other way to proceed with Gerolt's plan. As Regana explains, the node will use gathered memories to create a registry with which you can modify the Resistance weapon as you see fit. Hoping for an adequate sample size, Gerolt suggests searching for two types of memories, eighteen of each.

※Memories of the dying can be found from certain FATEs and alliance raids.
※Haunting memories of the dying can be found from FATEs in the Gyr Abania region, or the Shadow of Mhach alliance raids.
※Vexatious memories of the dying can be found from FATEs in the Far East region, or the Return to Ivalice alliance raids.</target>

When you offer up your Resistance weapon, however, it warns of aetheric instability, and the near-certain corruption of your weapon should you proceed. Zlatan believes the solution to this problem lies in the crystal foci, which used a sealant of heated aetherial siltstone to ensure its stability. Regana notes there was a time when pottery made from this stone could be found in all corners of the realm, suggesting the ruins of Bozja may not be the only place where they can be found. Of course, there is only one among you capable of scouring such dark depths.</target>
