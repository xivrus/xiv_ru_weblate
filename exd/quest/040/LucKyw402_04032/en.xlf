Cid brings her out from the infirmary and all present are taken aback to see that she is but a shell of her former self, utterly unresponsive and incapable of even the most basic communication. According to Cid, the trauma from which she is suffering is not the result of the synthetic auracite system, but more likely caused by learning of the terrible fate that befell her brother Alfonse. Gaius reaffirms his desire to fulfill his promise to Alfonse by overseeing the restoration of Werlyt as an independent state.
