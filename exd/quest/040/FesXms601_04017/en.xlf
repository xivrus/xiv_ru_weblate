        <target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS601_04017_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Amh Garanjy greets you with a smile, heartened by your arrival. It would seem the ever-unflappable Starlight celebrant has been plagued by more trouble than usual in preparing for this year's festivities─such that the celebration itself is in peril if she cannot secure a capable helping hand, and quickly. Further complicating matters is the presence of Kamlito Halito, son of a prominent merchant from Ul'dah, who has been sent by his father to observe the festivities, but appears to believe himself above it all. Nonetheless, the presence of the Saint of Nymeia is evidence enough that a miracle or two may lie in your future. Should you be willing to lend your aid, you need only speak to her saturnine colleague by the waterwheel storage cabin.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
