Using the calculating power of a magitek terminal, he succeeds in identifying the late Owen's password, and you watch intently as the Allagan technologist appears in holographic form and explains the mechanism by which eikons make thralls of men. It is duly confirmed that, like those corrupted by Light, the souls of the tempered are subject to stagnation. &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Unlike&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; with the victims of the sin eaters, however, you learn that one cannot reanimate a tempered soul without also intensifying the victim's fanatical faith.
