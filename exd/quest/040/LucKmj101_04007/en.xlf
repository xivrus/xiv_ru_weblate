Midway through the meeting, Lyse arrives unannounced, and you all enjoy the happiest of reunions. Belatedly recalling the purpose of her visit, your old friend reports that civil war has broken out in the Empire, and invites you to an Alliance council in Ala Mhigo. While the others agree to travel to Gyr Abania, you and G'raha Tia opt to assist Alisaie in her quest to find a cure for tempering.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKMJ101_04007_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Wishing above all else to save the young kobold Ga Bu, Alisaie is hopeful that the treatment used to help those corrupted by sin eaters might also prove effective on the tempered. Before putting this theory to the proof, however, she would learn all she can of the condition. G'raha Tia suggests looking to Allagan wisdom, and that no place is more likely to have the answers you seek than the Aetherochemical Research Facility on Azys Lla. At Alisaie's mention of the need for an airship, Tataru smugly instructs you to meet her at the northern bank of Silvertear Lake, prepared to travel.</target>
