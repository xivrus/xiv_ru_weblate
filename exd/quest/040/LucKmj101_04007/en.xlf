Belatedly recalling the purpose of her visit, your old friend reports that civil war has broken out in the Empire, and invites you to an Alliance council in Ala Mhigo.

Before putting this theory to the proof, however, she would learn all she can of the condition. G'raha Tia suggests looking to Allagan wisdom, and that no place is more likely to have the answers you seek than the Aetherochemical Research Facility on Azys Lla.
