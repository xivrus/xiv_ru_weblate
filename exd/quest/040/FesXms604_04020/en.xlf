Your task, if you choose to accept it: help ensure that the delightfully decorative snowmen adorning the town stay intact until the season has come and gone. You strike off to hear the details of the task from the less animated of the chief celebrant's associates.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Bidding you to attend to the snowmen on the way to the manor district to the north, he sets off with young Isainne to see to the remaining ones.</target>

As she rushes off to tackle her next task, your mind inexplicably turns to your colleague Kamlito Halito. Head back to the amphitheatre and see whether or not the spirit of the season has truly taken hold in the young man's heart.</target>
