Your task, if you choose to accept it: help ensure that the delightfully decorative snowmen adorning the town stay intact until the season has come and gone. You strike off to hear the details of the task from the less animated of the chief celebrant's associates.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
