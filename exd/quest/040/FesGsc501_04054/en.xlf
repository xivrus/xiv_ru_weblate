As the Gold Saucer attendant tells it, a robbery has taken place, and one of his closest friends and colleagues has been unfairly named the primary suspect. Feeling pity for the man, you agree to accompany him to the Manderville Lounge, that he might fill you in on the details.

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESGSC501_04054_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;At the lounge, Ollier apprises you of the specifics regarding the incident at hand. It would seem his friend, a man named Hugue, has come under suspicion primarily for his proximity to the scene of the crime, as well as a blemish on his record from when he committed an act of petty theft some years ago. Ollier, however, remains convinced that the true culprit is to be found elsewhere. Swayed by his words─and with the blessing of Master Roland─you agree to conduct an investigation of your own in hopes of getting at the truth of the matter.</target>

He then suggests that you might begin your effort by speaking to a nearby attendant who, at a glance, appears visibly apprehensive about something or other.</target>
