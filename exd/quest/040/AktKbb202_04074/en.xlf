        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBB202_04074_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;The deed is done, and Drusilla is impressed. She shares with you the story of how reapers came to be─how when driven from their ancestral homeland by invaders, her Garlean forebears were forced to turn to pacts with fell voidsent in order to survive. Although the strength they gained was great, it came at cost and with risks, but such were the depths of their desperation. She leaves you to think upon the lesson of this tale and asks you to return to Lemures headquarters at your leisure.

※In the event that you leave Lemures headquarters, you may re-enter by speaking with the loyal Lemure in Pearl Lane.</target>

She encourages you to think about their perspective, but reminds you that regardless of whether or not you sympathize with them and their plight, she expects you to spare no effort in the pursuit of your prey. She and the other Lemures will be gathering information on the voidsent's whereabouts. In the meantime, Drusilla asks that you hone your skills until further information is uncovered.

※The next reaper quest will be available from Drusilla upon reaching level 73.</target>
