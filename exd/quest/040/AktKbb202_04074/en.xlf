Although the strength they gained was great, it came at cost and with risks, but such were the depths of their desperation. She leaves you to think upon the lesson of this tale and asks you to return to Lemures headquarters at your leisure.

She and the other Lemures will be gathering information on the voidsent's whereabouts. In the meantime, Drusilla asks that you hone your skills until further information is uncovered.
