Without a word, Drusilla departs for Erralig's Burial Chamber, leaving her family without a leader. It falls to you to follow, and remind her of the duty she owes to those who yet live.</target>

In the face of Drusilla's anger, he agrees to forgo custom─though upon viewing the remains of her comrade, she forbids you from doing the same. Her rage seemingly spent, the reaper explains that there is someone to whom she must speak before returning to headquarters. You are invited to accompany her to Stonesthrow, provided you do so in silence.</target>

Though the woman weeps for him, she speaks with no hint of reproach toward her husband's leader, asking only that he be avenged. Before returning to headquarters, Drusilla requests a word with you out of sight of prying eyes.</target>

As you express the same, you feel a shiver run down your spine, and turn to see a man with pale skin and sanguine eyes─Orcus himself. Drusilla seizes the opportunity to strike, but Orcus dodges her blow with ease, before fixing you with a ravenous gaze. The slavering fiend describes your soul in uncomfortable detail, proclaiming it the most delicious he has ever seen. Upon declaring his intent to see it suffused with terror and hatred ere he returns to feast, the voidsent vanishes, leaving you and Drusilla alone on the bridge.</target>

The reaper further explains that Orcus feasts on the souls of those that he kills, absorbing their aether to sate his endless appetite. Although Drusilla is unsure how to proceed, she warns you to take special care as you go about your affairs, for Orcus may be lurking around any corner.

※The next reaper quest will be available from Drusilla upon reaching level 78.</target>
