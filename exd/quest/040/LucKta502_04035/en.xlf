Though Anogg─or the girl you have known as Anogg, at least─rushes in with 2B and 9S and urges you to destroy the sphere, it is already too late. A pale and foreboding tower grows before your very eyes, spiraling up to the heavens.

Though you narrowly prevent it from claiming dominion over this world, the portal in the sky that heralded its advent remains despite your android companions' best efforts. Only Anogg's intervention sees it closed at last, as she passes through and closes the gate from the other side─leaving you with naught more than a simple letter by which to answer Konogg's inevitable questions.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKTA502_04035_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;The portal now sealed for good, you take in your surroundings, and find the unmoving shells of 2B and 9S.
