Seeking to ensure that his employer lives through the encounter, the attendant has asked you to meet them at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, implying that a handsome reward lies at the end of a day's work.</target>

Clearly, Jijilyo neglected to divulge that he had previously hired the gang to frighten his competition. The standoff turns tense, but as the woman looks you over she is struck with an idea: in exchange for your release into her group's service, she will forgive Jijilyo's debt. Treasuring his own life and not particularly caring about yours, Jijilyo readily agrees, and the Reaper informs you that she will be waiting at Lemures headquarters, located in Pearl Lane.</target>

This is no simple task, however, and will require that you undergo training as a reaper. To that end, Drusilla asks you to touch the soul crystal on her desk, and a dark figure materializes─your avatar, the source of a reaper's power. To claim these otherworldly abilities, you must first forge a pact to feed the souls of your enemies to this avatar─or rather, the voidsent it represents. Drusilla emphasizes that the choice to do so and join the Lemures is not one to be made lightly, and offers you some time to decide.</target>
