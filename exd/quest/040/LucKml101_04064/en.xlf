No sooner have you exchanged greetings than an envoy arrives with a message from the Alliance. Apparently, a historic assembly will shortly be taking place in Ala Mhigo, and the Scions' presence is requested. In addition to the usual Alliance representatives, delegates from the various beast tribes have been invited to attend, in the hope that all the peoples of Eorzea might unite under a single banner.</target>

The talks culminate in the founding of the Grand Company of Eorzea, a dream long nurtured by Alphinaud in particular.</target>

As traders in crystal, they are well versed in negotiating with the many and varied peoples of Eorzea, and their counsel should be greatly beneficial to the newly formed coalition. Alphinaud also wishes to take this opportunity to draft a proposal based on his experiences as commander of the Crystal Braves, and offer it to the Grand Company of Eorzea that it may avoid a similar fate.</target>
