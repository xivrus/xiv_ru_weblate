        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBB121_04070_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Though Lalah had assumed that Loifa and his companions were criminals, she is increasingly of the belief that they may instead be victims seeking revenge. Her suspicions are also supported by the fact that, in response to her reports, authorities in Sharlayan reopened their investigation into the rumors of a mad healer who conducted heinous procedures...and confirmed that there was truth to them after all. Moreover, a sage named Guildivain─the man who took Mahaud and Ancel into his care─disappeared from Sharlayan shortly before the fugitives first appeared. On the assumption that Guildivain and the villainous healer are one and the same, and that he has since assumed the guise of Faldrinet, Lalah decides to confront the man. Thus do you set forth for Aleport to seek out the merchant he frequents.</target>

Though Loifa may still be saved, Lalah hesitates─for it was her mother who died at the hands of his accomplice. At your words, however, she recognizes that there can be no justice without knowing the whole truth, and bids you render aid to the ailing Viera.</target>

As he did with Mahaud and Ancel, the man lured Loifa away with the promise of a cure for his illness, only to use him as a subject in his twisted experiments. When his crimes were about to be exposed, he fled to Eorzea and continued masquerading as a kind-hearted healer. The three companions had been pursuing him, but found themselves thwarted by you and Lalah at every turn. And now, the villain has spirited Mahaud and Ancel away again. Wishing to save his friends but knowing he cannot do so alone, Loifa tearfully beseeches your help.</target>

As Loifa ponders the purpose of the power he has been given, you continue working to improve your mastery over your own.
