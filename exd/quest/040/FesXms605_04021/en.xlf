As the next order of the day, Amh Garanjy would task her favorite helper with replenishing the supply of seasonal wreaths, which is already running dangerously short of demand. Speak with the chief celebrant's passionate colleague to see how you might serve to that end.

Your rejoicing is interrupted, however, when you overhear the conversation of a mother and son passing by alluding to Isainne having troubles at home.

Almost immediately, you are joined by Kamlito Halito, who seems to have taken his passion for snowman-building to still greater extremes, and shortly after that by none other than the Saint of Nymeia himself. After expressing his admiration for his young charge and the genuine passion with which he now pursues his Starlight preparations, he sheds light on the concerning situation surrounding Isainne. As he tells it, the girl's father is gravely ill, forcing the child to spend her days working to save up coin for a remedy─one so rare that it is all but impossible to come by even for those few who could afford it. As the saint and Kamlito muse as to what might be done to bring succor to Isainne's family, all of you agree that you must strive to do all that you can in the moment to see that the girl's Starlight is a truly special one.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with the splendiferous Starlight celebrant.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Speak with the beneficent botanist.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Deliver the wreath to the splendiferous Starlight celebrant.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="27" approved="yes"><source>27</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_TODO_03&lt;tab&gt;Report to Amh Garanjy and open the twinklebox.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_KAMLITOHALITO_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Just you wait─my latest snowman is certain to be an artistic masterwork the likes of which Gridania has never seen!
