        <target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS605_04021_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Thanks in no small part to your own efforts, preparations for the Starlight Celebration are proceeding apace, but there is still much that needs be done before the festivities can commence in earnest. As the next order of the day, Amh Garanjy would task her favorite helper with replenishing the supply of seasonal wreaths, which is already running dangerously short of demand. Speak with the chief celebrant's passionate colleague to see how you might serve to that end.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Make for the Botanists' Guild in her stead and procure the much-needed goods, that no doorway in Gridania might go unadorned this Starlight. </target>

Almost immediately, you are joined by Kamlito Halito, who seems to have taken his passion for snowman-building to still greater extremes, and shortly after that by none other than the Saint of Nymeia himself. After expressing his admiration for his young charge and the genuine passion with which he now pursues his Starlight preparations, he sheds light on the concerning situation surrounding Isainne. As he tells it, the girl's father is gravely ill, forcing the child to spend her days working to save up coin for a remedy─one so rare that it is all but impossible to come by even for those few who could afford it. As the saint and Kamlito muse as to what might be done to bring succor to Isainne's family, all of you agree that you must strive to do all that you can in the moment to see that the girl's Starlight is a truly special one.</target>
