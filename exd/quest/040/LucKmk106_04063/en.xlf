At this, Estinien interjects that those who uphold such ideals are the ones remembered as heroes. Alas, his words seem to fall on deaf ears.</target>

You duly learn that a creature resembling Ifrit was waiting for them inside the tower, and that further such entities have been sighted in the vicinity of other towers across the realm. Anticipating your response to these grim tidings, Nanamo assures you that the Grand Companies are ready to deal with the threat, and bids you take the opportunity to recuperate from your recent exertions.</target>

The surprises do not end there, however. Krile also reveals that the investigation she recently conducted alongside Y'shtola concerned the apparent lack of communication between Hydaelyn and Her chosen champion─you. This, she declares, is another question to which she hopes to find answers during her trip. Acknowledging that her departure will leave the Scions a member short, however, she turns at last to Estinien, and invites him once more to join the cause. And, perhaps most surprisingly of all, he accepts.</target>
