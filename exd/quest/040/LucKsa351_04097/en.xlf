        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKSA351_04097_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;As Zlatan explains, the House of Splendors has reached an agreement with goblin metalworkers in Idyllshire to supply the Resistance with the reagent needed to refine your weapon. In exchange, you have been asked to provide two varieties of mechanical parts─compact axles and springs, thirty of each.

※Mechanical parts can be obtained by participating in skirmishes and critical engagements in Zadnor, as well as any of the normal Alexander 8-man raids. The Unrestricted Party option cannot be enabled when clearing the aforementioned duties.</target>

With the transaction concluded, she takes her leave, but not before proposing an extended contract for additional shipments of reagent. Gerolt promptly refuses, but Seika appears unperturbed by the rejection. This reaction leaves Zlatan wondering if there was more to her proposal than meets the eye.</target>
