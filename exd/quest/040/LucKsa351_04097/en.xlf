In exchange, you have been asked to provide two varieties of mechanical parts─compact axles and springs, thirty of each.

※Mechanical parts can be obtained by participating in skirmishes and critical engagements in Zadnor, as well as any of the normal Alexander 8-man raids. The Unrestricted Party option cannot be enabled when clearing the aforementioned duties.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKSA351_04097_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You return with an assortment of mechanical parts, and after verifying everything is accounted for, Regana's colleague, Seika, hands over the reagent. With the transaction concluded, she takes her leave, but not before proposing an extended contract for additional shipments of reagent. Gerolt promptly refuses, but Seika appears unperturbed by the rejection.
