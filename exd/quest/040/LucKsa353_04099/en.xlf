				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKSA353_04099_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Based on the techniques used to create materia, the House of Splendors has devised an incantation that can commit the energies of emotion to the Resistance weapon. For ease of use─or perhaps ease of profit─the spell has been penned to magicked scrolls, and the House has asked you supply them with memories of the dying in exchange. Zlatan forgoes explanations of the crystallized memories and tells you only that two varieties of memory are required, thirty of each.

※Memories of the dying can be obtained by participating in skirmishes and critical engagements in Zadnor, as well as any of the normal Eden 8-man raids. The Unrestricted Party option cannot be enabled when clearing the aforementioned duties.</target>

The transaction is carried out as arranged, but before Regana's associate leaves, she takes a moment to offer Gerolt an additional contract for larger shipments of magicked scrolls. Much to Zlatan's surprise, the attendant is strangely composed when the offer is rejected. As she turns to leave, you find yourself another step closer to refining your Resistance weapon.</target>
