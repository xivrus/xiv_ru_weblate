The Resistance manages to corner Misija who is unable to summon Queen Gunnhildr to battle. What Mikoto failed to see, however, is that this was all according to Misija's plan, for she too can now peer into the future. Imperial enforcements soon arrive, and a terrible battle ensues there in the ruins.</target>
