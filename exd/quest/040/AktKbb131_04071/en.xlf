While awaiting further developments, she asks that you continue your training by lending a helping hand to the locals. Restless, Loifa offers to accompany you, and Lalah gives her blessing, seeing it as an opportunity for you to learn from a fellow sage. Together you seek out Midnight Dew to inquire after treasure hunters who may be in need of assistance.</target>

Once back on his feet, the man offers Loifa his heartfelt gratitude─an act which spurs the young Viera to reflect upon his sage's power. Before meeting you and Lalah, he had no purpose for it except revenge. But having come to realize that Lalah's mother saw in him the potential to become a saver of lives, he swears to use his power only to protect his friends. Satisfied with your efforts, the two of you make your way back to Idyllshire to rejoin Lalah.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBB131_04071_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;The hunt for Guildivain has been productive; with the aid of a fellow operative, Lalah has identified a cave in the Dravanian forelands as the villain's base of operations. Additionally, you have learned that the death of Guildivain's wife may have triggered his descent into madness. Yet whether or not he is to be pitied, the man cannot be permitted to continue his depraved experiments. In preparation for the impending confrontation, Lalah reveals that she is working on a countermeasure, and asks for your patience and faith until such time as all is in readiness.

※The next sage quest will be available from Lalah Jinjahl upon reaching level 80.</target>
