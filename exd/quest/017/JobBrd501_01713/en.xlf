By taking an interest in the development of the younger generation, he feels that his songs have gained in power, and believes that yours could, too. If you have a mind to rise to new heights as a bard, accept Jehantel's invitation and go to Quiver's Hold, where you will be introduced to his acquaintance.</target>

Though he is a lancer by training, Sanson believes in the power of song, and is seeking to establish a new unit which incorporates bards. To his frustration, however, thus far the leaders of the Gods' Quiver have not been amenable to his requests for cooperation. Presently, he will meet with them again, and hopes to sway them with the existence of a legendary song said to hold the power to bring battles to a decisive end: the Ballad of Oblivion. Make your way to the Seat of the First Bow and be present for the meeting.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBBRD501_01713_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The meeting does not proceed as well as Sanson had hoped. The Gods' Quiver are still unwilling to lend their cooperation, though Lewin allows that he is intrigued by the Ballad of Oblivion. Sanson declares his intent to go on a journey to find this song, but even this endeavor is met with opposition. The leader of the Gold Bull unit─a man who does not think highly of bards─assigns Sanson a trial to test his fitness to embark on his proposed expedition: culling enraged treants in the East Shroud. In this manner, the meeting comes to an end. Speak with Jehantel to hear his thoughts on the trial.</target>

Introducing himself as Guydelot, the cocksure fellow is revealed to be the bard assigned to your expedition and one of Jehantel's students. Yet in spite of Guydelot's ability, Sanson is unconvinced of his suitability, and makes his displeasure towards the man abundantly clear.
