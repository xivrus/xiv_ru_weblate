As is custom in Ishgard, the newly married Joye has resigned from her duties at both the manor and the workshop, leaving Stephanivien and her colleagues short a talented machinist. In the event that Joye does not return, you must train with renewed intensity to fill the void left by her departure.

※The next machinist quest will be available from Stephanivien upon reaching level 52.</target>
