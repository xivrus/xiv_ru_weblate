As she tells it, she and Lord Emmanellain have known one another since childhood. Though he is a man grown, his behavior can still be childish at times.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ018_01743_LANIAITTE_000_024&lt;tab&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for Torsefers. No doubt he asked you to come in his place. I can sympathize with his anxiety over upsetting Lord Emmanellain, but this is no way to treat a guest. Please accept this as a token of my apology. I realize it's not much, but it is all I can offer at present.</target>
