        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBRD580_01717_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;As promised, Sylviel has looked into the Coerthan legend pertaining to a saint of song in the heavens. Alas, the information he provided is not as promising as Sanson had hoped, with “the heavens” most likely referring to a natural phenomenon, as Guydelot had suspected. Just when Sanson resigns himself to accepting that the legend is a dead end, you reveal to him the existence of a tribe of moogles in the Churning Mists. The revelation spurs him to continue his mission, and he begs you to show him to Moghome. Before striking out, he bids you leave a message with Sylviel for Guydelot, in the hopes that the wayward bard will rejoin you later.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBRD580_01717_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;To your surprise, you find Sylviel conversing with Guydelot, who apparently has been watching you and Sanson from afar. Upon hearing of the moogles of Moghome, Sylviel concedes that the legend may in fact be referring to the creatures, and urges Guydelot to settle his differences with Sanson and accompany him to the Churning Mists. For now, however, a promise to think on it is the best the bard can offer. Your message thus delivered, make your way to Anyx Trine and rejoin Sanson.</target>
