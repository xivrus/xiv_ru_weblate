A short while ago, one of the workers from House Dzemael asked me to go and deal with some mylodons that have been causing trouble.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ019_01744_INGARET_000_001&lt;tab&gt;The Black Iron Bridge barely survived the Calamity. It's in desperate need of repairs, but the upland mylodons roam far too close to it─the craftsmen can't work safely. Someone needs to kill them... The mylodons, that is! Not the craftsmen!
I'd ask the dragoons to do it, but they're so busy it'd be weeks before they found the time. I'd do it myself, but there're so many of the beasts that I fear I'd be swarmed and outnumbered.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="50" approved="yes"><source>50</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ019_01744_INGARET_000_002&lt;tab&gt;You're a capable &lt;var 08 E905 ((woman)) ((man)) /var&gt;.
