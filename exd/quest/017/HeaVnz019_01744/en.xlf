The bridge needs repairs, but the craftsmen cannot work safely when there are monsters within pouncing distance. Ingaret is not confident that she can take on so many beasts at once, so kill three of the monsters and she will finish off the rest.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ019_01744_INGARET_000_001&lt;tab&gt;The Black Iron Bridge barely survived the Calamity. It's in desperate need of repairs, but the upland mylodons roam far too close to it─the craftsmen can't work safely. Someone needs to kill them... The mylodons, that is! Not the craftsmen!
I'd ask the dragoons to do it, but they're so busy it'd be weeks before they found the time. I'd do it myself, but there're so many of the beasts that I fear I'd be swarmed and outnumbered.</target>
