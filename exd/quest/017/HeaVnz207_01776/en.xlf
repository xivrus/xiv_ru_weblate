He suggests that such an easy mark would make the ideal first catch for the novice hunter Q'yantaa. Speak to her and see if she has any ideas regarding catching the bird.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Q'yantaa's informed hunting strategy is to set up traps to the north of Tailfeather instead of the south, outwitting all of the other hunters. It becomes clear that while inexperienced, and sometimes over-enthusiastic, Q'yantaa does possess some measure of hunting instinct. Place her special concoction─some very fragrant gysahl greens─at the designated area to see if Q'yantaa's instincts bear any reward.</target>

Lucky for us, though, I've thought one step ahead.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ207_01776_QYANTAA_000_013&lt;tab&gt;You see, since so many hunters've been down south, their scent'll be as plain to the bird as this mushroom's is to us. Now if &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;I&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; was a chocobo, I'd steer well clear of that place.</target>

Now, if my instincts're right, that chocobo'll go right through bandersnatch territory. That's why we gotta set up &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;our&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; traps to the north.
