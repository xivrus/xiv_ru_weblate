A creature that nests near Gorgagne Mills, the blackblood zu, eats this same toxic plant. Whatever grants the zu immunity to the thorny viper may hold the key to creating an antidote to the dragon poison ultimately stemming from the same root. Sigan provides you with an ember and some fragrant herbs. Travel to Gorgagne Mills, use the herbs to lure the zu from its nest, and retrieve its blood.</target>
