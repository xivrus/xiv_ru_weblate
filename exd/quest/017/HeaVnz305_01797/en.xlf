You might think that's a common story, what with all the huntin' we do, but I'm told this one was unnaturally big.

Might be that this chocobo is takin' some kind of revenge on us hunters, an' these acts are a means of provokin' us. By all accounts, this chocobo is stronger an' more clever than the rest. I expect capturin' it won't be a simple feat.</target>
