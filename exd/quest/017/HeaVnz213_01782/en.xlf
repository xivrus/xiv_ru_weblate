        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ213_01782_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Taking the previous two failures to heart, Loupard has decided to try a different approach in the search for Q'yantaa's partner. He bids her introduce herself to an experienced hunter by the name of Hudde, and she rushes off, eager to elevate her hunting career. The unpleasant experience with Bauricoin is still fresh in Loupard's mind, and he asks you to look after Q'yantaa until this new partnership is solidified. Find Hudde in the north part of Tailfeather to see how the two are getting on.</target>

Q'yantaa, as always, looks like she may have a plan to get what she wants. Speak with her to find out what she means to do.</target>
