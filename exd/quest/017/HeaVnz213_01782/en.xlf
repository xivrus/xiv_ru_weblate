He bids her introduce herself to an experienced hunter by the name of Hudde, and she rushes off, eager to elevate her hunting career. The unpleasant experience with Bauricoin is still fresh in Loupard's mind, and he asks you to look after Q'yantaa until this new partnership is solidified. Find Hudde in the north part of Tailfeather to see how the two are getting on.</target>
