With the favor of the Holy See riding on its outcome, the competition promises to be fierce indeed, and the chief machinist hints at several strategies he would like to practice. Remain behind and speak with Stephanivien, while Rostnsthal and Joye prepare for the training session in Bloodshore.</target>
