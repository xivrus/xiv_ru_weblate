        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ120_01769_DOMINIAC_000_202&lt;tab&gt;Thank you, not just for the inspiration you provided Saintrelmaux, but for the invaluable assistance you provided in helping my plan come to fruition. If things continue to progress this well, we may catch ourselves a dragon yet greater still than this wyvern.</target>

When other young men hear of his exploits, they'll be eager to rally to Aymeric's cause and fight under his banner.</target>

But somehow I get the feeling that you're not the kind to settle down in one place─much less somewhere as remote and isolated as the Convictory. Still, I hope that you'll continue to lend us your strength from time to time.</target>
