Consequently, the creatures nearby were driven into a frenzy once more, and they reportedly attacked a knight on patrol. Though the man managed to flee to the Convictory, he has suffered grievous wounds. And to compound matters, all of the camp's chirurgeons are afield and cannot readily return. Eschiva believes that you are his only chance for survival; do as she bids and make haste to the Convictory.</target>

Convinced that Alaqa is somehow connected to the taint, Eschiva declares her intent to track her down.
