You see, last night, I was takin' a stroll after a few pints, and stumbled on some ominous-lookin' ruins. 'Course ruins are pretty common 'round here, but what I saw ain't: dragons!</target>

Two of them, with great big wings and fire in their eyes. I ran straight home at the sight of them. My memory's a bit hazy, but if it really &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;was&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; dragons I seen, we could all be in danger. I can't very well go back there by myself, but, well...
I almost hate to ask, but do you think you could traipse on over to the ruins for me? I'll mark down the area I was wanderin' around in on your map.</target>
