To achieve this goal, he means to slay a dragon together with his men. This plan will fall through, however, if no dragons can be found in the area. Still waiting to be relieved from sentry duty, he asks that you gather information from the guards about Camp Cloudtop. Speak with the guards, then venture off in search of his prey.</target>
