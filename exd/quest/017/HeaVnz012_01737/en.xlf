He tells you how his family made it for him from an ice crystal. Realizing that the freezing Coerthan snowdrifts are hardly the ideal place to carry ice crystals on one's person, he decides to leave the talisman in the barracks next time he goes on duty.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_HEAVNZ012_01737_SOLDIER01737_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Gods be cursed! Mere moments ago I was mobbed by a huge swarm of frost grenades. I made away with my life, but dropped my magic talisman in the confusion. It was a gift from my family, but the instant those monsters saw it, they lost all interest in me─they tore the thing apart and fled with the pieces!</target>

I have to get it back, but I can't leave my post. Hmmm...you strike me as quite the capable sort. Be a good &lt;var 08 E905 ((lass)) ((lad)) /var&gt; and recover it for me, would you?</target>

I didn't see which of the beasts nabbed the pieces, mind you. I was more concerned with escaping before they regained their interest in me. But please, slay the frost grenades and recover my talisman for me!</target>

My family made the talisman from an ice crystal. It was meant to protect me, but to be honest, there's more than enough cold around here without me carrying this thing. Still, it carries no small amount of sentimental value for me.</target>
