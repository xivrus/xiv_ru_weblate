Though the Convictors slay dragons, Jantellot recommends a warm-up before confronting the Dravanian Horde itself. He suggests hunting rheums instead. Locate and slay three rheums.</target>

See for yourself what life is like for us Convictors.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_HEAVNZ111_01760_JANTELLOT_000_001&lt;tab&gt;The Dravanian Horde is stronger than you might expect. Unless you've been at it for years─like I have─I think it prudent to start with something simple and then work your way up to dragons. I suggest rheums. Slay three of those, then come back here. Consider it a warm-up!</target>

Clearly the Azure Dragoon doesn't travel with mere amateurs. It sounds like those rheums barely put up enough of a fight to be considered a proper warm-up!</target>
