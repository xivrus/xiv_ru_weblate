Though the Convictors slay dragons, Jantellot recommends a warm-up before confronting the Dravanian Horde itself. He suggests hunting rheums instead. Locate and slay three rheums.</target>

You're the &lt;var 08 E905 ((lass)) ((lad)) /var&gt; who was in the Azure Dragoon's company! Since you are here anyway, perhaps you might like to try your hand at a spot of hunting before you depart? See for yourself what life is like for us Convictors.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ111_01760_JANTELLOT_000_001&lt;tab&gt;The Dravanian Horde is stronger than you might expect. Unless you've been at it for years─like I have─I think it prudent to start with something simple and then work your way up to dragons. I suggest rheums. Slay three of those, then come back here. Consider it a warm-up!</target>
