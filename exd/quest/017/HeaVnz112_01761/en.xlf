        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ112_01761_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In light of how easily you dispatched the rheums he previously tasked you with, Jantellot proposes that you hunt down some actual dragons this time. Archaeornis make up the vanguard of the Dravanian Horde, and a number of them roam the snowdrifts to the north of the camp, near Banepool. Jantellot tells you to find and slay three of these scaly, feathered beasts.</target>

They are always in need of more good men and women.</target>

If you're out of your depth, there's no shame in admitting it. I've no desire to send a good &lt;var 08 E905 ((woman)) ((man)) /var&gt; to &lt;var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var&gt; death.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ112_01761_JANTELLOT_000_032&lt;tab&gt;Many Ishgardians think we nobles at the Convictory are simply here out of foppery and whim. They scarce understand the risks we take defending Ishgard from the Horde. But I feel perhaps that you understand... If ever you decide you want to join the Convictors, you need but say the word!</target>
