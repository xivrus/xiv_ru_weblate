After Hudde finishes his tale, Q'yantaa restates her desire to learn the ways of hunting under Hudde's tutelage, and ensures him that she will not meet the same fate as Hudde's previous partner. Hudde, moved by the strength of her conviction, finally agrees to take her under his wing, but warns that being his partner will be far from easy.
