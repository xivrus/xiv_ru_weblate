        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ214_01783_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;Your inspection of the Dravanian lily is interrupted by Hudde, who is surprised that Q'yantaa was able to track him down despite the efforts he made to hide his tracks. However, he remains adamant that Q'yantaa is unfit to be his partner. After she prods him for an explanation, Hudde relates to you the tragic story of his previous partner, who died at these selfsame ruins during a routine hunt. After Hudde finishes his tale, Q'yantaa restates her desire to learn the ways of hunting under Hudde's tutelage, and ensures him that she will not meet the same fate as Hudde's previous partner. Hudde, moved by the strength of her conviction, finally agrees to take her under his wing, but warns that being his partner will be far from easy. Hudde and Q'yantaa return to Tailfeather to make preparations for their first hunt together. Bring news of this new partnership to Loupard.</target>
