As a gesture of gratitude, the scholar promises to investigate the legend further. And though Sanson is hopeful that this will lead you to the Ballad of Oblivion, Guydelot is not wholly convinced. The two exchange heated words, and Guydelot subsequently storms out of the settlement. Sanson believes that the bard will eventually come around, and asks for your patience in the meantime.
