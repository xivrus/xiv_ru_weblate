With the denizens of Tailfeather unwilling to help, it falls to you to mount a rescue. First, Sanson suggests that you scout out the entrance to the stronghold of Loth ast Gnath.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBRD560_01716_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;According to Sylviel, Coerthan legend speaks of a saint of song in the heavens─an individual with transcendent mastery over poetry and verse─who can bring a battle to its conclusion with a song. As a gesture of gratitude, the scholar promises to investigate the legend further. And though Sanson is hopeful that this will lead you to the Ballad of Oblivion, Guydelot is not wholly convinced. The two exchange heated words, and Guydelot subsequently storms out of the settlement. Sanson believes that the bard will eventually come around, and asks for your patience in the meantime.

※The next bard quest will be available from Sanson upon reaching level 58.</target>
