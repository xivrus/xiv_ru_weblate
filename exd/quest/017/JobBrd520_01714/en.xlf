Apparently, a local maiden ruffled his bard's pride when she told him that her sweetheart is fairer of voice than he is, and he has impulsively left the city in order to settle matters with the man─a knight of Ishgard. Sanson bids you come with him to Falcon's Nest, that you might stop Guydelot from doing something regrettable.</target>

Deeply grateful, the knight, Ser Alamenain, offers to assist in your search for the Ballad of Oblivion. He tells you of a woman who is said to send souls unto the heavens with a song, and believes that this song may be what you seek. With matters now settled after a fashion, make your way back to Falcon's Nest and rejoin Sanson.</target>
