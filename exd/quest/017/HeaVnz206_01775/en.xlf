Among many other facts, you learn that the prospect of a quick fortune brings many inexperienced hunters to Tailfeather in hopes of joining in on the lucrative chocobo hunting trade. He introduces you to Q'yantaa, a young Miqo'te who wishes to fill her pockets in the Dravanian forelands. Loupard's explanation turns into a request when he explains to you that she is in need of a partner, entrusting you with the care of the fledgling hunter until he can find someone willing to team up with her. Speak to Q'yantaa to hear her plan and judge whether or not she has a hunter's instincts.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_HEAVNZ206_01775_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Q'yantaa, while inexperienced, already has a plan to catch her very first chocobo. One of the most difficult parts of catching the birds is tricking their keen sense of smell, which can detect the scent of even the most cautious hunter. Q'yantaa plans to use a fragrant mushroom called chandler's wick to mask the betraying odors, and asks you to gather several to be used in the chocobo traps. Head east of Tailfeather and let your nose guide you to where the mushrooms grow.</target>
