        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ101_01750_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;As Bohemondas tells it, the knights of Ishgard plan to make his former home into a military encampment. This has upset Bohemondas greatly, made worse by the fact that his son has enlisted to help. He asks that should you see him, you present him with two choices: return to his family or forfeit them for good. Travel to Falcon's Nest and relay Bohemondas's message to his son.</target>

While the appearance of Falcon's Nest may change, he promises to protect the traditions he believes make it the home they cherish.</target>

I know how it pained him to abandon Falcon's Nest─it's &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;my&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; home, too. But he has to understand that even if our home has to change, it does not change who we are.</target>

When the day comes for him to return here, the earth beneath him may seem unfamiliar, but our companions gliding proudly through the skies will be as they always have and always will be. This, I swear.</target>
