Although there is no firewood to spare, he offers an alternate solution. A number of buildings were destroyed in a recent dragon attack, and the lumber from these buildings cannot be used again for construction. Therefore, you are welcome to use the scrap wood as fuel for the needed fires. Return to the Brume and show Brictt the bundle of scrap wood.</target>

Osaulie, the child who ran off with the scrap wood, is well known for thievery, and now her antics have jeopardized the well-being of all those seeking respite from the cold.
