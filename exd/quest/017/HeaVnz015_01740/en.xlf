As he tells it, the men and women stationed there are those found to be of little or no use elsewhere. This subtle form of demotion has left them disheartened, carrying out their duties with an empty sense of obligation. But Gildon is determined to reignite the fire in their bellies with proper nourishment. To achieve this goal, however, he must convince the quartermaster Fabrellet to make reforms to the shipment and distribution of provisions. Gildon believes Fabrellet will not listen to him, but may lend his ear to a reputable adventurer. Speak with Fabrellet, and see if he might relent on the issue.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ015_01740_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You propose the idea of improving the camp's provisions, but behind your words, Fabrellet can only hear the rumblings of Gildon's stomach. Those discontent with what they are given are free to forage for themselves, and Fabrellet believes he should do just that. To ease Gildon into taking this initiative, or at the very least quell his rumbling belly, Fabrellet asks you to procure a particular variety of mushroom known to be both nutritious and filling.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ015_01740_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You have found a cloud mushroom.
