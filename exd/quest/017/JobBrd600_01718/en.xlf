Mogta informs you that the Ballad of Oblivion is said to originate from the skies to the east, and you take this to mean the Sea of Clouds. Sanson declares that he will secure an airship to carry you there, and bids you meet him at the airship landing in Gridania. After the serpent captain takes his leave, Mogta reveals to you a secret: he has met with Guydelot, but could not convince the bard to return with him. The moogle believes that you may fare better than he did, and entrusts you with Sanson's journal in case it may be of use. Make your way to the peak of Sohm Al, where Guydelot is lingering, and show the journal to the bard.</target>

You can only stand and watch as Guydelot leaves to do his soul-searching. Follow your two other companions back to Gridania, and join them at the airship landing.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBBRD600_01718_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;You find Sanson staring longingly at a stone bearing strange markings. Mogta remembers that it is a stone of sealing, used to imprison baleful beings, but his warning comes a breath too late, and Sanson unleashes the siren that had been held within. The Ballad of Oblivion is revealed to be the fiend's soul-rending voice, which she used to annihilate the tribe of moogles that once dwelled upon Mok Oogl. Sanson is resolved to face the siren alone, and bids you and Mogta flee. At that moment, Guydelot makes his return, his words instilling Sanson with newfound courage. Together with your companions, you succeed in returning the siren to her stony prison. Though the Ballad of Oblivion never truly existed, Sanson believes that such abilities as you have mastered in the course of the mission will suffice to satisfy his superiors. Follow your friends back to the airship and let Sanson know when you are ready to return to Gridania.</target>
