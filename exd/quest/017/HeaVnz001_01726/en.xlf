Never one to pass up the opportunity to share his stories, he offers to show you around and regale you with tales of Ishgard's history. He asks you to meet him at Saint Reinette's Forum if you wish to hear more.</target>

Though the statue before you was erected in his image, it has been damaged much like other sections of Foundation. Despite the despoilment, however, the elderly Elezen is not disheartened by what has befallen Ishgard. He has no more stories to tell you, but suggests you speak with Outreguerlain at Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral should your thirst for knowledge remain unquenched.</target>

After much searching, she confronted the beast, and that would be the last time she wielded a lance.

Upon exacting her revenge, they say she cast it aside on the ground where the dragon was felled, taking up the cloth in its place.</target>
