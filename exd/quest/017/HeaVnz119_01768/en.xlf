He completed his mission but was attacked by a yeti and thrown from his chocobo. The steed saved his life by bravely drawing the beast away, but has not been seen since. The messenger returns to base to report to Luciae, but asks you to track down his beloved chocobo, Amberbeak, fearing for his safety.</target>
