				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_HEAVNZ113_01762_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;True to his word, the scout shares a useful secret about dragons. For reasons as yet unknown, the bodies of slain dragons seem to attract more powerful dragons. This has obvious tactical and strategic implications, but the scout implores you not to share this information, as it has the potential to be very, very dangerous. Tell Dominiac anyway.</target>

By repeating this process, he can attract increasingly larger dragons until he gains the glory he seeks. Hopefully he will use this knowledge wisely.</target>
