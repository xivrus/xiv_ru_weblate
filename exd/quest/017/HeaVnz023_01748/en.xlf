She warns you, however, that these creatures are very delicate. Only a perfectly preserved sample will suffice, and she doubts that she or her men could fell them while leaving their leathery appendages intact. No matter how many gaelicats it takes, she implores you to retrieve one of their wings.</target>

As it turns out, the wing sample was requested by Atelloune, a naturalist of no small renown, who is hard at work on an article for &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;New Eorzean Geographic&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. Her piece on cloudkin physiology is sure to be a smashing success due in no small part to your assistance.</target>
