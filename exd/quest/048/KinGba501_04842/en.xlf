Its powers are long forgotten, and Tsuuhe believes a magically inclined mind may prove useful in its recovery. She asks that you seek out her daughter, Tepeke, in Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han, where her search for the thief has already begun. Although the city is large, you know that information flows freely through Balshahn Bazaar, so you decide to look for Tepeke there. Be on the lookout for a young Turali woman wielding a distinct sword and shield.</target>

She tells you the essence of a tural vidraal is sealed within the treasure, and that legend states its bearer will receive great fortune, but leave only sorrow in their wake. Tepeke then shares the story of a strange newcomer to Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han who calls himself the Justiciar and claims to be the city's savior. Lacking any better leads, she suggests searching for this mysterious figure. Your starting point will be Yedlihmad, a small settlement where the Justiciar sometimes appears to rouse the public.</target>

You rush to his aid, and when he regains his senses, he relates to you the story of his encounter with the Justiciar. Clad head to toe in shining armor, the flamboyant man's idea of heroics is apparently to clear Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han of one fiendish fungus at a time. He did this by brandishing a wooden object and calling out to some unseen power, after which rocks came tumbling from the sky, knocking the Radiant unconscious and slaying the menacing mushroom. Tepeke seems certain that the wooden object is the stolen artifact, but with the Justiciar nowhere to be seen, she decides that you should both escort the Radiant back to Yedlihmad.</target>

She will continue to seek out information on the Justiciar's activities, and hopes that with two people working on the case, the Justiciar's mysteries will soon be unraveled.
