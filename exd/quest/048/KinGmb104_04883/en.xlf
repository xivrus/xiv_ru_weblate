You spar against the massive Mamool Ja, his powerful and viper-fast blows keeping you on your toes, until he is at last satisfied with your performance. Impressed by your battlecraft, the Dawnservant follows the bout with a father's earnest request to watch over his daughter. It is then that Wuk Lamat arrives. She chides Gulool Ja Ja for stealing away her champion, and exits the throne room with you in tow.</target>

The Dawnservant's plea remains at the forefront of your mind, however, as you accompany the Third Promise on the continuation of her journey.</target>
