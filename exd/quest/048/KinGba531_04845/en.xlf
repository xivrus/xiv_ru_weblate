She asks you to aid her by questioning residents in the western quarter of the city, where the impressionable youth are said to gather.</target>

He says that he was approached by the Justiciar, who purchased all the merchant's maps. Not soon after did letters appear in Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han with a copy of a map leading to the Uznair canals. Although the details are yet unclear, it is plain that Virazahn is planning something there. Return to Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han to share this discovery with Tepeke.</target>

Deciding he would be better off at home, he entrusts the map to you. You and Tepeke then enter the canals, eventually reaching a chamber full of large rocks strewn about and a group of wounded people. In the center of all this stands Virazahn. He gives a grandiose speech, declaring his intent to become known as Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han's greatest hero, before retreating behind a hail of stone, leaving the wounded behind to tell their tale. Apparently, the majority came as followers of the Justiciar, but when a duo of thieves brandished their weapons, he wielded the apex's powers against them, wounding friend and foe alike. For a blessing, none were mortally wounded, but Virazahn has once more escaped the hand of justice. After leaving the canals, Tepeke asks you to wait while she guides the people into the care of the Radiant Host.</target>
