Grenoldt, however, admits that he has more than the forge on his mind─his enduring love for Mowen can be contained no longer, and he wishes to propose to her upon their next meeting. With assistance from Quinnana, you and Chora-Zoi conceive of a strategy to aid Grenoldt in his marital quest, and make for the Exedra to set the plan in motion.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKCT301_04802_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Upon Mowen's arrival to the Exedra, Grenoldt elects to greet the object of his affections with a merry jig. To his surprise, Mowen answers his unexplained steps with a few of her own, and the two lose themselves in a moment of blissful dance. With his fond memories of the past rekindled, Grenoldt musters up the courage to ask for Mowen's hand in marriage─an offer she will happily accept once Grenoldt's travails with the splendorous tools have concluded. Grenoldt returns to the Crystalline Mean with newfound determination, while Chora-Zoi suggests you follow suit.</target>
