        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGBB241_04859_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Kupopo's trip down memory lane has yielded little success in your absence. As he reflects once more on his falling-out with Beruru, however, an answer abruptly comes to him: Beruru has &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;become&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; part of the painting. Though what Kupopo means by this is unclear, he promises to explain everything soon. First, however, you must join him on a final journey, and to that end you must meet the moogle at the Jadeite Flood.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGBB241_04859_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;At the Jadeite Flood, Kupopo tells you that Janquetilaque met his end protecting his fellow patients at the Warmwine Sanitorium, mere days before Kupopo and Beruru returned from their first adventure without him. Beruru was distraught, and in a moment of poor judgment, the moogle tried to encourage her by stating she could─and should─stand on her own two feet as a pictomancer. Beruru, however, responded with anger, leading to an argument which culminated in the two parting ways. Kupopo further explains that Beruru is an exceptionally gifted pictomancer that can imbue her creations with life─and alter the living as well. He now believes that, in a fit of grief, Beruru sealed herself within the painting─the last remnant of Janquetilaque's memory─and bids you enter the world of the painting to save her.</target>

She lives, but is trapped within a prison of her own creation, with an illusion of Janquetilaque as her gaoler. Scoffing at Kupopo's declaration that he is no more than a shade, he refuses to release her, and considers you, the inheritor of his soul crystal, to be a poor imitation incapable of defeating the master. It falls to you to strike him down and set Beruru free.</target>
