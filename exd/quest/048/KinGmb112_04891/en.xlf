Their leader proclaims his brethren the rightful overlords of Tural, and makes clear his intent to reignite their campaign of conquest with the death of the Third Promise. Before he can act on his threat, however, a monstrous bird swoops down to attack one of his men. Wuk Lamat springs into action, defending the giant from certain death, and befuddling her erstwhile antagonist with her reasons for doing so.

Leaving Alphinaud behind to tend to the injured─and the giants to puzzle over Wuk Lamat's unexpected behavior─you turn your attention back to the towering peak before you. Worqor Zormor looms impossibly high, yet if you are to reach the elector, what choice do you have but to start climbing...?

The ensuing conversation turns to the origins of the legend of the golden city, only to be interrupted by the appearance of Koana and his Archon allies. The High Luminary once more issues his challenge and, at the culmination of the battle, awards keystones to both successful claimants.

Having arrived earlier, an impatient Zoraal Ja steps forth and demands to be shown Gulool Ja Ja's living sepulchre─a monument to those who stood against the terrifying Valigarmanda. Curiosity over the names etched upon the stone is overshadowed by confusion when an unholy screech suddenly rends the air. Your sense of foreboding is confirmed when Alphinaud calls and urges you to hurry back to Worlar's Echo. Valigarmanda, the Skyruin, has broken free.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_KINGMB112_04891_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Alphinaud describes a sudden surge in aether that drew him back to the village, but by the time he returned, all hells had broken loose.
