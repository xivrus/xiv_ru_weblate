        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGBA351_04835_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Kuiyki informs you that an old friend, Cirina, has come to visit you. The hunter brings the Mol maiden before you, but even you have grown wary of impostors, and attempt to prove her identity with a simple question. She provides a satisfactory answer, then explains the reason for her visit: Samidare appeared in the Azim Steppe, once more assuming your form in an attempt to incite war between the tribes and Doma. While his initial scheme failed, you and Kuiyki suspect he may still be in the area, and Cirina encourages a visit to Reunion to gather information.</target>

It seems beyond doubt that Samidare now wears Magnai's face, and is unquestionably up to no good. Kuiyki cautions you to see to your preparations, as once you enter, the final battle will ensue.</target>

As you watch, you notice that each word Sadu utters is more unnatural than the last, and quickly discern that Samidare has taken on her form. You attempt to alert Magnai to this fact, but he is knocked out from behind before he has a chance to react. Samidare has lost patience with your frequent interventions, and takes on the late I'toca's form as you engage in battle.</target>

Seeing victory is out of the cards, he attempts to flee, but is shot down by Kuiyki, who at long last fulfills her promise to I'toca. Magnai, meanwhile, intends to make sure Samidare is punished for his crimes─and the shadow of shame he has cast over the Sun. With the Dreamweave Cocoon reclaimed at last, Kuiyki knows that the long journey home must begin─though she is uncertain how she will be greeted.</target>

Shashepya is dismayed to learn of what befell I'toca, but is relieved Kuiyki has returned safely with the cocoon in hand. Yet Kuiyki insists her accomplishments will never bring I'toca back, nor pardon her failures, and so vows to exile herself. Shashepya rejects this immediately, reassuring Kuiyki that the forest is her home. Kuiyki eventually acquiesces to Shashepya, and thanks you for all you have done. She may not be her village's greatest hunter, but she is at least a hunter now worthy of the title. With the hope that your paths may one day cross again, she sets off with Shashepya to make her long overdue return home.</target>
