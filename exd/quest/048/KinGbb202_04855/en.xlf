An abandoned manor in the Gentry's Ward has been infested with noisemaking pests, and their clamor must be silenced. Reminding you that it is the spirit of the pictomancer to lend a helping hand, Kupopo deems this matter an opportunity for you to put your skills to the proof, and volunteers you to quell the threat.</target>

His lecture is interrupted, however, by the cheerless Hearer, whose expression transforms into one of relief when you inform him of your victory. He leaves a far happier man than he was when you met him, and Kupopo is thrilled to see the culmination of your selfless efforts. Before the two of you set off for a new destination, he reminds you to continue your training and remember your promise to help find his dear friend.
