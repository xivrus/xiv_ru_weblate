While somewhat doubtful of this assertion, Astrid urges Lisette to be brave and confront her betrothed so she might get to the truth of this matter. Finding courage in the symbol of the heart─a symbol originating from her ancestor, the Countess Arabelle─Lisette storms off to show Hortefense the error of his alleged ways. Worried for her sister, Astrid asks you and Emilie to follow Lisette to the Carline Canopy.</target>

Before he can utter a word, however, the young woman reveals that she had merely sought Hortefense's advice in courtship. Surprised, yet relieved, Lisette performs the newfound gesture of ardor and affection for the maiden, telling her to follow her heart. With the misunderstanding resolved, Emilie suggests you both return to Astrid, who is undoubtedly eager to learn of how matters fared.</target>
