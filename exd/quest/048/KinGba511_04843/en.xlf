Although you know his skills to be somewhat overstated, you also know how quickly a good story can turn the hearts of the people. Tepeke does not intend to remain idle, and she suggests taking advantage of the Justiciar's newfound popularity to inquire as to his whereabouts. She wishes to start in Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han, where stories of the supposed hero's deeds are doubtless the talk of the town.</target>

Tepeke concludes that the treasure can somehow manipulate stones, but further contemplation is interrupted by the appearance of a Radiant. He informs you that a young Auri girl ran away from home to join the Justiciar, and begs for your aid in finding her. You readily agree, and the soldier suggests searching areas where the Justiciar has not been sighted. With her encyclopedic knowledge of his comings and goings, Tepeke proposes traveling to the northern shores. Go there with haste and find the young girl before aught befalls her.</target>
