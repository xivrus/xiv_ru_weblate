Out of concern for the moogle's well-being, he suggests you travel to Ul'dah and speak with an information monger who will likely know for certain what became of his friend. Cautiously optimistic, Kupopo agrees to go to Ul'dah, provided he may travel by hempen sack as before.</target>

The priest lets slip that he has more pressing concerns to address─efforts to expand the burial chambers have unearthed both an unmapped ruin and a horde of belligerent zombies. Kupopo, as is his wont, offers your services to him, and you are tasked with slaying the zombies, who are presently writhing about the Sil'dih excavation site.</target>
