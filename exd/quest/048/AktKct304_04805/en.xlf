        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKCT304_04805_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;After a moment of celebration for your splendorous tool's completion, Chora-Zoi is quick to remark on Grenoldt and Mowen's prospective wedding. Though the legendary smith initially doubts he can be a worthy spouse, Mowen reassures her betrothed, and the two are wed on the shores of the Source. Knowing their travails may keep them far apart, the couple vows their fidelity to one another with a pair of miniature kettles. Once the ceremony is concluded, you sense Grenoldt wishes one more word with you, that he might voice his appreciation for your unwavering efforts as collaborator and confidant.

Chora-Zoi, meanwhile, has gained the confidence to thrive as a smith, and bids you return to the Mean whenever the urge to forge a new splendorous tool takes you. As you reflect upon your long journey, you recall Chora-Zoi mentioning her involvement with the Mean's leaders during the project, and wonder what new insights each Facet might have to offer.</target>
