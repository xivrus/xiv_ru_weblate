She asks you to go to Tuliyollal in her stead to seek her father out, suggesting that her mother Tsuuhe can tell you his whereabouts.</target>

She informs you that her husband Nettse has indeed arrived in Tuliyollal, and spends his days trying to find information that can aid his daughter from afar. If you wish to find him, Tsuuhe tells you to go to the Pyariyoanaan Plain, where he is engaged in a search for vital clues.</target>

You exchange stories about all that has transpired since Virazahn absconded with the treasure. He shares with you a theory that the owl tural vidraal within the Perch of the Apex activates its power when it senses danger, and also relates a forgotten legend that details its fate. You should return to Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han to share this new information with Tepeke.</target>

You rush to his location just in time to catch another of his grand speeches, in which he denounces the rumors of wrongdoing and declares his intent to become king. Those present are nonplussed by his theatrics, which are then interrupted by the appearance of his father. The merchant pleads with his son to give up and turn himself over to the Radiant Host, but Virazahn unleashes the treasure's power, bringing rocks hurtling from the sky. He then leaves, declaring that he shall soon challenge you to a battle. As you watch your quarry go, Tepeke turns your attention to the aftermath, and particularly Virazahn's father.</target>

He says that it was often worn by Virazahn when he was scolded or otherwise forced to stop playing make-believe. While it is worrying that such a childish pretender has possession of the Perch of the Apex, Tepeke knows the only course of action is to return to Yedlihmad, where she can finally hear of your journey to Tural.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGBA541_04846_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;Tepeke admits that her father's theory corresponds with Virazahn's actions and thinks that perhaps the old legend hints that the tural vidraal's power increased in proportion to the danger it sensed. This explains Virazahn's eagerness to face you in battle, but Tepeke means to take advantage of his arrogance and overwhelm him with sheer magical power. She only needs to find a suitable place for an epic duel, a task for which she will recruit the Radiant Host's aid. In the meantime, prepare yourself for a battle worthy of legend.
