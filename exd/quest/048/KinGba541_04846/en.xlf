You exchange stories about all that has transpired since Virazahn absconded with the treasure. He shares with you a theory that the owl tural vidraal within the Perch of the Apex activates its power when it senses danger, and also relates a forgotten legend that details its fate.

You rush to his location just in time to catch another of his grand speeches, in which he denounces the rumors of wrongdoing and declares his intent to become king. Those present are nonplussed by his theatrics, which are then interrupted by the appearance of his father. The merchant pleads with his son to give up and turn himself over to the Radiant Host, but Virazahn unleashes the treasure's power, bringing rocks hurtling from the sky.

This explains Virazahn's eagerness to face you in battle, but Tepeke means to take advantage of his arrogance and overwhelm him with sheer magical power. She only needs to find a suitable place for an epic duel, a task for which she will recruit the Radiant Host's aid. In the meantime, prepare yourself for a battle worthy of legend.
