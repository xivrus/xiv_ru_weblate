Loazenikwe then reveals that she has already asked Firmalbert for the locations of the knights in Leophyne's former squadron, prompting Tentoawa to volunteer to speak with them.

You further learn that the Temple Knights are planning to accompany a delegation to Ok' Zundu, and Tentoawa surmises that Leophyne may target this delegation in her efforts to shame the order.

Handeloup sees merit in this approach, and moves to summon all involved to form a plan to present to the lord commander. He asks you to wait patiently while the parties are gathered.
