You assemble your companions, but barely manage to take a step in the direction of the many-colored mountain when Vorporlor appears and forbids you from trespassing on their sacred site.

The standoff only intensifies when Wuk Lamat's brothers arrive to offer their assistance, and it takes an earnest reminder from one of Vorporlor's own underlings to persuade the giant to allow the hunting party to pass. Your numbers now bolstered by the First and Second Promise, you set forth to slay the thousand-year-old menace spoken of in fear and immortalized in stone─Valigarmanda, the Skyruin!
