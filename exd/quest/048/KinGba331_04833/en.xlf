Relating the difficulties she experienced when first arriving in Kugane, she thanks you for sticking by her. The heartfelt moment is interrupted by the arrival of Samidare's childhood friend, whom you met at the House of the Fierce. In an urgent rush he informs you that Samidare is hiding on Hells' Lid, and bids you investigate the area alone so you may bring your all to bear.</target>

In the split second you look away, she prepares to stab you, when the real Kuiyki rushes in and tackles her doppleganger, revealing an exasperated Samidare. Fed up that his plan was thwarted once again, he promises to prepare a more thorough method of murder for your next meeting before taking flight as a bird. Kuiyki curses herself for being so gullible, and with horror, realizes that Samidare most likely used her form when he murdered I'toca. Wary there may still be dangers lying in wait, she suggests you both return to Kugane.</target>
