As the hero who saved Palaka's Stand during the Final Days, you will no doubt have ample opportunity to ask questions of the villagers. Mehdjina adds that there are “others” with whom she wishes to speak as well, and as understanding passes between them, you glimpse a raw pain in Hasdahd's eyes.

Having fulfilled this personal obligation, Mehdjina and Hasdahd are now ready to address the village's situation, and your words of guidance are all they need to piece together an idea to secure the future prosperity of both Palaka's Stand &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;and&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; Tataru Taru's Boutique.</target>

The finished piece is even more stunning than anyone anticipated─and for the final touch, Varsarudh insists that you engrave the symbol of Nald'thal into the backing of the sapphire. After you oblige her to the best of your ability, the four of you scurry off to Scholar's Harbor to await Tataru's imminent return.

After briefing Tataru on events in Palaka's Stand, Mehdjina pitches her idea for Hannish handicrafts, which the entrepreneur takes to straightaway. The subsequent confirmation that her employees intend to remain with the boutique for the foreseeable future gives Tataru cause to relax. However, the air still tingles with anticipation...

Tataru jovially accepts the surprise gift handed to her─and then, as her gaze falls upon the tear-shaped sapphire, her eyes grow wide in recognition. As she listens to the tale of the necklace's restoration, the weight of what she now holds becomes clear: a fragment of what she thought lost framed by all she has gained. A celebration of the connections she has forged with people throughout the world, and the beauty they have brought into countless lives.</target>
