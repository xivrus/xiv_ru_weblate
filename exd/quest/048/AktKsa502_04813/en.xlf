Tataru jovially accepts the surprise gift handed to her─and then, as her gaze falls upon the tear-shaped sapphire, her eyes grow wide in recognition. As she listens to the tale of the necklace's restoration, the weight of what she now holds becomes clear: a fragment of what she thought lost framed by all she has gained.
