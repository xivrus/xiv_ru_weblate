        <target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY902_04811_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The royal seneschal appears to be Peatie's biggest fan, and he invites both her and Aldemund to Ul'dah, that the goobbue might be the star attraction of this year's Little Ladies' Day. Requesting your assistance in comforting Peatie as she becomes accustomed to the crowds, he departs to Ul'dah to make preparations for her grand debut. Aldemund and Peatie have business to attend to in Gridania before they follow, so the performer asks you to go ahead and await their arrival.
