Their pursuit of the thief has led them to Tuliyollal, where he is believed to have boarded a ship and escaped to Eorzea. Fearing that the elderly Raholl Ja would not survive such a perilous voyage, Ceetol Ja has given chase alone, her only clue being an empty bottle of Ala Mhigan make left by the culprit. Raholl Ja asks that you search for his granddaughter, that you may lend her your knowledge and expertise. As her current location is unknown, you head to Rhalgr's Reach to gather information.</target>

The tall, slender thief she seeks apparently bears a passing resemblance to a bandit leader known to ply his trade in Virdjala. In all likelihood, your would-be ally has journeyed into the desert alone, heedless of the potential danger.</target>

Though he has only minor injuries, his wares were stolen, and his escort left in pursuit of the criminals. You follow the escort and witness the bandit leader using the power of the Steelhog Vessel to render himself invulnerable, with the bodyguard's attacks leaving not so much as a scratch before he is sent sprawling by a magical blast. Somewhat uncharacteristically for a supposed master thief, the bearer of the artifact makes no bones about revealing his name─Chalteaufite─before he and his accomplices make their escape, uncontested. Ceetol Ja decides to escort the merchant and his escort to Rhalgr's Reach for medical attention, and asks you to meet her there to help report the incident to the Resistance.</target>
