He explains that their leader Chalteaufite is a member of a larger organization known as the Passage of the Unbound, which has been wreaking havoc throughout Eorzea. Among their preferred targets are the trade caravans that travel between Gridania and Ala Mhigo, with one such incident having recently occurred near Porta Praetoria. The troops stationed there should be able to provide further details.</target>
