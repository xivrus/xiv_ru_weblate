        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGBB211_04856_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Kupopo can tell from your very aura that you have grown more adept at pictomancy─a talent he credits to having once journeyed with two prominent pictomancers: Janquetilaque and his young disciple, Beruru. Though Janquetilaque has since passed away, Kupopo desperately seeks Beruru, who may be traveling the realm alone. With little information to be found in Gridania, Kupopo suggests you follow the road he once traveled with his dear friends and proceed to Camp Dragonhead.</target>

Bereft of cheer once more, he informs you that his Ishgardian counterpart is in poor health due to an injury he has suffered. A particular antidote may facilitate his recovery, but it requires the horn of a rare hartebeest to prepare. Hearing this, Kupopo proposes that you procure it for the Hearer, and so you are advised to speak with the knights of Camp Dragonhead in the hopes that one may have seen the skittish creature recently.</target>

You take a moment to reflect on your previous adventures to Ishgard, inspiring Kupopo to set his sights anew once he finishes making inquiries in the camp.
