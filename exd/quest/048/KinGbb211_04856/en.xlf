Though Janquetilaque has since passed away, Kupopo desperately seeks Beruru, who may be traveling the realm alone. With little information to be found in Gridania, Kupopo suggests you follow the road he once traveled with his dear friends and proceed to Camp Dragonhead.</target>

A particular antidote may facilitate his recovery, but it requires the horn of a rare hartebeest to prepare. Hearing this, Kupopo proposes that you procure it for the Hearer, and so you are advised to speak with the knights of Camp Dragonhead in the hopes that one may have seen the skittish creature recently.</target>
