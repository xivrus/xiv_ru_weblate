No sooner has he thanked you for your kind support than you receive a linkpearl call from Erenville.

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_KINGMA120_04879_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Much to Wuk Lamat's dismay, it transpires that Erenville has requisitioned a large, barge-like boat which is to be pulled by a placid marine creature known as a punutiy. Koana then makes an unexpected appearance, along with his heretofore hidden collaborators─Thancred and Urianger. Your fellow Scions are seemingly delighted by the prospect of competing against their Archon comrades; however, now is not the occasion for such a competition, as the Second Promise will not be traveling on the river. Koana and his entourage soon depart, leaving you to prepare for the potential dangers of a journey along Ihuykatumu.

Aggravated by your prowess, the two-head then turns his attention to your punutiy, wounding the creature and damaging the front of your vessel. Erenville is thus forced to ground the boat while you scout on ahead.

A perilous detour through an abandoned Yok Huy mine sees you encounter Koana and his entourage─yet while the meeting does not come to blows, they delay your progress nonetheless. Eventually, you emerge near the river, where you are rejoined by Erenville, Alisaie, and the recovered punutiy.

Your group sets off again and presently arrives at Dock Tumu. Encouraged to let her guard down by you and your companions, it seems Wuk Lamat has much to think about as you make for the nearby mountain camp...</target>
