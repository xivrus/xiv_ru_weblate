Apparently one of the guild's customers is refusing to pay for his tailor-made ensemble, though the reason for this is not entirely clear. At the weaver's request, you go to investigate the matter and search for a man carrying a pair of swords on his back who refers to himself as a “viper.”</target>

Having traveled to Eorzea from a continent beyond the ocean to the west, Keshkwa is unfamiliar with local customs and did not anticipate that he would have to pay for the clothing he had commissioned. Although the weaver had not initially agreed to such an arrangement, he takes pity on the traveler and proposes that he dispatch a particularly troublesome beast that has been terrorizing traders near Camp Drybone. Naturally, Keshkwa is glad for the opportunity, but the weaver asks that you accompany him to ensure the work is performed as requested.</target>

He quickly locates the gargantuan scalekin and effortlessly dispatches it with his twinned blades. Noting your undisguised amazement at this impressive display of swordsmanship, Keshkwa asks whether you would be interested in becoming a viper yourself. However, he extends the offer under the sole condition that you help him slay a dangerous creature known as a tural vidraal that has made its way to Eorzea from Tural. As he does not expect an immediate answer, the two of you return to the Weavers' Guild to report Keshkwa's successful felling of the fiend.</target>
