It seems Loazenikwe traveled to Ishgard out of concern for Tentoawa's well-being. After you reveal his condition, she suggests gathering ingredients for a mixture which her people have used to rouse previous Shut Eyes from inescapable slumbers. She requires dandelions from the Churning Mists and saliva from morbols in the Dravanian hinterlands, and asks that you gather the former ingredient first.</target>

Before that becomes a reality, however, Leophyne must be stopped. Tentoawa admits that he feels much weaker, and you suggest that perhaps the artifact transfers the aether of its target to its wielder, rather than the wielder transferring their fatigue. This has dire implications should Leophyne chose to use the artifact without restraint, and so Tentoawa pledges to train himself back into fighting shape before she acts again. Until then, he encourages you to do the same.

※The next role quest will be available from Tentoawa upon reaching level 98 in any tank class.</target>
