The Resistance commander has decided to let one of the culprits go free, and tasks you with following him in the hope he will skulk back to the gang's den. Given the covert nature of the mission and the inherent danger posed by an unknown number of thieves, she judges you to be the ideal candidate for the mission. As one might expect, Ceetol Ja insists on joining you, and you set forth for Ala Ghiri, where the prisoner is due to be released.</target>

Your espionage is brought to an abrupt end when Kaqool Ja confronts you, and the mercenary keeps you occupied while Chalteaufite and the others escape. He warns you and Ceetol Ja against involving yourselves any further in their affairs before departing.
