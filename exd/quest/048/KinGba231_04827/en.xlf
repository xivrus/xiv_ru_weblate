Ellerete and Kokonowa have contaminated the waters of the Warmwine Sanitorium with illusory toxins, leaving no few victims in their wake. Before they make good their escape, Ellerete─suffering from the effects of her own poison─proclaims she has bigger plans for all of Vylbrand...but you and Loashkana must focus first on the victims of her mischief.</target>

You suspect this may be due to Kokonowa's Dunesfolk heritage, and Loashkana is intrigued to learn the Lalafellin clan's tradition of regularly ingesting small amounts of poison to build immunity.
