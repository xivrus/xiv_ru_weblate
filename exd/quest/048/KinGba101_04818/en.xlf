Housing the soul of a narwhal which became a tural vidraal, this object can transfer the wielder's fatigue to another, granting the former unflagging vitality and lulling the latter into an irresistible slumber. A man named Tentoawa, mightiest warrior of their village, has crossed the sea to recover the sacred item, and Loazenikwe asks you to follow him to Ishgard and protect him during his search. You agree to journey to that snowbound city, and Loazenikwe suggests asking around its taverns for a young man with blue hair.</target>

While reticent at first, Gibrillont eventually admits that a young man from a far-off land was asking around about a stolen object. While the tavern's patrons couldn't point him in the right direction, Gibrillont informs you that he sent the youth to the Jeweled Crozier, and suggests going there if you wish to find him.</target>

He describes the thief as an Elezen with a distinct scar, whose deadly grace belied a martial prowess unbefitting of the scholarly robes she disguised herself in. After hearing this you conclude that she might be known among the knights of the Congregation, and Tentoawa wastes no time in deciding that the barracks will be your next destination.</target>
