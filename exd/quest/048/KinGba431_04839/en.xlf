Avenel and Pepin, the pair masquerading as merchants, soon reveal the true nature of their relationship with Chalteaufite. He won over several poor citizens of Ul'dah by demonstrating the power of the Steelhog Vessel and making promises of change. After it became clear that his aims amounted to little more than raiding merchant caravans, the other members quickly became disillusioned, though their attempts at protest were met with threats and violence from their mystically empowered leader. Pepin also confirms that the mercenary Kaqool Ja is indeed a stranger to these lands, having crossed an ocean to reach Eorzea.
