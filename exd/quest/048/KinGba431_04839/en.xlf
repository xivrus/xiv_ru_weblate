        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGBA431_04839_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Upon arriving in Ala Gannha, you waste no time in locating your targets. Avenel and Pepin, the pair masquerading as merchants, soon reveal the true nature of their relationship with Chalteaufite. He won over several poor citizens of Ul'dah by demonstrating the power of the Steelhog Vessel and making promises of change. After it became clear that his aims amounted to little more than raiding merchant caravans, the other members quickly became disillusioned, though their attempts at protest were met with threats and violence from their mystically empowered leader. Pepin also confirms that the mercenary Kaqool Ja is indeed a stranger to these lands, having crossed an ocean to reach Eorzea. Contrite for their past deeds, the two merchants offer to help convince others to leave the gang and retrieve the artifact, a proposal which Ceetol Ja readily accepts.</target>

As a show of goodwill, she plans to present to him a gift; a traditional incense burner complete with incense of the same aroma commonly used by her people, which will hopefully remind Kaqool Ja of his homeland and thereby make him more receptive to conversation. In order to create this incense, you will need to collect some copal tree resin, which as luck would have it, can be found nearby.</target>

The mercenary reveals that his primary reason for assisting Chalteaufite is to earn enough money for the ferry crossing back to Tural, which his employer has told him costs an exorbitant amount. When Ceetol Ja informs him that this is far from true, he comes to the realization that he has been deceived into aiding a heartless criminal, and resolves to confront Chalteaufite alone. With one more of Chalteaufite's gang turned, Ceetol Ja bids you return to the safety of Ala Ghiri.</target>
