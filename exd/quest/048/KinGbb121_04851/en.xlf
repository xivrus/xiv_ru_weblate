Once the pouches are ready, you will be able to drive Iq Soq Xmajun to a location of your choosing. Innocent Stork then asks if, rather than killing Iq Soq Xmajun, it would be possible to capture it instead so that it might be studied. Keshkwa, however, is far from keen on the idea, reminding her of her hunters' failure to outwit the clever beast. Even if it were captured, he is certain that it would escape and declares that it must be slain without hesitation. Innocent Stork concedes and accepts his argument, but Keshkwa suspects she is hiding something─as is Golias, whom the viper observes to be acting strangely. Hunting Iq Soq Xmajun is challenging enough, but having to do so while questioning the motives of your allies only complicates the matter...

※The next viper quest will be available from Keshkwa upon reaching level 88.</target>
