        <target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY901_04810_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;As dependably as eggs fall from a laying hen, this year's Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide festivities are being overseen by none other than Jihli Aliapoh, whose ambitions extend further than ever before. She describes to you her dream of a goobbue upon a stage in Ul'dah, and details her plan to hold a tandem celebration of both Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide and Little Ladies' Day which will spread joy across two of Eorzea's city-states. However, she must first convince the planners of Little Ladies' Day that the goobbue performer she hired poses no danger to the people. The royal seneschal has traveled from Ul'dah on behalf of his peers, and Jihli has instructed you both to visit Bentbranch Meadows, where the goobbue is even now delivering joy to all and sundry.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

She must first win the hearts of the people of Gridania, however, and for that Aldemund requires your aid. It seems Peatie suffers from a minor case of stage fright, and Aldemund would have you ride on the goobbue's head to reassure her as she delivers smiles to the people.</target>
