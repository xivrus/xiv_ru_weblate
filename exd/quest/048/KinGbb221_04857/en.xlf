While the knight is eager to express his gratitude, he regrets to inform you that neither he nor his comrades stationed along the border have seen anyone matching Beruru's description. As the two take their leave, Kupopo declares Kugane to be your next destination. Since you have been there before and presumably attuned to the local aetheryte, he invites you to stuff him in a hempen sack so that you may teleport there with him in tow.</target>

Your reminiscence is interrupted by a distraught art trader, whose crate of goods was tossed overboard during his voyage from Ul'dah. Assuming it did not sink into the depths, the tides have likely carried the crate into the Ruby Sea, and given your cordial relationship with the Confederacy, you are the trader's best hope of recovering it. Consulting with the pirates of Sakazuki would be a reasonable first step.</target>
