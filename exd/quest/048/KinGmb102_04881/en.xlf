The first of these is the artisan's piping hot meals, which the average Hhetsarro would not appreciate and which Wuk Lamat will discuss with the Moblin's cook. The second is the state of Kaahe's tools─an oversight which Rakorok is only too happy to correct. The third concerns the sweltering heat inside the Workpot, which you are tasked to alleviate by salvaging a “draftyshard” from nearby boat wrecks. According to Rakorok, you should be able to spot the tunnel to the shoals in question from just outside the village.</target>
