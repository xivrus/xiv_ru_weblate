        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGBA301_04830_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Shashepya, a woman from a secluded village in the forests of Xak Tural, has been searching for one who can aid in the retrieval of her home's stolen treasure, the Dreamweave Cocoon. Those who possess it possess the power to mimic not only the form, but abilities of anyone they have seen. According to an eyewitness, the thief was headed towards Kugane, which is where the foremost hunter of her village, I'toca, has followed in pursuit. Yet with no word of I'toca's progress in days, Shashepya is worried the hunter may require the aid of one more familiar with the land, and suggests you may find her by inquiring at the local tavern.</target>
