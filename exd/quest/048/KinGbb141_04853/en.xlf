Even more surprising is a message for you and Keshkwa, which seems to be a coded plea for help, suggesting that Iq Soq Xmajun is currently somewhere in southern Thanalan. The officer observes that the true message cannot have escaped Innocent Stork's notice, and that the fact she allowed it to be sent means you are almost certainly walking into a trap. Keshkwa is undeterred, however, welcoming any opportunity to confront and kill the vidraal.

Lying at her feet is a motionless Golias, who appears to be the beast's latest victim. A heated battle with Iq Soq Xmajun ensues, during which Keshkwa deduces its subdued behavior to be related to a pouch of wildgrass the entrepreneur is carrying to keep Iq Soq Xmajun in check─though the viper remains convinced their alliance will not last. Sure enough, when Golias's sudden recovery draws Innocent Stork's attention and forces her to turn her back to Iq Soq Xmajun, it seizes the opportunity to rid itself of its supposed master.

Keshkwa then asks for his help finding clients in need of a hunter, as your mentor will need to earn sufficient money to pay for passage back to Tural. For the time being at least, Golias will be able to pursue his dream of protecting innocent people from rampaging beasts, while Keshkwa will remain in Eorzea a little longer.
