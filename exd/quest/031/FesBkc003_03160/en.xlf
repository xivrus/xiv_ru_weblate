Brief though it was, the fishing session helps to lift his spirits, and he finds his determination anew. You then turn your steps back to Gridania to rejoin Kipih, but not before taking something called a “photo” together as a memento.</target>

Apparently, magitek troopers have also appeared in Ixali territory, their presence alarming the beastmen and spurring them to summon forth their goddess, Garuda. Upon hearing the name, Noctis reveals that he vanquished a being by the same name back in his world, and is confident that the feat can be repeated here. While Kipih sets out to secure a loan of Cid's airship to bear you to the Howling Eye, Noctis bestows upon you his power─the ability to warp. Once your preparations are in order, you may proceed to the Carline Canopy, where Kipih will be waiting.</target>
