You opt to go directly to the meeting place at the Bokairo Inn, as J'olhmyn and M'zhet are likely to find their way back to the port city before you.</target>

It seems that Nhaza'a has already brought Alpa and Gyorei out on deck, presumably to be presented as the Three Wonders to his buyer─namely, the unscrupulous merchant Kageyama. The moment for action has come. Nhaza'a and Kageyama must be stopped before Alpa and Gyorei are relieved of flesh and fin.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANALL240_03164_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You and your companions rush aboard the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Kuroboro Maru&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, arriving just in time for J'olhmyn to save Alpa from a grisly fate at the hands of Nhaza'a Jaab. Though an ungallant kick to the ribs sends J'olhmyn sprawling, the rest of your group rushes forward to continue the fight. This includes Gyoshin, who appears not a moment too soon, perched on an airborne mikoshi. Without preamble, he rams it into Kageyama, sending the villain─along with many a Namazu mikoshi bearer─flying. Meanwhile, Kabuto takes advantage of the confusion to slash at a distracted Nhaza'a, leaving him clutching a wound in his abdomen. Though the villain is still unwilling to surrender, the sound of the Sekiseigumi's whistle sends him loping to his skiff, hidden nearby as a means of escape. Though M'zhet's lobbed grenade fails to detonate, it is nevertheless successful in driving Nhaza'a off his boat and into the water, where he is dragged under by an unidentified finned creature. Kageyama's flight is more successful─he's halfway to Kogane Dori by the time you notice his departure. You, of course, give chase, Alpa and Kabuto in tow.</target>

As you close in, he realizes that you are in pursuit, and hastily scatters a great deal of coin, causing nearby citizens to block your path as they scramble to lay hands on it. It immediately becomes clear, however, that he failed to account for the presence of a skilled Ananta goldsmith, as Alpa removes the distraction by shaping the money into a large ornament of the sort found atop Namazu mikoshi─dispersing the crowd as they realize with horror that their financial windfall is now an ichthyic monument of questionable monetary or artistic value. Though the thwarted Kageyama once again attempts to flee on foot, he runs right into Hancock and a pair of Sekiseigumi, and is summarily detained. Perhaps he will at last face justice for eschewing morality in the name of greed. Perhaps.</target>
