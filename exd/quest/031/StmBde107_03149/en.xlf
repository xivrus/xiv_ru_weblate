The Archon duly relates his own experience of the voice, adding that he heard it at what was all but certainly the selfsame moment. Unwilling to speculate idly on who might be responsible, he declares his intention to make for Ala Mhigo to examine Thancred in person. Before you all depart, however, Y'shtola takes the opportunity to raise the subject of a strange phenomenon she observed in the Far East─which Urianger rather smugly deduces to be the localized aetheric thinning simultaneously observed across Eorzea. Mindful that it cannot be a coincidence, the two Archons are in the midst of agreeing to investigate the matter further when the voice returns to assault your minds again. Your skull ringing, you open your eyes to see Urianger and Y'shtola collapsed upon the ground, and a desperate Alisaie trying in vain to rouse them as all around rush to your aid.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDE107_03149_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Though plainly distraught at the plight of your comrades, Alisaie attempts to take charge of the situation, ordering that Thancred be brought to the Rising Stones for observation alongside the others.
