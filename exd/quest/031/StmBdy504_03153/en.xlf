        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDY504_03153_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Having made considerable progress with the reconstruction of the enclave, Kozakura is weighing up the possibility of reintroducing a ritual known as “tento-okuri,” in which floating paper lanterns are released into the air, drifting on the wind to guide spirits of deceased kin to the afterlife. Though the custom has not been observed since the Garlean occupation, Tsuranuki and Araragi are old enough to remember it and reveal not only further details surrounding the tradition, but a willingness to hold such an event at the One Garden. Without a moment's hesitation, they throw themselves into the preparations, persuading you and Kozakura to spread word among the locals.</target>
