Apparently, an unusual black vehicle has been sighted in Thanalan along with peculiar mechanical soldiers, and there is growing concern that they may be some unknown type of Garlean weaponry. Kipih petitions your assistance to pen her story, and in case you should be amenable, she directs you to the vicinity of Black Brush, where the black vehicle was most recently sighted.

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESBKC001_03158_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;At Black Brush, you come upon the black vehicle and its owner, a young man by the name of Noctis, who appears to be very far from home. His vehicle, the Regalia, has broken down, and he is relieved to learn that you know people who might be able to repair it. Soon after, you are joined by a crew from Garlond Ironworks and Cid himself, who promises to do his best with the Regalia. It then transpires that not only is Noctis acquainted with the mechanical soldiers, which he calls magitek troopers, but that both he and his automated adversaries hail from a world entirely different from your own. At Cid's suggestion, Noctis goes off to search for the magitek troopers in hopes of finding a way to return home. Follow Noctis and help him to defeat the magitek troopers by participating in the FATE “Like Clockwork” at the Clutch in central Thanalan.</target>
