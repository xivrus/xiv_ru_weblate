Soon after, you are joined by a crew from Garlond Ironworks and Cid himself, who promises to do his best with the Regalia. It then transpires that not only is Noctis acquainted with the mechanical soldiers, which he calls magitek troopers, but that both he and his automated adversaries hail from a world entirely different from your own. At Cid's suggestion, Noctis goes off to search for the magitek troopers in hopes of finding a way to return home.
