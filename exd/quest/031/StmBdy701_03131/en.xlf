Once inside, he discovered the tower was crawling with hellish beasts and was lucky to escape with his life. Rasho adds that he is keen to investigate the denizens of the tower before they find a way outside. However, the tower is considered sacred ground by the people of the Ruby Sea, and any attempts to enter it would be seen as an affront. The Confederacy can ill afford any further damage to their already questionable reputation, so Rasho asks that you, as an outsider, infiltrate the tower in secret.</target>
