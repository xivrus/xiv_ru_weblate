        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Acot, the salt merchant, is something of a fan of you and yours. He thanks you profusely for your part in facilitating the joint enterprise of the sultana and Lord Lolorito that saw the Saltery restored, for the revitalized industry has led directly to the creation of countless new jobs for Ala Mhigan refugees in Ul'dah. The influx of new wealth has transformed the community and brought prosperity to people outside and inside the walls─and Pearl Lane is no exception.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Landebert is unsurprisingly unwilling to take this new era of prosperity at face value, for he knows all too well how easily the wealthy elite of Ul'dah can bend the truth. This is why without hesitation he rejected an offer of employment from one of the most prestigious banks in the sultanate. However, to your mutual surprise, Lord Lolorito of the East Aldenard Trading Company decides to make a personal appearance to persuade the refugee leader to work for the financial institution, explaining that people look to him for guidance, and would be more willing to place their faith in the many ventures associated with the Mirage Trust if they saw him do so as well. Seeing an opportunity to aid his countrymen, Landebert agrees to work for the bank, provided that he and his countrymen are afforded various benefits in formal written contracts, and that they are afforded representation to negotiate for additional considerations in the future. After a moment's deliberation, Lolorito agrees─likely believing that any such Ala Mhigan union could be easily subverted if necessary. And perhaps it can and will be...but not without considerable resistance from Landebert and his like-minded comrades.</target>
