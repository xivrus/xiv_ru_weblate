This is why without hesitation he rejected an offer of employment from one of the most prestigious banks in the sultanate. However, to your mutual surprise, Lord Lolorito of the East Aldenard Trading Company decides to make a personal appearance to persuade the refugee leader to work for the financial institution, explaining that people look to him for guidance, and would be more willing to place their faith in the many ventures associated with the Mirage Trust if they saw him do so as well. Seeing an opportunity to aid his countrymen, Landebert agrees to work for the bank, provided that he and his countrymen are afforded various benefits in formal written contracts, and that they are afforded representation to negotiate for additional considerations in the future. After a moment's deliberation, Lolorito agrees─likely believing that any such Ala Mhigan union could be easily subverted if necessary. And perhaps it can and will be...but not without considerable resistance from Landebert and his like-minded comrades.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Acot in central Thanalan.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Speak with the refugees of Pearl Lane.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Landebert.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ981_03186_BLOEZOENG_000_000&lt;tab&gt;A moment of your time, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;?
