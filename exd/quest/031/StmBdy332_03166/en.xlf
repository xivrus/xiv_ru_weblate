Alas, relief soon gives way to despair as the restored wards shatter, and the mad auspice emerges from the sacred crystal, the picture of rage personified. In a flash, he dispatches Genbu, and with him the last vestiges of hope. Your fates all but sealed, you join with the surviving auspices in a valiant yet futile last stand...only to find yourselves in the company of the long-dead Tenzen. Yet even bolstered by the spirit's considerable strength, you are unable to beat back Koryu, until Soroban, in a noble act of sacrifice, summons the soul of the departed Genbu into his body that the resurrected auspice might turn the tide, and together with you and his comrades imprison Koryu for millennia to come.</target>

It would seem that the Kojin's soul is possessed of immense spiritual strength, owing to his recent trials and tribulations. Accordingly, when he summoned Genbu's soul into his body, his own managed to endure; as a result, however, the auspice's resurrection is fleeting, and in time he will pass from this world as before. With his remaining time, he intends to train Soroban to succeed him as the next Genbu and take his place alongside his comrades as one of the Four Lords. Though he is by no means confident in his ability to rise to the occasion, the Kojin understands and appreciates the need for guardians to watch over the Ruby Sea, and is willing to do his best to live up to their expectations.</target>

Nevertheless, it fills him with pride to think that a Kojin of the Blue has been granted such a tremendous honor. Still, he cannot help but worry that Soroban might grow lonely in the days ahead, and so he asks that you make an effort to go and see him from time to time. And why would you not? For there are few places in the world one may enjoy the company of adorable and surly talking beasts!</target>
