        <target state="final">TEXT_BANNAM004_03100_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Gyoshin is on the point of relaying another dire warning imparted by his ancestor when Seigetsu the Enlightened, having detected a familiar pattern, interjects to hasten matters along. He recommends that Gyoshin look into the Xaela's traditions, which may have been influenced by those of the Namazu long ago, for clues as to what vital element might be missing from the festival. Gyoshin, however, refuses to go without your protection, lest the Xaela get any ideas about their evening meal.
