He recommends that Gyoshin look into the Xaela's traditions, which may have been influenced by those of the Namazu long ago, for clues as to what vital element might be missing from the festival. Gyoshin, however, refuses to go without your protection, lest the Xaela get any ideas about their evening meal.
