        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBAOZ501_03199_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Latool Ja is the first to congratulate you on your spectacular victory over Azulmagia. The self-confessed villain of the piece, Whastrach, arrives to commend your performance, and promises to relinquish his hold on Lapis Canyon, as per the agreement. Much to everyone's surprise, he even asks Ceadda if he will act as his guide in the New World, in order to secure another source of ceruleum without adversely affecting the lives of the inhabitants. The young Whalaqee senses the sincerity in Whastrach's words, and accepts the offer in the hope that his advice will prevent any more unpleasant confrontations. As the two of them leave to prepare for their journey across the Indigo Deep, Royse reminds you that your services as Azuro the Second are still very much in demand, and that she is expecting you to make further appearances in the Masked Carnivale. Martyn, too, in spite of his initial reluctance, plans to continue in the role of the Great Azuro until a better─or more profitable─idea springs to mind.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBAOZ501_03199_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;After an extremely brief period of contemplation, Martyn decides that his new goal in life is to found a Blue Mages' Guild. In order to do so, he will first need to gather the necessary capital, and what better way to do that than continuing to appear in the lucrative─and highly dangerous─Masked Carnivale? Martyn reminds you that there is room in the spotlight for both Azuros, and that the door to the Celestium is always open to you.

※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn once you have completed the main scenario quest “Litany of Peace.”</target>
