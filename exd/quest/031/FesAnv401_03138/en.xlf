The Immortal Flames will soon be hosting “The Calamity Retold,” military exercises which draw from the lessons of the imperial invasion that took place years past. The Lalafell plans to interview people about their experiences of that time, and bids you accompany him that you might offer your unique perspective on the matter. The first stop is the Hall of Flames, where you will meet with an officer of the order.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESANV401_03138_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;According to the flame commander, the military exercises are intended to cultivate awareness of the Garlean threat within citizens, many of whom have forgotten how close Ul'dah came to becoming a battlefield during the Calamity. Then, it was only by the valor of audacious adventurers that the city was spared, and the commander hopes that the Immortal Flames may continue to rely upon you and yours. The first interview thus concluded, Dural Tharal bids you join him at the Pugilists' Guild for the next.</target>

And while the tactic succeeded in weakening the wills of some, in others it served only to strengthen the spirit of resistance─a spirit that still lives on today. Satisfied with the fruits of this interview, Dural Tharal sets off for the Thaumaturges' Guild, there to meet with another who lived through the horrors of the Calamity.</target>

As the red moon Dalamud drew closer, its dark influence unleashed hordes of voidsent upon the land. But as they did the imperial invaders, adventurers again rose to contend with this threat and protect the people. The thaumaturge takes her leave, but not before expressing her gratitude and respect for all of adventurerkind. The next interview is the last, and Dural Tharal turns his steps towards the Gate of the Sultana, where he will speak with a long-serving Brass Blade.</target>

The man then returns to his post, but not before joining his voice to the chorus of gratitude for adventurers.

As the song resounds in your mind, you are whisked away to a place beyond the reach of time and space. Before you stands a strange yet familiar figure─a man named Naoki Yoshida, who offers you profuse thanks for your tireless efforts in making the world a better place. Scarcely do you begin to gather your thoughts, however, than your visit to this realm comes to an end, and you find yourself on the Ruby Road Exchange once more, batting your eyelids to the sound of Dural Tharal's vigorous clapping. After the reporter leaves, the minstrel favors you with another song, one whose cryptic words confound even as they seem to speak to you. Thankfully, the minstrel's parting message is less cryptic: even as we keep our gaze upon the future, let us never forget those we have lost. For it is their memory that gives us the strength to carry on.</target>
