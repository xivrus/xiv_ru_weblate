As the Great Azuro, he has already gained something of a following, and a small group of fans interrupts your conversation to have him perform his─apparently─customary pre-fight speech. While he seems to be relishing his newfound stardom rather more than anyone had anticipated, he finds time in his busy schedule to impart to you his knowledge, and arranges to meet you in Spineless Basin in central Thanalan.</target>

He suggests that you test your recently acquired Blood Drain spell on these vilekin, so that you may gain valuable experience in using blue magic against a genuine threat.</target>

It is slowly becoming apparent that blue magic may yet serve as a viable means of dispatching a variety of threats, and that Martyn's claims of its endless potential may be founded in fact after all.</target>

In an attempt to prove that he has not entirely forgotten about mentoring you in blue magic, he sets you the task of learning another spell, namely, Mind Blast.

※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn upon reaching level 20 and learning Mind Blast.</target>
