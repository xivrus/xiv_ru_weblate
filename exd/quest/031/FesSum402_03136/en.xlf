        <target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM402_03136_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Beaudefoin explains the simple rules of the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course. Each of the three sections is marshaled by a Moonfire Faire chaperone, to whom you must speak before proceeding any further. J'nangho is the first chaperone and can only be reached by a series of carefully measured leaps.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Each jump and balancing act is more perilous than the last, and you breathe a sigh of relief when you finally reach Hildelana. While she is clearly delighted that you have made it this far, she is nonetheless quick to impress on you that the worst is still to come...</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM402_03136_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Faced with the imposing final section of the course, you step forward with trepidation. Knowing that every leap could end in dismal failure, you feel as though your heart is in your throat as you slowly ascend the tower. At long last, the goal is in sight, and with one final jump, your triumph is secured. P'obyano the chaperone welcomes you with a beaming smile, and elated cheers can be heard from the spectators watching from Costa del Sol. There can be no doubt in the minds of the awed onlookers that the Adventurers' Guild boasts the most courageous, nimblest warriors Eorzea has ever seen.</target>
