        <target state="final">TEXT_FESHLW501_03169_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Adventurers' Guild investigator speaks to you of unsettling rumors regarding the Continental Circus's All Saints' Wake masquerade. He's heard tell of revelers going missing from the manor in which the gala is held, and given the Impresario's history of mischief─and more─thinks it prudent to further investigate these claims. For reasons related to the investigator's own lack of subtlety, it falls to you to speak with the Impresario and attempt to divine whether his intentions are malicious.

He also appears to be concerned that someone is watching him─though not concerned enough to cease uttering his thoughts aloud, it seems. When he at last stops talking, you hear another voice, no more than a whisper, from somewhere behind you.</target>

The sort-of ghosts reveal that they are privy to the Impresario's plan─to turn party guests into pumpkins, thereby generating sufficient terror to bring about the Night of Devilry─and have also witnessed a young girl being kidnapped from the masquerade by a member of the troupe for this purpose.</target>
