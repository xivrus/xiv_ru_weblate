He's heard tell of revelers going missing from the manor in which the gala is held, and given the Impresario's history of mischief─and more─thinks it prudent to further investigate these claims. For reasons related to the investigator's own lack of subtlety, it falls to you to speak with the Impresario and attempt to divine whether his intentions are malicious.
