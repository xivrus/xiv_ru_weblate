Joy and dismay walk hand in hand this day, for while we have at last brought the notorious Wolf Burglar of Kugane to justice, the Soboro Sukehiro was lost to us once more! In the affable yet enigmatic swordsman Jim, I was so certain we had found a new friend, but alas, when the opportunity presented itself, he absconded with Master Akebono's most legendary of swords. Disappointing as this turn of events may be, my faithful assistants and I must rally our spirits and resume the chase, for Jim must answer for his misdeeds!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
Although the Wolf Burglar is in the custody of the Sekiseigumi, the wandering swordsman Yojimbo and the Soboro Sukehiro are in the wind. Rejoined by Inspector Hildibrand, Nashu, and a certain gentlemanly zombie, you weigh your options and conclude that when at first you do not succeed, make inquiries of the townsfolk again, and pray that one divulges information of interest.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CHRHDB741_03150_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;A good investigation could perhaps be likened to a pot of stew, in that sometimes one needs to let it sit and simmer. Alas, it would seem that this might not be the case in this instance, for it is not for lack of developments that your inquiries bear little fruit. Rather, the people of Kugane express a shared reluctance to cooperate with any investigation given the detainment of the Wolf Burglar, who it seems is held in rather high regard due to the questionable morals of his targets and the generosity he has shown to the poor and downtrodden...</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CHRHDB741_03150_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;That the Wolf Burglar was so beloved of the people comes as a surprise to Shigure, who believed him devoid of redeeming qualities. Though the law is the law, he knows not how to proceed if the public is unwilling to cooperate...leading the others to suggest not only that he adopt a new guise for a time, but that they also question the Wolf Burglar himself, for a man so popular and trusted may be privy to secrets─and since both he and Yojimbo had designs on the Soboro Sukehiro, they may even be connected in some manner.

You and the others accompany Shigure to the gaol in which the Wolf Burglar is held, and together you appeal to his better nature and ask that he divulge any pertinent information. The Lupin is more than willing to do so...provided that he is set free. Naturally, Shigure is unwilling to even consider this condition for a moment, and it is only at the urging of Inspector Hildibrand and the others that he relents and states that he will request that the prisoner be released temporarily into his custody. Time being of the essence, the inspector and his assistant take matters into their own hands, using the occasion to present to Shigure a hair tonic of surpassing effectiveness that will restore to him his lost locks. The resulting explosion of light not only transforms Shigure's scalp into the envy of every follicly challenged man, but serves to blind the gaol guard and allow the Gentle Dead Man, aided by his werewolf attire, to switch places with the Lupin thief, after which the group beats a hasty retreat.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CHRHDB741_03150_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;The Wolf Burglar is free, and the Sekiseigumi appear to be none the wiser─for now. How long the deception will last remains to be seen, and so Shigure bids you follow him and the others into the waterways below, where your Lupin comrade seeks to find answers.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CHRHDB741_03150_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Away from the prying eyes of the law-abiding populace of Kugane, the Wolf Burglar introduces Shigure and the others to a merry band of rogues and scalawags. One of their number, Koju, is wary of placing his trust in a man of the Sekiseigumi, but the Lupin implores him not to be so quick to judge─and for Shigure to return the favor. Though Koju has no news of Yojimbo nor the Soboro Sukehiro to share, he assures you that, had the ronin attempted to sell the sword, he would have heard of it by now. This leads all present to deduce that Yojimbo may have stolen the sword for himself, and if he is indeed a collector of priceless and powerful weapons, then it stands to reason he would continue to seek out and obtain others. The only other comparable blade that comes to mind is the Ame-no-Murakumo, a fabled sword of eld said to have been wielded by the great kami Susano─with which you are intimately acquainted, as you inform the others. And so it is decided that the hunt for the samurai and the sword will continue in the Ruby Sea.</target>

The simplest course of action would be for him to change into his previous attire, but if your trials and travails with Inspector Hildibrand have taught you anything, it is that people do not always avail themselves of common sense...</target>
