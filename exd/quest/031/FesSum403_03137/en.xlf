Unfortunately, he possesses all the airborne grace of a sodden sponge and plunges unceremoniously in the water below. Fearing for his safety, R'majha rushes over to check on her crestfallen sibling.</target>

She explains her frustration at seeing her brother's jovial reaction to his abysmal performance on the obstacle course. R'fhul Tia has long claimed it his dream to become an adventurer, and as such, his sister expected him to treat the contest more seriously. She also expresses concern about his plans to leave home in search of fame and fortune. R'fhul Tia assures her that although he may be parted from his family, he will not place himself in unnecessary danger and will return safe and well. Once you are satisfied that the matter has been concluded, you return to Haermaga.</target>
