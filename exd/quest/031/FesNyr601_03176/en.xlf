        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR601_03176_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Upon your inquiry as to the reason behind the nezumi bugyo's troubled demeanor, he confesses that his efforts to glorify the rat this Heavensturn have not gone to plan. It transpires that he endeavored to tempt the seafaring citizens of Limsa Lominsa with rat-made advent cakes, which they found...unappetizing, to say the least. The bugyo believes that this may be due to cultural differences, as rats are seen as harbingers of fortune in his homeland. Though you suspect food made by rats will be a hard sell regardless of what cross-cultural understanding may be established─particularly as the bugyo's word choice in describing it leaves much to be desired─you agree to ask the locals what they find so off-putting about the rodents on his behalf.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR601_03176_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You approach Imania, a Lominsan who had previously refused the bugyo's offer of advent cakes. She makes clear that a lifetime of chasing rats &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;away&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; from her foodstuffs has not exactly endeared them to her, nor does she believe them capable of doing much more than spreading pestilence. Though she is convinced that she has the right of the matter, she indicates that you might seek out a second opinion.</target>

Unfortunately, before you can discuss the finer details, the mochi daikan appears and begins blathering about sentient mochi. Though the idea that advent cake mochi could come alive may be difficult to swallow, it is hardly weirder than anything else going on this Heavensturn, so you take his word for it and set off to quell the glutinous uprising before it can begin.</target>
