Kyusei reveals that he and his similarly clothed companions are in fact members of the Onishishu, a clandestine organization that researches ancient relics and maintains the aetherytes of Othard. He goes on to explain that Heaven&lt;var 1F /var&gt;on&lt;var 1F /var&gt;High was built thousands of years ago by his predecessors as a proving ground for warriors who would one day become protectors of the realm. The founder of the Confederacy was one such warrior and succeeded in besting Hiruko, the guardian of the thirtieth floor, before devoting his life to protecting the Ruby Sea. The Confederacy and the Onishishu have shared close ties ever since, and each Confederate leader must follow the founder's example by battling Hiruko. Kyusei hints at further mysteries involving Hiruko and the tower itself, the answers to which can be found at the Ten&lt;var 1F /var&gt;thousand&lt;var 1F /var&gt;year Pine.</target>
