        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDE102_03144_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Based on your information, Hien is of the opinion that Alphinaud indeed encountered some manner of trouble at the Burn. He suggests conducting a search of the wasteland upon flying mounts, and Yugiri bids you see to your preparations before joining them at the overlook near the House of the Fierce.</target>

※Challenge the Burn with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point.</target>

With no other recourse, you fight your way through hordes of fearsome desert creatures, as well as machina, inside what appear to be Allagan ruins. At length you emerge in an area of relative safety, and it is then that you spy the remains of the airship which bore Alphinaud away in the distance. Evidence of a battle abounds, but your friend and his traveling companions are nowhere to be seen. At Y'shtola's prompting, the party proceeds to scour the area for clues.</target>

While the implications of this discovery are unsettling, there is little more to be done at the crash site, and Yugiri suggests returning to the Doman Enclave to consider your next move.</target>
