According to the pair's tale, Dawkin came upon a member of the Continental Circus attempting to curse T'maritaa, and dove in front of her to shield her from a vegetative fate. Though she managed to escape unscathed, she was unable to leave the manor due to fear of recapture, and opted to hide instead. With the two reunited and the coast clear, they are finally free to return to the outside world.</target>
