				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESXMS403_03175_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Amh Garanjy is ecstatic that the choir performed better than anyone could have hoped. Now that the show has ended, it is time for the children attending the concert to receive their gifts. Unfortunately, a shortage of parcels leaves several youngsters disappointed, with one little girl in particular convinced that her own bad behavior is to blame. Her timing could not be worse, as she runs off in tears at the exact moment the Saint of Nymeia arrives with a whole shipment of presents for the Starlight Celebration. Amh Garanjy cannot help but wonder as to her whereabouts, and requests that you track down the wayward youngster.</target>

He clearly recalls seeing one heading in the direction of New Gridania. Although the fact she has already covered a considerable distance is a cause for concern, there must surely be others with useful information to share.</target>

With miraculous timing, as befitting the season, Maisenta appears with the very same dainty accessory that caught the child's eye. She explains that the girl's father had already bought it before she had asked, and that Maisenta herself had been holding on to it until the Starlight Celebration. The young runaway is overjoyed and dashes off to apologize to her father.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESXMS403_03175_MAISENTA_000_061&lt;tab&gt;I, on the other hand, have a rather more pressing engagement─I simply must change out of this unflattering costume. Although I suspect I may have to wear it again before the festival comes to a close. Well then, ta-ta for now!</target>

She does strike me as the sort of person to concern herself with distraught children, especially if she holds herself responsible. Be a dear and put her mind at ease, would you?</target>

I suppose she can add “cheering up crying children” to her lengthy list of talents. And you seem to have quite the knack for finding missing persons. I daresay that comes in handy from time to time!</target>

This is supposed to be a happy occasion, after all. If it gives even one youngling reason to be upset, it will have all been for naught.</target>
