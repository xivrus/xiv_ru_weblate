After recovering from this brief and unexpected diversion, Cid continues to share his thoughts on your next opponent, and proposes that he concentrate on devising a strategy for the inevitable confrontation with Omega. Meanwhile, you are to prepare to re-enter the test world, where the “supplementary” experiment is to take place. Within awaits a most formidable foe─a recreation of the legendary Midgardsormr himself!

The engineer's praise leads into a discussion about the similarities between your vanquished opponent and the primal Shinryu, with Cid musing that fate had a hand in the decision to awaken Omega. It seems the machine's connection to Midgardsormr arose from conflict on a distant star in the distant past, but it is the salvation of the immediate future which concerns you now...</target>
