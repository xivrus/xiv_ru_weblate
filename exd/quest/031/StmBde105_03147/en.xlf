Obtaining their consent will consequently be key. While they are unlikely to grant it lightly, Hien is convinced that gaining the support of such fearless warriors will be well worth the effort. Accordingly, you set out for Dotharl Khaa to treat with the tribe's khatun, Sadu.</target>

Satisfied with your work, you prepare to leave only for Magnai to accost Y'shtola wearing a curious expression. Despite trying to hack her to pieces but moments prior, the Sun is convinced that the Archon is his Nhaama, and propositions her with characteristic subtlety. Alas, his overtures are unceremoniously rejected, much to Sadu's amusement, prompting weapons to be drawn once more. Her patience spent, Y'shtola strides off back to Mol Iloh, and you and Hien follow, leaving the Xaela to their bickering.</target>
