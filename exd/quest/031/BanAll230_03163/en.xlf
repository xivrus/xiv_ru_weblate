However, one more problem presents itself: given his lax standards for the Three Wonders, it is unclear whether Jaab will make a Namazu of Yuzuka Manor or one from Dhoro Iloh his next target. To cover more ground, you and Kabuto agree to split up with the two Miqo'te and speak with Seigetsu the Enlightened whilst they investigate the situation in Yanxia.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANALL230_03163_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;As expected, you find Seigetsu the Enlightened at Dhoro Iloh. It transpires that a performance based on the “Grey Kings of Orient” carol is planned for the Seven Hundred Seventy-Seven's next festival activity, and they have been spreading word of it far and wide. Most interestingly, the production includes the role of “philosopher-king” and─though there clearly was significant disagreement on the subject─said role has long since been assigned to Gyorei. Judging that the temptation of a Namazu called “philosopher-king” would be irresistible to Nhaza'a, you conclude that Gyorei will almost certainly be his next target. Unfortunately, she is currently away from Dhoro Iloh on an errand, so you can only hope to catch up to her before Nhaza'a does.</target>
