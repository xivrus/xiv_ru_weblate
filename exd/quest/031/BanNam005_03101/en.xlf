Though he never manages to explain, one can safely assume that, were he given the opportunity, he would say that the Namazu must improve their festival, lest they be annihilated in seven years. Seven years! With that in mind, Seigetsu the Enlightened suggests that they incorporate a bizarre ritual so the festival will be more like the “unforgettable spectacles” once held by the Namazu of yore. Having concluded that Master Matoya would be the best source of information on such rituals, you stow Gyoshin in your bag once again and prepare to make for the Dravanian hinterlands.
