Since the storm, I've worked day and night to repair our homes, and the end is finally in sight. The last step is to coat the floors and foundations with resin that protects from water, but there's simply too much work for one pair of claws...</target>

In these humid climes, our elevated wooden floors are cooled by the air flowing upward and help keep flood waters from wetting our feet.</target>
