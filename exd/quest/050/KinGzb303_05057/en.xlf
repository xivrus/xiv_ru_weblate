        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZB303_05057_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With your encouragement, Murfurlur has decided to look for work as a bodyguard. He suspects that one of the many traveling Pelupelu merchants would likely have need of protection, but lacks the confidence to approach them in this capacity. And so, to better prepare himself, he asks that you help by training him first. Once you rendezvous with him south of the Shades of Grief, you may proceed with his education.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
