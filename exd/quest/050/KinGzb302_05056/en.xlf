        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Murfurlur remains curious about life as an adventurer and wonders if it may suit his skills as a former temple guardian. Upon hearing your description of an adventurer's duties, the Yok Huy recalls a craftsman who might be in need of such services. Yet rather than attempt to approach him on his own, Murfurlur asks that you once again show him how a professional would go about securing a new commission.

The material can be found in Naryor Gorna, but the wildlife there make it a dangerous proposition for those lacking in martial skill. Declaring that this is his trial, Murfurlur asks that you gather three chunks as a demonstration, after which he will see to the remainder.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZB302_05056_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;When the Yok Huy still held ambitions of conquest, obsidian weapons helped them to conquer Tural. These days, however, the material has been largely relegated to decorative trinkets, as the giants eventually recognized the metalworking of other races to be superior. After you receive this history lesson from the craftsman, Murfurlur appears with a bounty of obsidian and is duly compensated. Now that his first commission as an adventurer is complete, he bids you follow him that you might receive your share of the payment.</target>

Indeed, his enthusiasm led him to supply the craftsman with so much obsidian that he will likely not require his services for the foreseeable future, and it is unclear who else in the village might be in need of a stout former temple guardian. For now, however, he will consider his next steps, and perhaps seek your wisdom again should you be willing to provide it.</target>
