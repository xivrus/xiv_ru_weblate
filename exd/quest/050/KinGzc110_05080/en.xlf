I was nearly at Many Fires when it struck, so I urged my alpaca onwards through the whipping winds rather than seeking immediate shelter. Alas, when the storm settled, I discovered that those same winds had carried off half my stock.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZC110_05080_LOSSPELUPELU05080_000_002&lt;tab&gt;I should very much like to recover it, but I hear it told that the roads are plagued by brigands of late─another reason why I was keen to press on to the safety of Many Fires. And so I find myself torn over the wisest course of action: to write off my loss, or to speculate to re-accumulate?</target>

The items I lost are likely lying along the riverbank between here and Earthenshire─if you would take up the offer?</target>

If I had been the one to go back in search of them, I'd likely have lost my head to a bandit's axe or else washed over the falls to my doom!</target>

Never fear, though─for you have taught me that when in want of a sellsword, an adventurer will suffice!</target>
