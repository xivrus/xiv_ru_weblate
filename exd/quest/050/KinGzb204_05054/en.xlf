Initially suspicious of Nopli's intent, and doubtful of his eye for quality, Gigimolu's guard is gradually lowered through your periodic interventions during the negotiation, paving the way for Nopli to introduce the uolon bristle hairbrush. Taking a liking to the product, the Ul'dahn merchant eventually agrees to pay one hundred thousand pel per brush Nopli can offer.</target>
