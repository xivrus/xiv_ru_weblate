        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;It seems that Zeycihan, a professor of archaeology at the Studium, has recently discovered ancient ruins in Shaaloani. Unfortunately for him and his hired team of mercenaries, however, the fiends en route proved too great an obstacle to overcome, and thus the desperate scholar has come to plead─or rather, demand─your help in exploring the ruins instead. Being the charitable soul that you are, you agree to aid his cause, and make ready to meet him in the Pyariyoanaan Plain.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGYX101_05013_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;What Zeycihan neglected to mention is that in order to reach the ruins, one must first brave a valley teeming with prickly sabotenders. He goes on to explain that, while he believes the ruins to be Yok Huy in origin, he discovered archaeological motifs unrecognizable even to him. All of which is to say, you must be prepared to face anything─including a thousand thousand needles pointed in your direction.

Alas, they were struck by a great plague which spread like wildfire among their people, and despite their supplications to the slumbering serpent, the vast majority were ultimately forced to withdraw from the area to survive. Believed by the Yok Huy to govern the boundary between worlds, Zeycihan theorizes that it is no coincidence the great serpent awoke when you, an individual capable of crossing the rift, arrived.
