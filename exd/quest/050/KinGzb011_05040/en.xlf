Sleep does little to remedy his fatigue, and despite the protests of his stomach, he cannot eat. The Cornservant suspects the boy suffers from malnourishment as a result of eating corn and only corn. While the cuisines your corny companion can offer are limited, they manage to concoct a nutrient-packed corn soup to help the ailing Pelupelu.</target>
