As fortune would have it, they stopped in Wachunpelo upon hearing the rumbling of a stomach in need. Ever wont to see the people of Tural well-fed, they bid you help them offer aid to a peckish young Pelupelu.

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZB011_05040_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The peckish Pelupelu has been out of sorts of late. Sleep does little to remedy his fatigue, and despite the protests of his stomach, he cannot eat. The Cornservant suspects the boy suffers from malnourishment as a result of eating corn and only corn. While the cuisines your corny companion can offer are limited, they manage to concoct a nutrient-packed corn soup to help the ailing Pelupelu.</target>
