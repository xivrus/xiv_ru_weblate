        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZD001_05090_RRALTYUKUK_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Since the storm raged through these parts, we've seen a marked increase in the number of ill-tempered mantises. If left unchecked, they could prove a threat to the forest's natural balance.</target>

This has given the mantises a chance to flourish, but at the expense of everything else.</target>

I'm honored to have worked with one of Wuk Lamat's own!</target>
