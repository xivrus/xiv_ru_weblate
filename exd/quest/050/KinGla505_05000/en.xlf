Donuhanu presumes celebrations are in order, but Pashenine reveals that his most difficult challenge still lies ahead. He must slay a carnivorous tree, more lethal than all three defeated marks combined. His budding confidence is shaken in the face of this formidable foe, but Donuhanu is not willing to let the Whalaqee's journey end just yet. For every enemy, there is a fish that might defeat it, and the Hanuhanu seems certain that the cenotes of the Ja Tiika Heartland are home to the deadly fish that Pashenine needs. Donuhanu dashes off to catch it himself, which is by any standards, a dangerous lapse in judgment. You hurry to Yak T'el to fish your feathered friend out of trouble.</target>

Feathers ruffling in embarrassment, Donuhanu explains that Pashenine's arrival caused him to rethink his attitude towards his favorite fish. By gaining a thorough understanding of their qualities, he might yet prevail upon others to see their value, and thus make Fish Fancies Donuhanu a place to honor all odd fish.
