        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZB301_05055_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;While Murfurlur has heard of your victory over the Skyruin, he struggles to comprehend how one so small could have triumphed over the legendary vidraal, and so he asks that you favor him with a demonstration of your skill. There have been reports of large monsters threatening all who travel along the road leading to the Shades of Grief, which should prove a suitable challenge. Murfurlur bids you meet him there when you are ready to begin.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

He is unsure what new passion he should pursue next, though he is intrigued to learn that you developed your skills over the course of your adventures. You can but hope he will be closer to finding his answer when next you speak.</target>
