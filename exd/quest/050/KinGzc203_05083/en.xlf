Just as this thought is uttered, a group of Hanu approach you and one introduces herself as Zulihali. She then harangues Nahanshe for his ignorance of history and for his attitude during this ordeal, refusing to give the feathers and expressing disdain for the Landsguard. When asked why, she reveals that the sacred figure of Kixaihih was once destroyed by the Dawnservant and impresses upon Nahanshe that he must answer for his own conduct, or else. The overblown anger of Zulihali and her cohorts clearly perturbs Nahanshe, and he asks you to allow him some time to think.</target>
