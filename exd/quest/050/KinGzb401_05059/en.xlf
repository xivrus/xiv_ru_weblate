Murfurlur is in the market for a new client.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Though he is heartened by the praise he received for his first commission, Murfurlur is not content to wait for new clients to seek him out. He wishes to take the initiative and travel to Wachunpelo to sell his services, but is still concerned that the villagers there might be frightened by his presence. Once more he seeks to rely on you, this time asking if you happen to know any Pelupelu merchants who might be willing to employ a bodyguard. Fortunately, you might know just the one: Nopli, the merchant who recently came into possession of a cache of corrupted crystals.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Nopli explains that he wants to pay a visit to the Chirwagur and broker a deal for their salt, but has been reluctant to do so owing to their reputation for intimidating buyers into paying outrageous prices. Murfurlur is willing to accompany him, though he is concerned that this may be more difficult than Nopli anticipates, as the Chirwagur truly believe that might makes right. It is clear that he would like you to accompany them in case negotiations go poorly.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_KINGZB401_05059_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;As Murfurlur feared, the Chirwagur bristle at the thought of trading with Nopli, demanding that he surrender his coin and leave empty-handed. However, with your encouragement, the former temple guardian names himself, causing the other giants to back down in respect and giving the merchant an opening to explain why trading salt for corrupted crystals would benefit both parties. Though curious, most of the Chirwagur remain distrustful, but Murfurlur stands firm and vouches for the Pelupelu. Ultimately, the Chirwagur leave, unwilling to believe Nopli's promises...save for a single giant, who agrees to trade salt─a giant whom you previously met along with Vorporlor, and whom Wuk Lamat saved once before. Her deeds─and yours─have earned you a measure of trust, and in time, perhaps the others will change their minds as well.</target>

Indeed, it seems that this is only the beginning of a fruitful partnership between the Pelupelu merchant and Murfurlur, who thanks you again for your constant support, and states that he will always carry your memory in his heart.</target>
