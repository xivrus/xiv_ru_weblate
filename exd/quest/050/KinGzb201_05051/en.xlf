        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZB201_05051_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The enthusiastic merchant, Nopli, attempts to sell you what he believes to be rare and otherwise valuable corrupted crystals, only for you to inform him that they are, in fact, neither. He is both shocked by the revelation and dismayed at the untold sums of pel he squandered in their purchase. Though the peddler is naive, he is not one to be deterred, and so he begs your assistance in his pursuit to discover some modicum of worth in the crystals.
