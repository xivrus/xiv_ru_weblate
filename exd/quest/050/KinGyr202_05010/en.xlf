Not just for food, but for safety─hunting down those ill-made monstrosities whose very existence was inimical to our own.</target>

It was only after Gulool Ja Ja united Tural under the Dawnservant's crown that our role as protectors of the realm was made official.</target>

But from the very beginning, whenever that was, it's been about one thing and one thing only─protecting those who can't protect themselves. Don't forget that.</target>
