She has managed to ration what little unspoiled food remains thus far, but hunger tempts her to make a reckless choice. The Cornservant believes what she needs is food with longevity, and so they prepare a bounty of dried corn. The hungry Hanuhanu is moved by the generous offering. She thanks you profusely before leaving to share the good news with her family.</target>
