Chagrined to find the undeliverable letter must be returned to sender, yet quick to spot opportunity in adversity, he awards the awkward assignment to his trusted trainee, that you might gain valuable experience in dealing with the wrath of a disappointed customer. He bids you round the corner to the Octant, and return the letter to Bango Zango, the prickly vice-chair of the Brugaire Consortium.</target>

He asks that you assist him in tracking down the evasive Qiqirn. Journey to upper La Noscea, and question his younger brother, Memeroon, who runs a trading post on the banks of Bronze Lake.</target>

Among the Qiqirn's abandoned belongings, a hurriedly emptied chest piques the bagman's interest. However, if the local junkmonger is to be believed, the box contained naught but Mamool Ja currency─worthless to all but the lizardmen. The collector speculates that Jijiroon may have gone north to buy protection from the Mamool Ja, but is unwilling to follow the trader into beastman territory without a significant increase to his fee. Journey north, through the shallow reaches of Bronze Lake, and try to track Jijiroon down.</target>

With the mercenary's contract fulfilled, and Jijiroon in the collector's custody, all that remains is to return to Memeroon's Trading Post and inform his brother of all that befell.</target>

The dejected Qiqirn offers his trading post in payment for his brother's assistance, but Memeroon refuses, despite the boost to his fortunes that such a transaction would entail. For despite their differences, it is only his respect for Jijiroon's business brain that drives him to succeed. Henceforth do they pledge to compete against each other not as hated foes, but as respected rivals, and to usher in a new age of prosperity for their businesses both.</target>
