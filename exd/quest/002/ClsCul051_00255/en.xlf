Wishing to cheer him up, the guildmaster bids you make the poor soul one of his favorite dishes: grilled trout.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CLSCUL051_00255_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Instead of cheering him up, your expertly prepared grilled trout has the wholly unintended effect of humiliating Ingham, who interprets the gesture as a form of challenge. Happily, his urge to better your efforts prompts him to forget his woes, and he gifts you an amateur's culinary knife, that you might compete on an even footing. Now armed with a secondary tool, you continue along your chosen path.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Lyngsath upon reaching level 10.</target>
