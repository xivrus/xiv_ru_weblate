He attempts to use the lamb's power to put her─and you─to sleep, but the lamb rebels and blasts the bugyo instead. You escape unscathed, but the lamb is not so lucky. Activating her own magic without the proper preparation has exhausted her life force, and left her on the brink of oblivion. Reenergize the lamb with a /cheer of encouragement.</target>
