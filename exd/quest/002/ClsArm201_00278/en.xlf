        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSARM201_00278_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The forgemaster has asked you to speak with Blanstyr and glean his opinions on the running of the guild. That the irascible veteran might deem you worthy of his time, H'naanza suggests you offer him proof of your burgeoning skill in the form of a materia-enhanced iron hoplon. Unfortunately, the guild cannot spare the necessary materials, leaving you with two options: buy what you need from Hawkers' Alley, or mine the iron yourself. Should you require an explanation on materia, the forgemaster recommends that you seek the counsel of the goblin Mutamix, who resides at a camp in central Thanalan.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSARM201_00278_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You have approached Blanstyr bearing a materia-enhanced iron hoplon. Though notoriously unforgiving of the slightest flaw, the artisan seems well pleased with your work on the shield. After praising your dedication and skill, Blanstyr shares his thoughts on an armorer's duty and on the current─to his mind, disastrous─course of the guild. Caught between two opposing viewpoints, you resolve to put both from your mind and focus on your own development.

※The next armorer quest will be available from H'naanza upon reaching level 25.</target>

Instead, I must find a way to soften the old buzzard's stance, and for that, I require your assistance. He will not unfold his thoughts to me, but mayhap he will to you. Don't look so surprised─you're one of the few armorers in this place whom he wouldn't see cast out.</target>
