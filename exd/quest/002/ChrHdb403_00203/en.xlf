Hearing that the eight-legged receptionist hastily discarded several crates of rubbish from his office, he bids you go to Pearl Lane to recover any potential evidence.</target>

One such man appears when Hildibrand rushes to the scene and, after expressing displeasure at Briardien not including him in his investigation, quickly launches into a paean to his mother's recipe for roasted truffles, as Syntgoht listens intently.
