To supplement Granae's work, Forgemaster H'naanza has requested that you craft twelve sheets of bronze plate and deliver them directly to the novice, hoping that your good example might inspire her to display similar diligence.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSARM101_00276_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You have delivered the bronze plate to Granae. Her head swimming with visions of the fantastic armor she would forge, it seems the novice deemed her more mundane─though equally important─tasks unworthy of her time and effort. The sight of your exacting work, however, has convinced her otherwise. After promising to improve on her fundamental techniques, Granae suggests that you seek out T'mokkri at the Drowning Wench and try your hand at a few tradecraft leves.

※The next armorer quest will be available from H'naanza upon reaching level 15.</target>
