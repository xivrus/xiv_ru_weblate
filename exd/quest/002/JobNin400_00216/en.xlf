Having received word that the imperial espionage unit under Karasu's command means to target Captain Grymuwil of the Bloody Executioners, Oboro intends to ascertain the traitor's whereabouts by interrogating one Wolfstan, the captain's trusted lieutenant. Make for Camp Bronze Lake in upper La Noscea, where Oboro will brief you in detail on the plan of attack.</target>
