His battle with Karasu has left the shinobi a changed man. No longer willing or able to repress his true self, he has chosen to forsake obligation in favor of following his own heart's desire, which urges him to seek out the truth behind the traitor he hunted for so long. Prepared to face the answer he fears the most, he has resolved to undertake this final mission alone, insisting that Tsubame and you have sacrificed enough on his behalf. No sooner does he leave than Tsubame steps out from the shadows, looking very concerned at his words.</target>

She explains that she, too, has come to a resolution─to fight at Oboro's side─and has no intention of being denied. Recalling the dying Karasu's last words, Tsubame suggests that you make for Candlekeep Quay and question the guards about any happenings of note in the area.</target>

Though it appears that Oboro is already in the area, Tsubame deems it too dangerous to search for him and attempt to make contact at this time, preferring to observe the area from a safe distance until Master Gekkai shows himself.

Confronted by his former pupil, Gekkai shows no remorse, coolly explaining how he made a simple decision to seek out a stronger master, while at the same time guaranteeing the safety of his village over that of countless Doman commonfolk that were of no import to him. Incensed by his one-time master's callous disdain for the nation he called home, Oboro draws his blade and swears vengeance, and together you, he, and Tsubame defeat the shinobi master. After the battle, Karasu returns from his self-staged death to bequeath to you the final piece of your ninja garb, and to Oboro the soul crystal that will allow him to go home to a hero's welcome, before walking off to parts unknown. His long mission finally at an end, Oboro returns to the dock storehouse. Meet him there to say your farewells.</target>

While the two shinobi initially intended to return home together, Oboro has decided to remain behind to continue his study of Eorzean culture, in hopes of bringing new schools of thought back to his home. From your experiences traveling with Oboro and Tsubame and fighting at their side, it would seem that the future of the village is in good hands.
