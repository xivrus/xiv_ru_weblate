A delegation from the Far East has set to shore in Eorzea to lead the festivities. But while the townspeople choose their new year's resolutions, the leader of the Easterlings seems singularly lacking in resolve. Speak with the hitsuji bugyo, lest the dark clouds that gather on his brows usher in a year of sorrows.

Convinced that an Eorzean adventurer would have better luck, he recruits you to the Force's propaganda arm. But an immediate problem stalls your progress─the prototype tender lamb refuses to acknowledge your existence. Perhaps a taste of the special fodder the bugyo has ordered through Engerrand, a trader in Hawkers' Alley, might help to win her over.</target>
