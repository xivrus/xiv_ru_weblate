It would seem Yayake's name has been mentioned in connection with that of her former guildmaster, Mumuepo, whom the Blades believe to have fomented unrest in Ul'dah. The disgraced thaumaturge is currently remanded in the Coliseum, where he is forced to fight until his debt to society is repaid. Recalling the way Yayake once idolized the man, Cocobuki is eager to investigate the prelate's recent activities, and asks for your assistance. By way of a first step, speak with Yayake herself, and check for any signs of suspicious activity.</target>
