He reveals that he once was a member of the Purple Haze─until Hildibrand and a flower girl named Myrtha allowed him to escape from that life. Now, Wymond intends to trap the criminals using the markets of Ul'dah, and bids you speak with Seseroga at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange to purchase ceruleum with a banknote.</target>
