As you have done thus far, you must pretend to cooperate with the twisted troupe, that you might uncover the details of its dark plot. Speak with the unsavory illusionist by the entrance to the Ruby Road Exchange, and offer your services to her.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

It would seem that the Continental Circus had been misled all this time, and the citizens are perfectly safe. So ends your quest to forestall the Night of Devilry.
