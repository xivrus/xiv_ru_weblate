Oboro utterly loses control of his emotions, turning against his foe in a blind, frenzied rage, which seems to please Karasu all the more. Suggesting that this is what he had hoped to see in his rival, the traitor agrees to a battle to the death─a battle in which Oboro and you prove victorious. Oboro is about to claim Karasu's life when your flamboyant foe spins a curious tale that suggests the true traitor of Doma was none other than the trusted teacher of the two shinobi, Master Gekkai. Oboro scoffs, dismissing Karasu's words as pathetic lies, but his expression betrays a heart in turmoil. Karasu cryptically reveals the name of a single location─Candlekeep Quay─before taking to the air and self-immolating in a burst of glory as his rival stands there nonplussed. Speak with Oboro and see how he has handled this unexpected turn of events.</target>
