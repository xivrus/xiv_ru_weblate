        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL251_00260_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Thanks to your dried prunes, Diving Dove seems much less tense than before. However, Lyngsath is still not convinced that the woman is as healthy as she should be, and bids you make her a hearty meal of aldgoat steak. Alas, Diving Dove is known to mislike both the taste and texture of the meat. Clearly, it will take some effort to make the dish palatable to her.</target>

As before, it does not take long for her to see through your deception, but she is nevertheless impressed that you were able to make her enjoy aldgoat. Encouraged by her words, you continue along your chosen path.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Lyngsath upon reaching level 30.</target>

I began my career there, but soon grew weary of all the charlatans masquerading as gourmands. To hear them speak, one would assume that gold leaf was an essential part of every meal. That is why I came to Limsa Lominsa.</target>
