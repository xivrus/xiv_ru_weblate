        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE410_00078_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;At the Observatorium, Ilberd furnishes you and Alphinaud with a progress report on his hunt for the Ivy. It is revealed that one of the imperial spy's confederates, a Flame stationed at Revenant's Toll, had been selling secrets to the merchant you apprehended, who had in turn been passing information to the heretics. Yet even as this revelation explains how the heretics came to possess knowledge of the caravan routes, it raises the question of how they and the imperial agents might be connected. Could it be a purely financial arrangement, or something more worrying? Whatever the answer, Ilberd seems confident that he is drawing closer to discovering the Ivy's identity. After issuing the captain further orders, Alphinaud bids you accompany him to an emergency meeting between Alliance leaders. Speak with him again to be informed of the particulars.</target>
