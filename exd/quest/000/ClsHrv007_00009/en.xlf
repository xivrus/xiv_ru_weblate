All hope is not lost, however, for the pears are known to grow in the wilderness. Solyeux at Bentbranch Meadows should be able to point you in their general direction.</target>

Though you have saved the day, Fufucha reminds you that nature is capricious, and that her bounty cannot be taken for granted. Keeping these words close to heart, you continue your journey along the path of the botanist.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha upon reaching level 35.</target>
