However, since you have not heard anything worth investigating, the boy bids all the Doman Adventurers' Guild spread out, and see what they can learn from the passing travelers. Rokka stops briefly to ask that you enjoin Rhesh Polaali to stay safe. See to it that the message is passed along.</target>

However, the former Crystal Brave has heard worrying tidings. It seems a valuable grimoire was stolen from Rowena's establishment, and a witness saw four short people around the time of the crime. As such, the Adventurers' Guild suspects that the Doman children may have played a part in the theft. Unwilling to believe they had anything to do with it, Rhesh Polaali bids you intercede on their behalf with Slafborn.</target>

The Adventurers' Guild is indeed investigating the children in relation to the theft. While Slafborn himself doubts they would be capable of such, the facts nevertheless do point in the Domans' direction. Knowing that you are a friend to the younglings, he asks that you speak with them on the guild's behalf. Locate the four children, and ascertain what they know.</target>

Rokka supposes that they are Lalafells, and Koharu realizes she has seen a gang of four recently come to town. With this in mind, Yozan begins to plan.
