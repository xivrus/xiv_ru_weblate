				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_GAIUSE405_00062_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Having discerned Iceheart's true motive for attacking the supply caravan, Alphinaud quickly devises a plan of action. You and he will journey to Whitebrim Front and speak with Lord Drillemont, whose knights have been scouring Coerthas for the heretics ever since your encounter with them near Snowcloak. With luck, he will have information which may lead you to their lair.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_GAIUSE405_00062_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;According to Lord Drillemont, a party of pilgrims resembling those who attacked the caravan was seen transporting a large number of crates towards Snowcloak, where they vanished without a trace. Convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that Iceheart's followers have gone to ground somewhere in the vicinity, Ser Aymeric declares that his Temple Knights will join in the hunt for Iceheart. Not to be outdone, Alphinaud responds that he has already summoned a unit of Crystal Braves to Whitebrim Front for the same purpose. With so formidable a force devoted to the task, the heretics cannot hope to remain hidden for long. Alphinaud, however, would leave nothing to chance, and bids you explore other ways in which Iceheart might be found.</target>
