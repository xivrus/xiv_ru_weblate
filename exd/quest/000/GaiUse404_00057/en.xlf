        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE404_00057_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The route taken by the caravan was known only to a few, yet by all accounts, the ambush laid by the heretics was executed flawlessly─a fact which does not escape Aymeric's subordinate. In spite of this, Alphinaud believes that a thorough examination of the ambush site must be conducted before pursuing other avenues of inquiry. Travel to Boulder Downs and question the House Fortemps knights keeping watch there.</target>

Disguised as pilgrims, Iceheart and her brethren slaughtered the caravan's guards, and the young man only survived by feigning his own death. As he lay still in the snow, he heard the heretics speak of “Shiva's resurrection”─the thought of which fills the squire with disbelief and dread in equal measure. Alphinaud must know what the squire saw.</target>
