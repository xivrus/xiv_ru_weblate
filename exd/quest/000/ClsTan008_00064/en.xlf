Realizing that she could not prevent others from copying her creations, Geva swore a vow that the next line of Geva toadskin bags would be made with an eye towards economy, and that the patterns used would enable inexperienced leatherworkers to reproduce her designs with minimal waste. However, as an artisan worthy of the Fen&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Yll name, you do not need to rely upon her patterns. Filled with pride in seeing you uphold the guild's high standards, she encourages you to continue your efforts.
