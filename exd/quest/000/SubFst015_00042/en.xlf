So much so, in fact, that last night they left us a token of their appreciation...in the form of vegetables. A &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;lot&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; of vegetables.</target>

And it's not as if I don't have enough to do already. In short, I'd be most grateful for any help you could give me.</target>

That said, I &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;do&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; wish they would find other ways to express their gratitude. We have no need of vegetables here, but mayhap the Carline Canopy can make use of them. Anyway, thanks be to the elementals for bringing you here today.</target>
