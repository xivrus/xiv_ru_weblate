By the time she was well enough for duty, the organization was gone. She has found work as a guard in Revenant's Toll, a posting that keeps her quite busy. She has left one errand unattended, namely returning earrings to Rokka, one of the Doman children who healed her back to health. Thus, she leaps at your offer to find the girl for her, and tells you to speak with Rowena, as the children have been seen in her establishment.</target>

In the past, the settlers survived the hard days and long nights deep in their cups. They took to calling their wine “treasure,” which then attracted some more dim-witted adventurers to the dangerous land. Worried, the frontier hands then came up with a ludicrous horror story to keep these unwanted people away. As time went on, the tales of “treasure” faded to legend. Find Yozan outside of Rowena's establishment, and relay this information.</target>
