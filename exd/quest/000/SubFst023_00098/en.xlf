Oh, it's a &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;lovely&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; drink, absolutely bursting with nutrients and goodness. I'll have you know I always drink at least one cup a day! Alas, few people share my &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;passion&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; for healthy living... Truth be told, most won't touch the stuff─not unless you add microchu leaflets, anyway. Apparently, the taste and the smell are too distracting or some such nonsense.</target>
