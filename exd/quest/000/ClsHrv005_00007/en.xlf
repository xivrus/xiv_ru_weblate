				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CLSHRV005_00007_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In order to grow as a botanist, you must be mindful that the tools you use are appropriate to your level of proficiency. To this end, Fufucha tells you about materia─a special kind of crystal that can be used to enhance gear. The enhancement process once required certain catalysts found throughout nature, and though they are no longer in use, Fufucha believes that gathering them would provide you with a suitable challenge. Take yourself to Aleport in western La Noscea, and there obtain fifteen fragments of grade 1 carbonized matter. Once you have collected enough, present the fragments to Sandre at the Botanists' Guild.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CLSHRV005_00007_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You listen with interest as Sandre explains that materia is extracted from old equipment and attached to still-useful gear, thereby enhancing its properties. The carbonized matter you have gathered is a type of catalyst that was once essential to the attachment process. If you would learn more about materia, Sandre recommends you visit the goblin Mutamix, who has his camp at the Bonfire in central Thanalan.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha upon reaching level 25.</target>

It is a kind of crystal that can be used to enhance the efficacy of gear. In the past, the enhancement process required certain catalysts found throughout nature, the gathering of which was our domain, but new methods have rendered them obsolete.</target>

Now, I'd thank you not to ask me about the workings of it─that sort of scholarly stuff is beyond my fathoming. If you wish to know more─perhaps even try your hand at crafting with materia─I suggest you seek out the goblin Mutamix. It's said he has his camp at a place called the Bonfire, out in the wilds of central Thanalan.</target>
