        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSHRV005_00007_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In order to grow as a botanist, you must be mindful that the tools you use are appropriate to your level of proficiency. To this end, Fufucha tells you about materia─a special kind of crystal that can be used to enhance gear. The enhancement process once required certain catalysts found throughout nature, and though they are no longer in use, Fufucha believes that gathering them would provide you with a suitable challenge. Take yourself to Aleport in western La Noscea, and there obtain fifteen fragments of grade 1 carbonized matter. Once you have collected enough, present the fragments to Sandre at the Botanists' Guild.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSHRV005_00007_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You listen with interest as Sandre explains that materia is extracted from old equipment and attached to still-useful gear, thereby enhancing its properties. The carbonized matter you have gathered is a type of catalyst that was once essential to the attachment process. If you would learn more about materia, Sandre recommends you visit the goblin Mutamix, who has his camp at the Bonfire in central Thanalan.

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha upon reaching level 25.</target>
