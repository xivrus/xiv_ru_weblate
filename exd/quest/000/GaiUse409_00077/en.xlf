And how differently would we view the world had we a better understanding of its past? Little is known of Shiva's life and deeds, yet the heretics venerate her as a saint. Ser Aymeric's ancestors are said to have founded Ishgard by the will of Halone, yet he admits that scripture only tells so much. Ultimately, however, the details of his people's war with the dragons are irrelevant. Regardless of how the conflict began, it is destined to continue─unless Iceheart's plan succeeds, which the Scions cannot allow. While Minfilia and the others search for a means to breach Iceheart's sanctuary, you are to assist Yuyuhase and the 3rd Unit Braves in tracking down the heretics who attempted to ambush the allied forces.</target>

It would seem to be an escape plan devised in the aftermath of the heretics' failed ambush at Snowcloak. The plan mentions a rendezvous point near the Observatorium, as well as a merchant sympathetic to the heretics' cause.
