        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE412_00080_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;After joining Ilberd at Sweetbloom Pier, the two of you are met by Yugiri, who informs you that Eline Roaille is headed in the direction of the Hawthorne Hut. However, your reunion with the Garlean spy must wait, for another matter requires your immediate attention. An imperial squadron has set forth from Castrum Oriens on a mission to destroy an Alliance communications-jamming device in the South Shroud. If they succeed, Eline Roaille may well abort her secret rendezvous, thus depriving you of the chance to secure damning evidence of her treachery. Make haste to the South Shroud, and seek out the shinobi at Quarrymill who will brief you on the situation.</target>
