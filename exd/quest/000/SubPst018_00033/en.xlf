The joyous moment is interrupted by Maisenta of Black Rabbit Traders, the Homunculi's long-standing patron, who is most distressed to hear that her beloved band will be breaking their partnership and seeking sponsorship elsewhere. Sensing something amiss with the Ul'dahn trader's offer, she solicits your aid. Rendezvous with her out of earshot beneath the bridge near the Leatherworkers' Guild.</target>

Though she swears that she was not complicit in the attacks on the Black Rabbit supply wagons, she acknowledges that her single-minded pursuit of profit caused her to turn a blind eye to the underside of her chosen partners, obstructing Maisenta's efforts at honest trade and putting innocent lives at stake. Maisenta, ever willing to make a deal, offers to look the other way in exchange for Rishushu's promise that she will meddle with neither the Homunculi nor Black Rabbit Traders' business again. Observing their patron's ruthless relentlessness in achieving her aims, the honey-tongued bards are quick to change their tune and sing Maisenta's praises. With a revitalized Black Rabbit Traders backing them, their long-awaited realm-wide debut is doubtless close at hand.</target>
