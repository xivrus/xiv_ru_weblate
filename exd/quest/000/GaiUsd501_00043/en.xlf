Urianger suggests that she return to the connecting fragments of Dalamud in your company, in hopes that your presence will set events in motion, as it has so often in the past. In the meantime, the Archon promises to seek answers of his own. Make your way to the fragment situated at the Burning Wall in eastern Thanalan, and speak with Alisaie's assistant who has been reconnoitering the site.</target>
