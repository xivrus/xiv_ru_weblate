After a lengthy discussion with Urianger, the Antecedent has concluded that the Scions in Revenant's Toll lack the expertise to develop a solution and must therefore turn to another for assistance─a Sharlayan colleague who is currently en route to Mor Dhona. Minfilia invites you to accompany her to the northern gates, where she intends to greet the newcomer's arrival.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE414_00082_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;While you and Minfilia converse upon matters deep and profound, a carriage arrives in Revenant's Toll. A tall Roegadyn woman disembarks from it, whom Minfilia introduces to you as Moenbryda, an accomplished Sharlayan scholar and an authority on aetheryte technologies. Now that your new colleague has arrived, it would seem a good time to trouble Minfilia for a plan of action.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE414_00082_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Eager to resolve the situation in Snowcloak, Minfilia and Moenbryda return to the Rising Stones.

Setting her mind to the problem of the missing aetheryte, she quickly devises a solution involving white auracite, a material she has been researching for the purpose of capturing Ascian souls. By using it to channel a burst of concentrated aether into the aetheryte by which Iceheart escaped, she believes she can recreate the beacon at the opposite end. If successful, it should theoretically be possible for you to teleport to it. Should it fail, of course, any such attempt would result in your death─a painless death, to be sure, but a permanent one nonetheless.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE414_00082_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Wait for the carriage outside Revenant's Toll.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE414_00082_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Minfilia.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE414_00082_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Minfilia.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE414_00082_MINFILIA_000_000&lt;tab&gt;As you may recall, Iceheart used the aetheryte in the depths of Snowcloak to teleport a short distance to the west─most likely to a sanctuary of some description.
