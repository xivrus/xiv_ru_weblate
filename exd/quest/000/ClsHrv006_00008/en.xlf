Her premise thus established, Fufucha tells you that an order has arrived from Ul'dah for no fewer than two thousand sprigs of chamomile. The herb is known to grow around Oakwood in upper La Noscea. Harvest fifteen sprigs by way of your contribution to the group effort, and deliver them to Sandre.</target>

※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha upon reaching level 30.</target>

...I jest, of course! A task of this scale will require more than two hands. If you would be so good as to procure, say, fifteen sprigs, I would consider it an appropriate contribution.</target>
