Her premise thus established, Fufucha tells you that an order has arrived from Ul'dah for no fewer than two thousand sprigs of chamomile. The herb is known to grow around Oakwood in upper La Noscea.

Trade may flourish between nations, but it would seem that old prejudices die hard.

So run along and harvest them, would you?
...I jest, of course! A task of this scale will require more than two hands. If you would be so good as to procure, say, fifteen sprigs, I would consider it an appropriate contribution.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSHRV006_00008_FUFUCHA_000_4&lt;tab&gt;Chamomile is well known for its fragrant aroma and soothing properties.
