        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE406_00069_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In an effort to weed out any enemy sympathizers within the ranks, Lord Drillemont ordered a covert evaluation of all stationed in Whitebrim Front. One man in his service was thus identified as a possible heretic, though these suspicions have yet to be confirmed. If the suspect is indeed in league with the heretics, Lord Drillemont believes he will attempt to warn his allies of the impending search operation. Observe the man as he reports to Ser Jeantremont in the yard and discreetly track his movements.</target>

Though you cannot make out the entirety of their conversation, it is clear that the stranger is one of the heretics, and that the movements of the Temple Knights and the Crystal Braves are already known to them. Worse, it seems that the heretics have formulated a plan to prevent the allied forces from completing their search─though quite what role the tunnels in Boulder Downs will play you cannot say. Perhaps Lord Drillemont will be able to make sense of things.</target>
