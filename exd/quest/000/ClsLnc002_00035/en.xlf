The sneering spearman, who introduces himself as Foulques, proceeds to declare your prize a counterfeit before challenging you to find the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;true&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; stone, which he claims to have secreted in the depths of Spirithold.

It is these qualities, and not blind daring, that he would have you keep in mind as you continue your training.
