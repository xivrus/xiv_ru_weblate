Not even the threat posed by the VIIth Legion was enough to coax the reclusive nation back to the negotiating table. Now, however, after two decades of near silence, they have reached out─but to what end? Regardless of Ser Aymeric's agenda, Alphinaud is resolved to advance his own. Travel with him to Camp Dragonhead and speak with Lord Haurchefant upon your arrival.</target>

Alas, the ambassador is not easily swayed, and it becomes apparent that the Holy See has no intention of rejoining the Eorzean Alliance. However, Ser Aymeric eventually reveals that he came to the meeting with a different purpose in mind... You learn that the astrologians of Ishgard have foretold the return of Midgardsormr─the fallen guardian of Silvertear Falls─and that Ser Aymeric wishes to enlist the Scions' aid in keeping watch over the great wyrm's remains. In exchange, he will ensure that the shipments of aid from House Fortemps to Revenant's Toll will continue unabated. Content with the arrangement, Alphinaud agrees─only to learn moments after that the latest shipment has been waylaid by Iceheart and her followers...</target>
