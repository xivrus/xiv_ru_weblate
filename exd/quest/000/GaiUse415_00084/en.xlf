Though she believes with all her heart that you will survive, she nevertheless thanks you for all you have done in service to the realm. Bid farewell to the Antecedent and rendezvous with Alphinaud at Snowcloak.</target>

The scholar then directs the flow into the nearby aetheryte, which begins to glow brightly. At Moenbryda's instruction, you attune to the giant crystal, opening a path to Iceheart's sanctuary...probably. Speak with Alphinaud one last time before teleporting to only the gods know where.</target>

However, before you do so, he bids you speak with the stalwart Temple Knight, who bears a missive from Ser Aymeric addressed to you.</target>
