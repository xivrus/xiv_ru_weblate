        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBFST014_00041_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Like all good Gridanians, Samiane treats her belongings with respect and is loath to discard them before they reach the end of their useful lives. An admirable stance, to be sure, but one which leads to disaster when her venerable seed pouch splits, depositing its cargo of Azeyma rose hips in her wake. Help the unfortunate botanist by gathering the lost rose hips strewn along the road to the Greatloam Growery.</target>

Though some seeds may have sprouted where they fell, she explains that all botanists consider it their responsibility to raise the Twelveswood's flora in the best possible conditions. That said, she concedes that a rose-lined path might not have been so bad...</target>
