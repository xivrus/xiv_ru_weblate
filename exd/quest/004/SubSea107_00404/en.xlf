Lyulf is momentarily disappointed until he recalls a comment his father once made concerning the success of his family's crops.

He scrawled down a fair bit of nonsense in that ratty, dog-eared tome, but as I was leafing through the pages one day, I found a passage entitled “For the Future.” It described the location where my father had buried his “earthly wealth,” in an area that was once a bustling neighborhood.</target>
