Lyulf is momentarily disappointed until he recalls a comment his father once made concerning the success of his family's crops. With seeds that thrive even in the most barren soil, the farmer hopes to soon see the day when the desolate fields of Swiftperch are transformed into a golden sea of swaying wheat.</target>

He scrawled down a fair bit of nonsense in that ratty, dog-eared tome, but as I was leafing through the pages one day, I found a passage entitled “For the Future.” It described the location where my father had buried his “earthly wealth,” in an area that was once a bustling neighborhood.</target>
