The beasts were duly slain, though not before wreaking considerable havoc, and so it comes as little surprise that your petition for asylum will not be heard until the threat to Ishgard has diminished. For the time being, Lord Haurchefant invites you and Alphinaud to join your companions in the intercessory. Speak with the knight stationed outside to gain entry, and find out who awaits you within.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE616_00428_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;To your surprise, you find Tataru and Yugiri waiting for you in the intercessory, the refugee leader having rescued the young receptionist from Crystal Braves in Limsa Lominsa. Together, you learn, they traveled to the Waking Sands, where Urianger cast a powerful glamour to mask the presence of those taking refuge within. This small blessing is soon tempered by the realization that, aside from you and Alphinaud, every other Scion who attended the banquet remains unaccounted for. Succumbing to a fit of melancholy, Alphinaud curses himself for being blind to the traitors in his midst, and foolishly believing that he could save the world single-handedly. Seeing this, Lord Haurchefant and Tataru remind him that all is not lost─that they still have allies to whom they can turn. With these words ringing in their ears, the remnants of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn resolve to resume their journey, and seek their redemption...one step at a time.

※The next main scenario quest will be available from Alphinaud once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE616_00428_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with the House Fortemps guard.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE616_00428_ALPHINAUD_000_010&lt;tab&gt;...Who managed to escape?
