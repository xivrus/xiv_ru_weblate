He sends you on your way, but not before warning you of recent rumors that the good captain has been acting strange of late. Nevertheless, the deputy postmoogle bids you safe travels, that the letter makes it safely to the hands of Captain Landenel.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBPST026_00496_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You deliver the letter to Landenel, who greets you with a warm smile. However, the smile does not last, for the letter bears ill news: his beloved mentor, the former leader of the Company of Heroes, has passed away, and a memorial service is to be held in his honor. In a baffling development, the service will be hosted by none other than Wheiskaet, who had but recently agreed to help Landenel search for their commander. Landenel expresses his intent to go to Costa del Sol to demand an explanation from Wheiskaet, and requests your presence at the meeting lest he do something he will later regret.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBPST026_00496_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Landenel is awaiting your arrival at Costa del Sol, seemingly calm yet exasperated. To his surprise and relief, Wheiskaet can only express bewilderment as he reads the anonymous missive, claiming to have no knowledge of the commander's death nor any plans for a memorial service. Landenel is relieved to hear this news, and reaffirms his intention to resign from the Wood Wailers to search for their commander. However, Landenel's renewed fervor to abandon his duties forces Wheiskaet to reconsider the purpose of the letter. Nearly certain of the missive's writer and their intent, he refuses to assist Landenel. Now blinded by anger, Landenel readies his spear to run his former captain through. Try reasoning with him to /soothe his temper.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBPST026_00496_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Your words have reached Landenel, and he sheathes his spear with reluctance. Wheiskaet is disappointed by his friend's behavior, but before he can reason with his troubled comrade, Landenel storms off in search of better prospects for aid in his search. With a heavy heart, Wheiskaet confides in you the truth of Landenel's sorrowful past, making it clear why the distraught Wood Wailer holds his leader and mentor in such high regard. Though Landenel made no mention of where he would go, Wheiskaet knows him all too well, and suspects he has gone to Wineport in search of Shamani, a former member of the Company of Heroes. Follow him to Wineport, and see if he has found the counsel he needs.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBPST026_00496_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;You quickly confirm Wheiskaet's suspicions, finding Landenel recounting his visit to Costa del Sol to Shamani. Landenel is convinced that Wheiskaet no longer cares for their former commander, but Shamani can only disagree with his assumptions. Considering all that has transpired, he deduces who is behind the invitation, and is disappointed to find Landenel still remains oblivious to who would be so concerned for his well-being. Shamani then reminds him of who, above all others, was there to guide him in the Company of Heroes─their leader. A mention of his old company motto calls to mind his first meeting with the commander, and a hint to his whereabouts. Follow him to Costa del Sol, and see if his intuition is on the mark.</target>
