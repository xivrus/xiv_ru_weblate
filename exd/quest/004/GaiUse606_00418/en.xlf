				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_GAIUSE606_00418_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You look on in silence as Alphinaud delivers an impassioned plea for assistance to the Alliance leaders. But despite his best efforts, he is unable to persuade them to pledge more than a token force to aid in Ishgard's defense. Citing local concerns more deserving of their resources, the leaders refuse to provide meaningful assistance, and suggest instead that you assemble a contingent of elite adventurers, similar to the company that proved so effective during Operation Archon. With that, the council is dissolved, and you are ushered out onto the Royal Promenade. Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on the day's proceedings.</target>

Wasting no time, the Crystal Brave commander dispatches his forces, and requests that you and your fellow adventurers assemble on the Steps of Faith, ready to repel the Horde. Make your way to the Gates of Judgement in the Coerthas central highlands, and report to Ser Marcelain.</target>
