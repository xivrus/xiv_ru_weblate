Meanwhile, after sending her men out in pursuit of the escaped thief, Phillice of the Sultansworn confesses that she is the last of the Arbiters of Truth─the thief's final target─and states her intention to go into hiding so as not to place any more lives in danger. Hildibrand assures her that he has the situation entirely under control, and promptly enlists your aid in canvassing the area for any suspicious individuals.
