If this species is indeed alien to the island, it must be located and destroyed immediately, before it is allowed to reproduce and possibly disturb the natural balance found here amongst the area's fauna.</target>

The odor should draw forth whatever creatures lurk beneath, leaving them easy targets.</target>
