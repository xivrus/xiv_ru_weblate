But while she would rather remain at the Rising Stones and focus on her work, she recognizes that this is a time for celebration, and that the Scions of the Seventh Dawn must stand united as a beacon of hope to all.

Riol also divulges that Wilred had begun to ask pointed questions, which likely led to his demise at the hands of these traitors.
