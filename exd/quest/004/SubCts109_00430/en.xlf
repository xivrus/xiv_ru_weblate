New evil festers within the castle walls, and its source is voidsent invoked by an unknown fiend. While the mystery of the summoner can wait, the voidsent threat must be destroyed with all haste for the good of the Shroud. Adestan bids you speak with Maxinne, the guard watching over Amdapor Keep, that you might behold the terrors within for yourself.</target>

The Lambs of Dalamud's dark rites had been complete but for blood. When you purged them, their vitality ran forth over the ground, and brought their foul rituals to fruition. Adestan wonders if the voidsent drew the Lambs to Amdapor in the first place, before dismissing such theories as improbable. He nevertheless thanks you for restoring peace to the Shroud.</target>
