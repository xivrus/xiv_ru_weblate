Concerned that something may be amiss with the elementals, he has committed the details of his sightings to parchment, and bids you deliver the document to Miounne.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_MANFST006_00446_LUQUELOT_000_2&lt;tab&gt;Of late, I have noticed that Ixali dirigibles have been appearing over the Twelveswood with increasing regularity.

Yet the birdmen have been coming and going as they please, with nary a sign of protest from the guardians of the Twelveswood.</target>
