Concerned that something may be amiss with the elementals, he has committed the details of his sightings to parchment, and bids you deliver the document to Miounne.</target>

The frequency, however, does not bother me near so much as &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;where&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; they choose to fly─the patch of sky directly above the Guardian Tree.</target>

Yet the birdmen have been coming and going as they please, with nary a sign of protest from the guardians of the Twelveswood.</target>

Ever since the appearance of the much-talked-about “suspicious individual,” many and more strange things have been occurring in the forest. Could it be that he did something to the elementals?</target>
