The two tell a harrowing tale, of how close they came to death within the Wanderer's Palace themselves, only to be saved by the tonberries. Their respite was short-lived, however, as a bloodthirsty band of Mamool Ja sellswords invaded not long after, slaughtering many tonberries and locking the remainder away. The treasure-hunting duo barely escaped the attack with their lives. Now, they ask that you give the mercenaries the boot, and so aid their tonberry comrades. Speak with the ferryman Abazi Charazi to gain entrance to the Wanderer's Palace.</target>
