I had a feeling you would be the one Ahtbyrm sent. Since you first arrived at the Moraby Drydocks, I have had my men watch you. Oh, there's no need to get angry. I make it a point to keep an eye on all those new to the area.

I assume Ahtbyrm informed you of what your task would entail. The pirates we believe are conspiring to raid the Drydocks were last seen making camp near an ancient stone called the mark of the Spinner. I would have you approach the men, posing as a lost adventurer, and see if you cannot somehow learn of their intentions. C'nangho stationed at the rear gates can provide you with an exact location of the camp.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="54" approved="yes"><source>54</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_CNANGHO_000_20&lt;tab&gt;&lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;! Ha ha! I knew it! No more sardines for C'nangho. Tonight, I shall dine on the finest salmon on the peninsula! Why?

If you follow the road past the gates to the southeast, you will eventually come to a barren cape with a single large stone half-buried in the cliff overlooking the sea. Followers of the Twelve say it's a holy place dedicated to Nymeia, the Spinner. I'd be surprised if the pirates camped up there were aware of that, though.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="56" approved="yes"><source>56</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_CORSAIR_000_30&lt;tab&gt;I'm givin' ye to the count of nine to step back on that path, and carry yer 'venturin' arse back down to whatever rock it is ye crawled out from under.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="57" approved="yes"><source>57</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_CORSAIR_000_31&lt;tab&gt;Ye see, I's 'ad it up to me ears with yer type, roamin' the 'ills like they was yers to roam.
