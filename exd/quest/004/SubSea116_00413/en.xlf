        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBSEA116_00413_GHIMTHOTA_000_12&lt;tab&gt;Very well, then. I assume Ahtbyrm informed you of what your task would entail. The pirates we believe are conspiring to raid the Drydocks were last seen making camp near an ancient stone called the mark of the Spinner. I would have you approach the men, posing as a lost adventurer, and see if you cannot somehow learn of their intentions. C'nangho stationed at the rear gates can provide you with an exact location of the camp.</target>

If you follow the road past the gates to the southeast, you will eventually come to a barren cape with a single large stone half-buried in the cliff overlooking the sea. Followers of the Twelve say it's a holy place dedicated to Nymeia, the Spinner. I'd be surprised if the pirates camped up there were aware of that, though.</target>
