"","TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_SEQ_01<tab>Rammbroes and G'raha have been hard at work finding a way to rescue Unei, Doga, and Nero from the World of Darkness. However, their research has revealed a more pressing problem: Emperor Xande's covenant with the voidsent known as the Cloud of Darkness remains in effect, and his orders still control the Crystal Tower. Thus, the Allagan structure continues amassing energy to open a voidgate, and unleash the Cloud upon Eorzea. Should this come to pass, all that is will be destroyed. However, even amidst such dire circumstance, there is a sliver of hope. If NOAH can retrieve Unei and Doga from the dark realm, then the tower can be halted and the covenant broken. Garlond Ironworks has labored to make a machine able to open a small rift, through which a brave band of adventurers can enter the World of Darkness. Cid arrives to inform you the preparations are nearly complete, and bids you speak with Wedge at the Eight Sentinels.","TEXT_GAIUSD601_00494_SEQ_01<tab>前回までの冒険録：
調査団「ノア」は、クリスタルタワーの中枢である「シルクスの塔」の調査に乗り出した。開かずの扉に悪戦苦闘する最中、ウネとドーガを名乗る男女がノアに合流する。彼らの正体は、アラグ帝国に作られた皇族の複製品……「クローン」だった。ウネとドーガは、シルクスの塔の扉を開く代わりに、塔とともに目覚めたアラグ始皇帝「ザンデ」の討伐を依頼。冒険者の働きによって、蘇りし始皇帝の野望は潰えたかのように思えた。しかし、ザンデと妖異「暗闇の雲」が交わした契約を破棄しようと試みた瞬間、突如ヴォイドゲートが開き、ウネとドーガ、そして調査に加わっていたネロが「闇の世界」へと拐われてしまった。どうにか3人を救出したいと、道を模索するノア。一方で、アラグ皇族の特徴だという「紅血の魔眼」を宿すグ・ラハ・ティアにも、小さな異変が起きているのだった……。
