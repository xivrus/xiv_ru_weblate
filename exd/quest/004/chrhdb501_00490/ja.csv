I daresay, that spell of physical exertion at the Coliseum served well to clear my mind. My inquisitive senses feel even more heightened than ever! Most auspicious timing, as it would seem the fiend I pursue has set his sights on his greatest prize yet, an act which I am bound by duty and honor to foil. The exact nature of this final Belah'dian relic eludes me for the moment, but for Hildibrand─agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire─inspiration is always but a stone's throw away!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
The news Ellie shares with you is chilling indeed. Three prominent citizens of the sultanate have been murdered in cold blood, and evidence at the scene suggests that the thief of many faces is responsible. Meanwhile, the exact nature of the fourth and final relic that the thief is targeting remains unknown. At a loss for leads, Ellie proposes a visit to the sultanate's leading information-monger. Seek out Wymond on the Steps of Nald.","TEXT_CHRHDB501_00490_SEQ_01<tab>前回までの冒険録：
