        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBSEA118_00415_FYRILSMYD_000_11&lt;tab&gt;Two nights past, I made the trip from the Drydocks to Candlekeep Quay, just as the foreman asked. The seas were right rough, and the cap'n of the cargo ship was wary of bringin' her too close to the cliffs, so I paid a few coins to a fisher to take me out to meet her.</target>

Try as we might to steady the boat, nature's grip was too tight, and we was flung headlong into the Lominsan galley.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBSEA118_00415_AHTBYRM_000_21&lt;tab&gt;You see, there was no storm that day, and the seas here adjacent the Drydocks were as calm as a slumbering child. This leads me to believe that the trouble the ships encountered off Candlekeep Quay was of a less natural sort─the sort which the Sahagin have been known to conjure.</target>

But lo, the Navigator wouldn't see me to the gates of the seven hells, and I woke to find meself washed ashore. And here I's been, ever since, waitin' for a chance to salvage me master's cargo.</target>
