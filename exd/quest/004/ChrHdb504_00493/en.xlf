She further tells of her quest for vengeance against Ul'dah for the heinous crime of turning her ancestors into zombies─a historical fact covered up, she insists, by Phillice and her fellow Arbiters. Seeking to deliver revenge by her own hand, Cecy casts a handful of zombie powder at Phillice, only to see the ever-chivalrous Hildibrand take the brunt of the attack in her stead. As all look on with shock and dismay, Hildibrand's mother, Julyan, arrives on the scene. Distressed at the sight of her beloved son in his zombified state, she delivers a violent reckoning to her husband Godbert, whom she holds responsible for Hildibrand's plight, and Gilgamesh, who really just picked a bad time to show up. Fortunately, she takes an instant liking to you, and enlists your aid in saving her son from permanently joining the ranks of the undead.

That said, the cleansing agent must be administered before the ichor has diffused throughout the entire body.
