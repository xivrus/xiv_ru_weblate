Trna is informing you that would-be workers have gathered in hopes of hippo-based employment when Ogul arrives before you in a state of distress─and odd dress. She claims that a Gajasura calling himself “Acala” has injured a Rider and stolen a hippo cart, so Trna asks both you and Ogul to accompany her to the Shroud of the Samgha in hopes of evening the score with this hippo-stealing bandit.
