To begin, he asks that you bring a handful of seeds to the carrot creation station nearby.

After a brief explanation of what music is, he hums a melody together with his companion Knockingway. Both find it to be a heartwarming experience, and thus is Dreamingway inspired to share the gift of music with anyone and everyone─a dream of his very own.</target>
