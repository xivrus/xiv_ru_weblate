        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZD101_04502_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Galla of the Ist Legion has recently made her way to Camp Broken Glass with the refugees, though she was hoping that a young, red-haired boy was among their number. Prior to Galla's departure, he was refusing to leave Tertium, and she believes the child is most likely still there. She petitions your aid in persuading the boy to join his countrymen at your camp, that he may benefit from the food and warmth on offer.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

Although he is probably rather reluctant to cooperate, his distinctive scarlet locks should at least make him easy to locate.</target>
