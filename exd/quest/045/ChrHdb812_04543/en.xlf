I am myself again! Or am I? While I have come to realize the Forgiven Gentleman was no more than a figment of my imagination, the fact remains that my burly body and saintly soul have been separated from one another. I am trapped in this world of dazzling purple known as the First, unable to reunite with my physical form. But I have not yet begun to investigate─a solution will surely present itself in due course. You may rest assured, my good friends and beloved family, that Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville will not rest until he has been made whole!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
Looking none the worse for wear despite taking an exploding projectile to the face, a moderately lucid Hildibrand declares his desire to return home to the Source. Though he appears to only tenuously grasp the process you explain this would entail, he is eager to forge ahead, heedless of any potential risks. Said process will require the assistance of Beq Lugg, who Theyler and Vonard assure you will be most happy to help. Course of action decided, you and your companions begin the trek back to the Crystarium and the Cabinet of Curiosity.</target>

In spite of this faux pas, Beq Lugg grudgingly agrees to help. Hildibrand's soul proves to be sufficiently resolute, and in short order you find yourself in possession of a spirit vessel bearing his memories and vital essence. After offering thanks and farewells, you prepare for a return journey to the Source.</target>

Moments later, he is joined by Doctor Lugae, an amalgamation of flesh and metal that you vaguely recall besting in the Tower of Babil. The doctor, who specializes in the creation of artificial life-forms, seeks the perfect physical specimen for use in his experiments─Hildibrand, apparently.

You and Nashu rush to your comrade's defense, prompting Lugae to attempt to flee with his prize, but a skillful toss of the spirit vessel serves to awaken the inspector. After an impressive display of agility, Hildibrand somehow finds himself atop Lugae's head, and subsequently triggers one of the doctor's shoulder-mounted missiles to launch. Straddling the projectile, the inspector is propelled beyond the heavens and briefly into the void beyond, before he begins his rapid descent. In a fit of desperation, Hildibrand mashes buttons on the missile itself, redirecting its course at the last instant into the fleeing Lugae's face.

When the ashes have settled, Lugae's head and Jubraca are taken into custody by the local authorities, while the miraculously not-dead Hildibrand dusts himself off and poses proudly atop the sands. His moment of triumph is short-lived, however, as a curious flying vessel not unlike the ones described by Delion descends from the heavens and entraps him with a beam of light before flying off to gods know where...</target>
