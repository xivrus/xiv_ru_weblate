To your disappointment, the resulting crystal does not grant you a vision, but you take heart from your victory over one of Golbez's champions. Having fulfilled her part of the bargain, Zero demands the aether she is owed...only to collapse from exhaustion before she can receive it. Eager though Varshahn is to continue your mission, he bids you suspend it in favor of tending to your ailing companion, and you begin by carrying her back to her domain.</target>
