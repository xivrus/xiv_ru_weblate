Omega concludes that Sir's illogical actions strongly indicate the presence of a “heart,” which it has now defined as “a phenomenon which influences one's interpretation of reality.”

Upon arriving at the vessel, Biggs presses Omega to hold up its part of the bargain, and it finally provides you with a translation of the mystery transmission. It is a simple message, of hope and shared joy, the spiritual value of which appears lost on the ever-practical Omicron.</target>
