He proudly identifies himself as the selfsame youth you met once upon a time in Kugane...who happens to have an unhealthy obsession with Nashu Mhakaracca. It seems the apple of his eye has once again found herself in a pickle, and is greatly distressed by the condition of one Hildibrand─agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire. Curious as to what fate has befallen the redoubtable gentleman─you make for the High Crucible to learn more.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB811_04542_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Following events in the Far East in which Nashu and Hildibrand were sucked into a foreboding portal─along with Gilgamesh, notorious weapon thief, and Jubraca, an unscrupulous Hannish merchant─your associates found themselves wandering the “Interspectorial Rift” for a time. Eventually, with the aid of a recovered Gilgamesh, the other three managed to return to the Source. However, while Nashu was none the worse for wear, Hildibrand emerged in a comatose state for reasons yet unknown. The inspector's plucky assistant has attempted to fashion medicines to revive him, but to no avail. Hoping you might have some insight into his condition, she invites you to join her in Kama at the residence where the inspector is convalescing.</target>

Nashu, understandably, is not quite able to grasp the situation, but she is nevertheless heartened that you might be able to bring him back. Entrusting you with her homemade explosives should you have need of them, she bids you a safe journey, and you prepare to depart for the Crystarium. With luck, you will track down the gentleman inspector's wandering spirit.</target>

After listening to the account of said bounty hunter, the dwarf Giott, you are all but convinced that the man in question is none other than Inspector Hildibrand. You are subsequently approached by the former guardsmen Theyler and Vonard, who coincidentally enough are also on the trail of the infamous poser. United by a common goal, you and your comrades depart for Sullen, where the man was last spotted.</target>

Fortunately, a judicious application of Nashu's Delight is enough to make the inspector remember who he is. In that instant, you and your companions are granted a vision by the Echo, which reveals in ludicrous detail how a chance encounter with Giott led Hildibrand to believe he was a Lightwarden extraordinaire. In any event, having been disabused of such notions, Hildibrand strikes his trademark pose and announces his triumphant return to his adoring fans.</target>
