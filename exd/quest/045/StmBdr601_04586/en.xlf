Sure enough, you are soon joined by the inimitable Biggs and Wedge, who themselves are accompanied by Alpha and the scale model of Omega. After exchanging surprised greetings, Biggs shares his suspicion that, in its final moments, the original Omega may have somehow transferred its mind into its toylike counterpart. The contraption's newly added voice module removes all doubt, allowing the entity to confirm its identity, not to mention its ability to understand the transmitted missive. Omega's willingness to cooperate, however, is contingent upon you assisting with its investigation into certain anomalies surrounding the Final Days...</target>
