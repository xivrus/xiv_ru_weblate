However, Deryk's blithe mentioning of your recent activities begins to attract the attention of the pious folk nearby, and upon being alerted to their dismay, he sheepishly takes himself outside.</target>

Before you can offer something, however, G'raha Tia arrives on the scene. After his initial shock at your presence, he turns his attention to the woman, one Snoegeim, who promptly springs back to life thanks to his gift of nutritious provender. Introduced as the mythologist Krile recruited, Snoegeim can barely contain her excitement as she hears your account of the phantom realm, and identifies similarities between the domains you visited and the heavens of legend. Having thus successfully rendezvoused with your new colleague, you make your way to join Krile in the Omphalos.</target>

Afterwards, your group disperses for a time, with the solitary explorer opting to go for a walk nearby. For want of an immediate task of your own, you decide to look in on him.</target>
