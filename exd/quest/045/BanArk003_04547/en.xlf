				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANARK003_04547_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Hippo Riders' food delivery service is an instant success, which is phenomenal for their coffers, but hard on their hippos. Trna is expressing her concern over her hippos' health when she is interrupted by her frantic associate Ghasa, who was accosted by an armor-clad bandit and robbed of the meals he was delivering. After sending Ghasa out to redeliver the order, Trna asks you to accompany her to the Shroud of the Samgha in search of this mysterious food thief.

Anticipating the possibility of being accosted once more ere the case of the would-be hippo-napper can be solved, Maru and Ghasa team up to install comfortable stables and a modest wading pool in Svarna. The mysterious bandit may still be at large, but the Riders' hardworking hippos will now be well rested, relaxed, and ready to take on whatever challenges await them!</target>
