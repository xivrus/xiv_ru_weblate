Yet even as you struggle to decide whether the mysterious beings gave rise to their respective faiths or were born of them, Rhalgr and Byregot appear before you once more, in the form of a hawk and a spriggan respectively.

Having shared this detail in lieu of an apology for their earlier deception, the pair then take their leave. As you discuss these revelations, Krile contacts you with word that she has recruited an acquaintance to your cause─an authority on mythology.
