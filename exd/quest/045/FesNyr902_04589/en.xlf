Before you can say a word, however, he asks for a moment of your time, nodding in Beaudefoin's direction. His desire to lift the adventurer's spirits is quickly apparent, and though he makes a valiant effort to do so, the despondent man can no longer see reason. Convinced that his words cannot reach the down-on-his-luck adventurer, the omikujishi instead turns to you, asking that you too make an attempt to cheer the poor man up.

And yet, upon reading it, Beaudefoin somehow manages to sink even further into the depths of despair. The omikujishi, having at last lost patience, reads the remainder of the fortune himself. The fortune's final words of guidance, and a well-placed remark from yourself are what finally release Beaudefoin from the clutches of his own fear. But no sooner has he been made to see reason than the mochi daikan appears before you out of breath, bringing distressing news of an adventurer in trouble. Believing this adventurer to be Hildelana, Beaudefoin rushes off to the rescue. Concerned whether Beaudefoin is in the right state of mind to be saving anyone, the omikujishi asks that you follow after him, to which you oblige.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR902_04589_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Though you find Hildelana and Beaudefoin free from any serious harm, the same cannot be said for Beaudefoin's beloved armor.

Having heard that naught can be done for Beaudefoin's armor, and moved by his selfless act, the usagi bugyo insists that the adventurer accept a set of yoroi from the Far Eastern delegation. The omikujishi reminds the flabbergasted man, still unable to believe his luck, that omikuji should be seen as a guide, and not as one's fate set in stone. With a new set of armor in tow, Beaudefoin and Hildelana are ready to set off on a new adventure, their bond of friendship tempered by the day's events. Turning to you, the omikujishi thanks you for your service, offering you a set of yoroi of your own, and the opportunity to draw as many omikuji as you wish. With your obligations thus fulfilled, you are free to enjoy the remainder of the festivities to your heart's content.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR902_04589_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;/rally Beaudefoin's spirits.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR902_04589_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;/psych Beaudefoin up.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR902_04589_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Search for Beaudefoin in lower La Noscea.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="27" approved="yes"><source>27</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR902_04589_TODO_03&lt;tab&gt;Speak with the Far Eastern omikujishi in Limsa Lominsa.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR902_04589_HILDELANA_000_104&lt;tab&gt;Goodness, I can't believe I'd never heard of omikuji before this!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR902_04589_BEAUDEFOIN_000_105&lt;tab&gt;Ugh, what am I supposed to do now...?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="50" approved="yes"><source>50</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR902_04589_OMIKUJISHI_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Forgive me, my friend, but might I ask for another moment of your time?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR902_04589_OMIKUJISHI_000_002&lt;tab&gt;In no small part due to your assistance, many are enjoying their first experience with omikuji.
