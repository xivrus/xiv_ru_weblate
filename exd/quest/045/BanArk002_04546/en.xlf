        <target state="final">TEXT_BANARK002_04546_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Trna is energetic with news of the Hippo Riders' progress, but Maru, one of her associates, voices an uneasy prediction: due to the hippo carts' limited storage capacity, it will be only a matter of time before bigger competition sweeps them out of business. Not to be deterred, Trna starts considering what niche service the Hippo Riders might offer, but arrives at no clear answer. You agree to meet her at the Great Work in the hopes that her clientele may offer more inspiration.
