To wit, she would ask you to make haste to the Greatloam Growery and do what you can to procure eggs from Master Pawlin's flock of fine chickens─a task which has proved an unexpected challenge thus far. You set out for the farm in hopes of seeking out one Nonotta─a friend of Jihli's who will provide further enlightenment as to the task required of you.
