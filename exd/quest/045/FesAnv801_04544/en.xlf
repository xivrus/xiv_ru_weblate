The man reveals that, in seeking inspiration for his next composition, he contrived to bring you and Nhagi'a together─an adventurer old and an adventurer new─in a reminder that the present owes its existence to the past. Having thus established his vision, the minstrel then asks each of you to bring him an object with a connection to the Calamity, the event which gave rise to the realm's rebirth. Excited for his first-ever task as an adventurer, Nhagi'a suggests taking your search to the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, where many vendors peddle their wares.</target>

The lad reveals his object to be the scrapbook of articles taken from &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;The Raven&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, the Gridanian tabloid where his sister works as a reporter. During the Calamity, said sister traveled the realm, interviewing adventurers about their journeys, and her tales instilled in him the desire to see the world. Your combined contributions serve to inspire the minstrel, who conceives of a verse and proceeds to perform it. No sooner does he strum the first chord than you are transported to a place beyond time and space, where you meet with the mysterious Naoki Yoshida. The man thanks you for continuing to grace the realm with your presence, and hints that change is coming. Yet come what may, he hopes that your journey together shall ever continue.

Returning to reality, you bid Nhagi'a well as he sets off on his own. And after the young adventurer has disappeared from sight, the minstrel performs for you another song─one of futures unknown and journeys unending. Hardships may await upon the road ahead, and there may be times when you feel defeated. But so long as you harbor love for this world, ever shall there be a place for you in it.</target>
