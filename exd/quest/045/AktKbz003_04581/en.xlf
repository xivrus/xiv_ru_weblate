To that end, he bids you accompany him to speak with captives of the IIIrd Legion held in custody at Camp Broken Glass. </target>

She tells you of Nerva's last whereabouts, but before you have time to ponder her words, Kan-E-Senna arrives. She is all but certain the barrier protecting the Tower of Babil is fueled by ambient aether being drawn towards the tower. To be certain, she intends to examine the area's aetheric currents with her own eyes, and invites you to accompany her.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Kan-E-Senna casts out her senses, and after a few moments, her suspicions are confirmed─the area's ambient aether is indeed being drawn toward the tower. Her assessment of the situation is soon interrupted, however, by the appearance of Nero. Being in a magnanimous mood, he tells you what he learned in the Tower of Babil─namely, that Varis's heart is being used to gather aether to power the shield protecting the tower. Vergilia, having vague recollections of her time enthralled to Anima, believes she knows where to find it. Knowing where to begin your search, Lorens suggests splitting into two groups─a small unit to breach the facility holding Varis's heart, and another together with your main force to breach the Tower of Babil once its defenses are down.

No sooner does Lorens take his leave with Yugiri, Fordola, and Vergilia than Fourchenault receives an emergency message via linkpearl. A number of refugees have left Camp Broken Glass, heading in the direction of the Tower of Babil.</target>

They balk at the proposition, but much to your surprise, Nero proves the catalyst to kindle their interest. Thus inspired to pursue this new endeavor, they return to the camp, leaving you to prepare for your confrontation with the blasphemy Nerva.</target>
