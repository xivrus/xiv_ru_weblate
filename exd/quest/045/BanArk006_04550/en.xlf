        <target state="final">TEXT_BANARK006_04550_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Trna tells you that Acala and his crew are settling in well, despite some personal challenges. Indeed, she seems more worried about the impending arrival of Kancana, who is on her way to Svarna for an important conversation. After everything you've been through together, Trna would really appreciate your moral support.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANARK006_04550_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Kancana arrives with Ogul for the dreaded conversation, which turns out to be nothing more than a glowing endorsement of Trna's efforts. Not only has she proven herself as a reliable business partner, Kancana says, but she has managed to do what most thought nigh impossible: rebuild a burnt bridge between the Arkasodara and Gajasura peoples. In a show of her unwavering faith, Kancana gifts Trna the deed to Svarna, allowing the Hippo Riders full autonomy over their land and business. The look of stunned disbelief welling in Trna's eyes reminds you of how much she has overcome to get here.</target>

But in the next moment, the illusion dissipates, leaving only this young entrepreneur filled with energy, inspiration, and hope for Thavnair's bright tomorrow waiting just on the horizon.</target>
