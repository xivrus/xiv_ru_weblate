It is said that this famous satrap not only forged an alliance with a dragon, but also returned from a journey to another world with fabulous riches in his possession. The most widely known and enduring tale, however, concerns Alzadaal's Legacy, a treasure vault he constructed deep beneath the waves, the entrance to which is supposedly hidden on an island in the middle of the Bounty. Jalheen indicates that more information regarding this isle and how it may be reached can be obtained from his friend, Azahma.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMH102_04527_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;You locate Azahma, who recounts the tale of his missing friend and the information he purchased from a merchant in the bazaar.

Such a coincidence can only be fate─though the authenticity of the map in question is far less certain, given the elaborate performance by what was clearly the peddler's young accomplice.
