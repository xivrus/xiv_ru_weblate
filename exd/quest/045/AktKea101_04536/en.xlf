The conversation then turns to business, with Rammbroes informing you that an explorer recently appeared who claimed to have discovered the phantom realm, an enigmatic place that has long persisted in Eorzean legend. Wishing to see the realm with your own eyes, you and G'raha Tia go to find the explorer in question, one Deryk, who should be somewhere near the banks of Silvertear Lake.</target>

It turns out, however, that the creature is associated with the man, as it promptly clambers on his shoulder when he appears with G'raha Tia. Having been introduced, Deryk offers to show you to the phantom realm's entrance, and you watch in awe as he takes one step, and then another, onto the shimmering water of Silvertear Lake. Keeping your amazement in check for a moment, you follow him across the lake and into the unknown.</target>

The explorer hopes that you will be able to shed light upon this place, and to that end you and G'raha Tia split up to explore.</target>
