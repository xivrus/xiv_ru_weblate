				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANARK005_04549_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Trna relates that the new meyhane is a hit with the locals, putting so many adventuring types at her disposal that she now receives direct requests from the Radiant Host itself. Perhaps predictably, Ghasa interrupts this good news with reports of a gaggle of Gajasura heading straight for Svarna, so she asks you to extend an adventurer's welcome to Acala's cohorts. While she doesn't yet explain her reasons, Trna leaves you with one, immovable condition: whatever fighting occurs must not end in tragedy.

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANARK005_04549_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;When you arrive, Ogul has her weapon drawn and tensions are running high. Acala demands that the Hippo Riders forfeit Svarna and leave immediately. Trna retorts that Acala and his people should join the Riders instead of fighting them. Unable to reconcile their differences, Trna finally starts speaking Acala's language when she challenges him, leader to leader, to a race on hippo carts across a predetermined stretch of the island. Acala, confident in his abilities, accepts and heads directly to the starting line at Yedlihmad.</target>

Citizens from across Thavnair are invited to witness the landmark competition between the Arkasodara and Gajasura, the first of its kind on the island─or, perhaps, anywhere. Bolstered by your reassurance, Trna bids you accompany her as she negotiates terms of engagement with Acala.</target>
