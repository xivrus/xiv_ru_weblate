        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMH101_04526_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Having traveled to the edge of existence and back, the question of what comes next has been at the forefront of your mind. Tataru inquires into your plans for the future, and her suggestion of returning to your adventuring roots strikes a chord. In particular, you recall the words of Emet-Selch, urging you to see with your own eyes the Bounty's undersea ruins...

Having anticipated your rekindled passion for exploration, Tataru reveals that she is in the process of crafting you a new set of traveling clothes. You try to wait patiently as she cuts and sews, but are soon overcome by the accumulated fatigue of saving a world and slip into an unexpected nap. You awake to find an apologetic Tataru, who asks that you accompany her to the Diamond Forge where she intends to add the finishing touches to your outfit.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMH101_04526_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Promising a shorter wait than before, Tataru throws herself body and soul into completing her work. You express admiration for the finished product, but in lieu of praise and payment she asks that you wear the outfit where other adventurers might see it, and thus garner interest for Tataru Taru's Boutique. It seems that even your return to adventure is an opportunity to drum up business!</target>
