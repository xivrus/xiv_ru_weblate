You board without further delay and depart for the vault, Y'shtola's quiet focus offset somewhat by Nidhana's infectious enthusiasm.

The Archon then embeds the talisman within one of the diminutive familiars before sending both through the gate into the void. For your part, you are charged with standing guard while the experiment is in progress, lest hostile entities attempt to slip through the open portal.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMH109_04534_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Judging the experiment has gone on long enough, Y'shtola recalls her nixies from the shadowy realm beyond. The results are plain─while the warded familiar appears unaffected, its unprotected comrade has already begun to transform into a creature of the void. Y'shtola notes that, although G'raha Tia's hypothesis appears to be correct, the talisman will require augmentation to withstand the relentless influence of the Thirteenth.

A question from Estinien prompts a brief lecture on the nature of the void, a world plunged into an eternal darkness when the Ascians failed catastrophically in their efforts to force a Rejoining. You add to the explanation, sharing your own memories of the Thirteenth and the aether-starved monstrosities which stalk its sunless expanse. Varshahn considers these horrors good reason to discourage your expedition, but something in his demeanor suggests he feels otherwise in his heart of hearts...</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMH109_04534_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with the veteran Radiant.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMH109_04534_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Nidhana.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMH109_04534_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Stand guard at the designated location.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMH109_04534_VARSHAHN_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Archon Y'shtola requested that I join you, but of her plans she offered scant detail...</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMH109_04534_ESTINIEN_000_005&lt;tab&gt;The boy Mehrahd was glad to hear the news of the foundation.
