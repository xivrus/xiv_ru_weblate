Ollier would have you inquire with the poor man as an impartial third party, and begs that you accompany him to Limsa Lominsa, where the individual in question is currently on assignment.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
