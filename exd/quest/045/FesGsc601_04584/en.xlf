Ollier would have you inquire with the poor man as an impartial third party, and begs that you accompany him to Limsa Lominsa, where the individual in question is currently on assignment.

Whatever could be responsible for his uncharacteristic lack of motivation? All you can do is speak to the succulent staff member and inquire for yourself.</target>
