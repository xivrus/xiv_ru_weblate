				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;Witnesses to the transformation noted that the man affected was listening to a radio which continues to play a strange, cryptic message. As you consider who could be sending this broadcast, you are soon joined by Aymeric, Merlwyb, Artoirel, and the Gridanian sentry. You listen to the radio together once more, and part of its message strikes a chord with the sentry─he recalls it being the mantra of Nerva yae Galvus of the IIIrd Legion. With this newfound information, Fourchenault is now convinced that Nerva is the blasphemy they are searching for.

Before long, the group's attention turns to the more immediate concern of the Garlean refugees. Though reluctant at first, they are soon convinced to discuss forming an interim governing body, as well as the possibility of rebuilding Garlemald or immigrating to Sharlayan. The Grand Company leaders have much to think about, affording you the opportunity to rest until there is new word of the blasphemy.</target>
