Despite the imminent possibility of travel to the void, however, Vrtra remains hesitant about resuming the search for his sister. Strong words of encouragement from Nahbdeen and the assembled Hannish crowd nearly convince him to reach a decision, but it is your contribution which finally moves the great wyrm to “take heart.” Thus bolstered in spirit, Vrtra announces he will trust Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han to his people for a time, and attempt what he has dreamed of for five thousand long years.</target>
