Furthermore, the fact that the girl has not succumbed to the blood suggests that it was passed on to her by her parents. Forced to accept the truth at last, Sidurgu despairs that the Temple Knights will never cease their pursuit of Rielle. He bemoans his inability to harness the abyss his master spoke of, which piques the dying dragon's curiosity. After learning the nature of your dark arts, the dragon chides you for your foolishness, stating that even the tiny beings who frolic in the mists of Sohm Al know a better way. Sidurgu presses her for details, but the dragon's energy is spent. No more answers will be had.

Introducing herself as Ystride de Caulignont, she offers you a choice: trial by combat, or death for you and all who dare aid you. Seeing no alternative, Sidurgu grudgingly agrees. As Ystride turns to leave, Rielle at last cries out, revealing that she is Ystride's daughter. Incensed by her daughter's words, Ystride storms out of the tavern, and Sidurgu whirls about to confront Rielle. He demands to know why she never told him, shouting that he and Fray had a right to know─reminding her they bled for her, that Fray died for her. Shaken, she struggles to explain, but Sidurgu has heard enough. Refusing to look at Rielle, he bids you leave them for now, that he might have time to think.
