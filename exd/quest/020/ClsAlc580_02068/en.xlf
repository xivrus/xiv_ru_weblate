A single Lalafellin fellow was driving a carriage, and in the back were two barrels─of which the suspect claims no prior knowledge. Within these were two identical Hyuran men, one alive and one dead. The living one is silent, presumably in the same state as the Near Eastern youth you found earlier. Chanene is at wit's end but for a single lead: a cracked leather journal found on the dead man. In it, he speaks of a sister working in Tailfeather. Venture there now, and find out if the corpse had a twin.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSALC580_02068_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The dead man's sister informs you somewhat coldly that her brother─a brute by all report─had neither a twin nor identical friends.

The culprit himself, however, denies this, saying he could not possibly perform such feats of strength. Neither Wiltwaek nor Chanene believe him innocent, and so ask that you brew a high-quality draconian potion of strength. Do so, that Chanene may drink it and test if a Lalafell aided by alchemy can lift so great a weight.

With his alibi disproved, the suspect tells you everything─how an aging alchemist hired him to move the bodies, and how the twin is in fact a “clone,” a living, breathing copy of the original. This mastermind has been stealing people from their beds to practice this process, apparently born of ancient Allag's ingenuity. The culprit also tells you that this man has no problem whatsoever with killing, and begs Wiltwaek for protection. With these new facts at your feet, Wiltwaek states with furrowed brow that you must capture this mastermind soon, or there will be further bloodshed.
