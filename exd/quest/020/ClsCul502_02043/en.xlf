If the prospect of a new challenge piques your interest, head over to the Missing Member and present yourself to the head waitress, one Melkoko.</target>

The winner of the previous edition, she reveals, is none other than the Missing Member's head chef, a man named H'mhasi Tia, of whom she is none too fond. She bids you speak with the fellow inside the tavern, that you might understand her aversion towards him.</target>

Whether or not you share her enthusiasm for poetic justice, you are bound to gain something by pitting your skills against other culinarians.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Melkoko upon reaching level 53.</target>
