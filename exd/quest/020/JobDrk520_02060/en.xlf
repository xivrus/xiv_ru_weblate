        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBDRK520_02060_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;On his deathbed, Sidurgu's master spoke of a “flame in the abyss,” a concept which Sidurgu and Fray did not understand. In following the creed of their predecessors, they hoped that the meaning would become clear to them in time. Alas, when they intervened to save the life of a young girl, they were marked for death by the order. Fray was captured and executed in a trial by combat, leaving Sidurgu to care for Rielle by himself. Fearing that he cannot handle the task alone, he implores you to join his cause, and you agree. Perhaps now would be a good time to get to know Rielle.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBDRK520_02060_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Though somewhat standoffish, Rielle responds to your inquiries as best she can. Satisfied that you have established a rudimentary rapport, Sidurgu interrupts with his latest plan. Since the Temple Knights appear to be convinced that Rielle is some sort of abomination, Sidurgu would first determine if there is anything unusual about her. To that end, he proposes that you seek out a Vanu healer in the Sea of Clouds, as some are said to possess the ability to see their patients' aether. Rendezvous with him in Camp Cloudtop.</target>

Sidurgu asks that you seek out and slay gastornis for their feathers, as it is said the Vanu use them in their rituals.</target>

A great spirit dwells within her, the healer begins─but before she can finish, she senses others following in your wake and flees.
