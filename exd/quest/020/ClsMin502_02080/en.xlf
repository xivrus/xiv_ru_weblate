This youngest member of the company clues you in on a tradition of sorts, and gives you the nickname “Professor.” Haimirich bids you wait for the present, as there is no work to be had. However, he asks that you make yourself ready for when it comes.

※The next miner quest will be available from Haimirich upon reaching level 53.</target>
