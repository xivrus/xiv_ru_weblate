He recalls the words of a great goldsmith─“To give form to that which is formless, and breathe a warm, beating heart into the coldest of metal”─and suggests that you use them as a starting point in your search for inspiration. Seek out Serendipity at the Goldsmiths' Guild and Momodi at the Quicksand and see if they have any insight into the matter.</target>
