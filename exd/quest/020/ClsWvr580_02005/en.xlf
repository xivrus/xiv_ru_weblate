Glenda may suspect something is up, however, for she has recently demanded that Averil spin a wool donation. Averil has done so, and asks that you take it to her mother in Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral.</target>

Much as she would like you to make the monastic robes in her place, she understands that she must do it by herself. However, Averil continues, her mother never forbade you from making the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;materials&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; for the robes. To that end, she asks that you spin her three spindles of high-quality crawler silk.</target>

With a hint of devilish glee, Averil announces that she will be staying out longer and later, and Glenda walks off in a huff. Averil says she will continue practicing, and will call upon you one last time when the day of battle draws near.

※The next weaver quest will be available from Averil upon reaching level 60.</target>
