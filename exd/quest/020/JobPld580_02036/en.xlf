Upon learning that the men you seek are Ul'dahn, the Ishgardian is inspired to regale you with a tale of southron idiocy, namely a gang of Ul'dahns who managed to sneak aboard the airships which travel regularly to Camp Cloudtop. The Ul'dahns then attempted to seize the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Protector&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, despite the fact that the airship is not fit for travel. Suspecting this to be a serendipitous coincidence─and having no other leads whatsoever─Constaint suggests that you go and investigate the incident at Camp Cloudtop.</target>
