Ridiculous though it sounds, he is accused of besmirching Ishgardian honor by planting a foreign variety of gysahl greens on Ishgardian soil─an indiscretion which may well cost him his life. Unless you can provide conclusive proof of Basyle's innocence, he will be forced to defend it in a trial by combat. The desperate botanist begs you to go to the Botanists' Guild, whence the seeds for the offending vegetables hail, and ask Fufucha for advice.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSHRV600_02052_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Fufucha is shocked to learn of Basyle's situation. That shock soon gives way to pleasure, however, as she goes on to reveal that the gysahl greens in question are in fact of Coerthan stock, whereas most of the plants presently grown in Ishgard are of the Near Eastern variety. In order to prove this point, she gives you a bunch of Greatloam gysahl greens, and bids you gather three bunches of chysahl greens in the western highlands of Coerthas. Once you have obtained the latter, present both varieties of greens to the herbalist Martineau in Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral, that he might attest to their similarities.</target>
