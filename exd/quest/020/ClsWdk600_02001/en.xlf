Barthovieu has learned from this experience that his knowledge of the dragon is far from complete, and now wishes to examine one of its scales. He believes at least one may have fallen from the Dravanian inside the snare. Make your way now to the Convictory, and speak with one of the soldiers there to examine the now-burned trap.</target>

However, in so doing, he found a spearhead, and reasons that the weapon was buried within Nguruvilu's body. Insofar as this cannot be burned to provide warmth, he gives it to you. Return with it to Barthovieu in the Brume, and see if it has any significance.</target>

He realizes that his sire was not killed by beastkin, but rather died fighting Nguruvilu, as a knight. The lance remained in the dragon's body until it flew over the Black Shroud. The spearhead came loose but recently. Barthovieu exclaims he can now kill the dragon by driving a lance through the wound in Nguruvilu's scales. Philipallais is upset by this development and rushes off, but Barthovieu is not dissuaded. He bids you make him a spear able to finally put paid to the fiend─a high-quality adamantite trident.
