For this purpose, only titanium will serve. However, it is unclear where ore can be mined in sufficient quantity to fulfill the knights' needs. Haimirich turns to you for an answer, and, given that you do not seem to have one, bids you seek the counsel of your guildmaster. Armed with a sample of titanium, make your way to Ul'dah and see what Adalberta has to say.</target>

Though you came to speak with the latter, it is the former who tells you where to find the titanium. It seems that some years ago, Deep Canyon came across a similar sample of the metal in the hands of a hunter who made his living in the Dravanian forelands. Wide Gulley swears that the chunk of metal you brought is identical to the one the hunter had, and Adalberta theorizes that the ore must originate in the area. Return now to Haimirich at the Forgotten Knight with this piece of information.</target>

Though this is hardly definitive, Haimirich is willing to mobilize Oschon's Raiders on this hunch. Rendezvous with them in the Dravanian forelands.</target>
