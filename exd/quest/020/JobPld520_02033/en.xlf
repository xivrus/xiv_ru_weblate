				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBPLD520_02033_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;You arrive in time to rescue a young boy from a group of bandits curiously intent on ending his life. Afterwards, he explains that he was a friend of Solkzagyl's, and that the men who killed him are the same ones whom you just defeated: Death's Embrace, the assassins who stole Oathkeeper years ago at the behest of the Monetarists. As you watch the boy go, Papashan contacts you via linkpearl, and you inform him of Solkzagyl's death. Aghast and confused, he bids you go after the boy and see what else you can learn of Solkzagyl's final days.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBPLD520_02033_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;The boy introduces himself as Constaint, friend and former pupil of Solkzagyl. After the former captain saved him from a pack of ravenous wolves, Constaint begged the captain to teach him the ways of the paladin. For a time, Solkzagyl refused, but eventually he relented and accepted the boy as his student. However, he never shared his latest discoveries with Constaint, choosing instead to challenge Death's Embrace when the boy was absent. Though he lacks a master, Constaint is still resolved to become a paladin and reclaim Oathkeeper in Solkzagyl's stead. With your help, he may yet succeed.

※The next paladin quest will be available from Constaint upon reaching level 54.</target>
