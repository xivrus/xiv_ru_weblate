				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBAST500_02018_JANNEQUINARD_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Lady Leveva tells me that you are nearly ready to open the sixth and final gate. Yes. I said final. We all know there are seven heavens, but opening the seventh is impossible...well, except upon death, of course. An attempt to attune to the pole star would be sheer madness and most certainly spell your doom. Ah, but look at me. Even now, attempting to tutor the great &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;, when it is obvious your talent far surpasses mine. Forgive me.</target>

It is not as if I would make any untoward attempts at sullying her honor. Having seen but half the summers as I, she is far too young for my tastes.</target>
