All that remains is to prepare for the contest, and Melkoko immediately has a challenge to help you get into form. A diner is struggling to decide upon a dessert, and your task is to prepare something to suit her palate. Seek out the diner, a steerswoman of the Sanguine Sirens, and inquire after her preferences.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL530_02044_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Upon hearing your report, Melkoko swiftly concludes that the steerswoman simply has an aversion to the unfamiliar. As such, rather than abiding by the customer's wishes, she suggests that you make something that is unapologetically sweet. Prepare a Sohm Al tart and a cup of Ishgardian tea, and present them to Melkoko.</target>

To her astonishment and delight, she finds both to be delectable. Having thus conquered her fear of sweets, she leaves in high spirits, hopeful that things will work out between her and her beau. Having now seen you in action, Melkoko looks forward to the Dellemont d'Or with even greater relish.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Melkoko upon reaching level 55.</target>
