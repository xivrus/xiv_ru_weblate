While you are unsure as to why this falls to you, make your way up the Jeweled Crozier to Mistress Elaisse regardless.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CLSTAN530_02076_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Elde appreciates Elaisse's concern, but she disregards the warning. Now, she finally asks for your help with her plan. Since the climate changes in Coerthas, it appears that warm footwear is in great demand amongst Ishgard's commoners. Ortefauchel, who seems quite taken with Elde's shop, seconds this opinion. Subsequently, Elde asks that you fashion a pair of high-quality wyvernskin workboots─not to sell, but rather to use as a pattern for her own craftsmen.</target>

A passing fellow also takes a fancy to the footwear, going so far as to dub you a “Gridanian master.” Much encouraged, Elde prepares to put her plan into motion.

※The next leatherworker quest will be available from Elde upon reaching level 55.</target>
