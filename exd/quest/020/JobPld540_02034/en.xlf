The boy's mother was also a victim of Death's Embrace, murdered when her caravan was attacked on the road to Tailfeather. The former assassins had turned to banditry to survive, taking care to pick targets which would not provoke a response from the authorities. Yet even the least among us deserve a champion, Constaint believes. Though it may not lead him to Oathkeeper, he firmly believes that it is his duty as a paladin to stop Death's Embrace before they strike again.
