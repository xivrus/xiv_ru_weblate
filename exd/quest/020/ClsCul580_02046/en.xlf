With his hands full preparing for the visit, Lyngsath needs you to cook for an old friend in his stead. The friend, an elderly retired pirate, is fond of meat, but no longer has the teeth with which to masticate it. To this end, Lyngsath bids you prepare for him a dish that is at once meaty and tender─cockatrice meatballs.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL580_02046_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;No sooner do you present the cockatrice meatballs to Lyngsath than Master Dellemont arrives at the Bismarck. He waits patiently as the guildmaster serves his old friend, who devours his meal with relish and leaves with a smile on his face. Shortly thereafter, H'mhasi Tia and Melkoko come to pay their respects to Master Dellemont, but an argument breaks out between them which culminates in an unexpected wager. Though she has absolutely no business doing so, Melkoko agrees to relinquish ownership of the Bismarck to H'mhasi Tia should he emerge triumphant in the Dellemont d'Or. Should he lose to you, however, he must give up his calling. The stakes have become exceedingly high; see to it that you are fully prepared for the contest─for Lyngsath's sake, if no one else's.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Melkoko upon reaching level 60.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL580_02046_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Lyngsath.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL580_02046_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;&lt;var 08 E3E802E803 ((Synthesize a serving of cockatrice meatballs &lt;var 28 ((Addon)) 0A01 /var&gt;)) ((Deliver the cockatrice meatballs &lt;var 28 ((Addon)) 0A01 /var&gt; to Lyngsath)) /var&gt;.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL580_02046_MELKOKO_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Doubtless you're wondering what became of Captain Rhoswen's plot.
