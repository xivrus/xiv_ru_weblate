        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBDRK300_02053_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Justice has been done this day, as another trial by combat has concluded. According to one spectator, it was a fight for the ages, as the accused wielded a massive sword and worked his dark arts against his foe. In the end, however, he was no match for his opponent, who ran him through to a chorus of cheers. Seeing no need to afford the man a proper burial, the Temple Knights mean to dispose of the corpse by leaving it in the Brume. Intrigued by the spectator's account, you consider seeking out the knights and seeing this “demon” for yourself.</target>

You collapse, and when you open your eyes, you find the &lt;var 08 E905 ((woman)) ((man)) /var&gt; standing before you, hale and healthy. &lt;var 08 E905 ((She)) ((He)) /var&gt; calls &lt;var 08 E905 ((herself)) ((himself)) /var&gt; Fray, and it would seem that reports of &lt;var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var&gt; death were greatly exaggerated. &lt;var 08 E905 ((She)) ((He)) /var&gt; is intrigued when you tell &lt;var 08 E905 ((her)) ((him)) /var&gt; of the voice you heard, but before you can continue, a cry from the streets below draws your attention. You turn to leave, but Fray bars your path and insists that you discuss the “changes” you are undergoing due to touching &lt;var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var&gt; crystal.</target>
