Firstly, only the very best of alchemists can create a copy of &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Noble Gold&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. Secondly, each alchemist's aether has a unique color to it, which is transferred to any grimoires created through the enchanted ink inscribed within. While normally invisible to the naked eye, the guildmaster has invented a powder to render it visible─spectrolium. With this, you can prove that Waoud created the copy of &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Noble Gold&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, and that he is a master alchemist. Return now to Wiltwaek with the good news.</target>

With Chanene's help, he also effectively demonstrates that Waoud is indeed a master alchemist, and therefore the architect of these foul murders. However, even when accused point blank, Waoud is strangely silent. You look across the floor, and see the Near Eastern youth─whose eyes suddenly stare back at you. The clone makes a bolt for the door, and Chanene realizes that Waoud must have already transferred his soul into this once-empty vessel. Though Wiltwaek is slow on the uptake, he nevertheless charges and subdues the new Waoud. Speak with him now to wrap up this case once and for all.</target>
