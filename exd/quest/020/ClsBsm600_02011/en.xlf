She has proven herself in the eyes of many spectators, and become a crowd favorite. However, now that she will face the final eight challengers, he fears his mistress needs every advantage. He bids you forge a high-quality adamantite winglet, of the same size and shape as the original Integrity. Do so, that the steward might present a truly fearsome weapon to the baroness.
