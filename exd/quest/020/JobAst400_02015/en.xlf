And after I told him to keep his mouth shut! Though, I suppose I must bear some of the fault for ever thinking he could do as he was told.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBAST400_02015_LEVEVA_000_013&lt;tab&gt;So by shuffling a card back into the deck, we are in no way ignoring or denying a future, merely postponing a reading intended for a later date, and replacing it with something that better pertains to the present. I trust that you will pick up this technique swifter than Jannequinard.</target>
