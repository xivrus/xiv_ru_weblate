Barthovieu arrives just in time to stop his son from throwing the weapon away, and demands an explanation. The child tearfully begs his father to stop chasing the dragon. If Barthovieu really must continue, Philipallais asks, why not use a trap to snare Nguruvilu? This way, his father would be able to slay the dragon from relative safety, and attain knighthood as well. Touched by his son's concern and impressed by the plan, Barthovieu enlists your aid in finding the perfect lumber. Since you cannot seem to think of anything, return to Timbermaster Beatin and ask him.</target>

However, the timbermaster is unsure what specific kind of wood would be best, and directs you to Roiteloin in the central highlands of Coerthas. Speak with this learned botanist in Skyfire Locks, and see what he has to say.</target>
