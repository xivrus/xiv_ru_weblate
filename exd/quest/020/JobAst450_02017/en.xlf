Thanks to your timely intervention, the day is won by your allies. The astrologian thanks you for your aid and Lady Leveva for the constellation map to replace the one destroyed by the bandits. Once the somehow familiar maid has departed, Leveva reminds you of the reason why you are in Mor Dhona, and indicates the spot where you are to survey the skies so that you may open the fifth gate.</target>
