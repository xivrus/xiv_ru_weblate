Alas, the good professor has yet to provide an answer, and so he has no tidings to share at present. Setting that concern aside for the time being, Widargelt invites you to oversee his pupils' training once more. Join him to the west of Revenant's Toll, where training is currently in progress.</target>

Explaining that they have no choice, they fall upon you. In the midst of the encounter, you and Widargelt experience the sensation of a new chakra opening. Upon seeing this, D'zentsa and O'tchakha take their leave, but not before revealing the existence of two sects─one of light and one of shadow, the latter to which they belong. Return to Revenant's Toll and speak with Widargelt about these revelations.</target>
