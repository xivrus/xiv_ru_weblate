You learn that Ortefauchel is in fact a member of the order, and has himself petitioned for lighter, more flexible armor. However, the tradition of using plate mail is deeply rooted, and no one man can overcome it. Unsure of how to proceed, Elde bids you return to the Leatherworkers' Guild with a letter, and pick Geva's brain over how to sell her idea.</target>

Nevertheless, she tells you the tale of one Ciceroix Pondefout. This Ishgardian craftsman worked with the guildmaster several generations back to create the leather-hardening process still used in Wood Wailer and Gods' Quiver armor. Armed with this hopefully useful story, return to Elde along the Jeweled Crozier.</target>

When your turn comes to chime in, you mention Ciceroix Pondefout, and learn this was none other than Elde's grandfather. The artisan had once tried to sell leather armor to the order, but failed and left for Gridania. Elde remembers that she has one old design of his─a chivalric longcoat of aiming─and asks that you fashion this hardy armor now.
