Ansaulme is surprisingly pleased by this development, reasoning that his smallfolk will be safer if his brother's ire is directed at him. However, on learning that the lord regent also plans to lay waste to House Rougecarpe's ancestral fishing holes, his resolve to oust his brother hardens.

In order to assume his lordship, he would need to prove his identity beyond doubt, and the only way to do so is to present the Rougecarpe Ring─the ancient treasure of his house passed down from father to son since time immemorial. Unfortunately, Ansaulme accidentally gifted this ring to the Sea of Clouds, where it was swallowed by a passing cloudfish.
