Despite their best efforts to catch the invasive wavekin, the chocobo hunters are better archers than anglers, and could benefit from the tuition of a practiced fisher&lt;var 08 E905 ((woman)) ((man)) /var&gt;. Reyna bids you follow the Whilom River to the north and rendezvous with the Tailfeather hunter leading the extermination effort.

She is eager to reward you in the same manner as before, but despite racking her brains for a suitably fascinating fishing story, she draws a blank. In her desperation, she turns to Sten, a chocobo hunter of notorious taciturnity. To Reyna's great surprise, he recounts a tale of Far Eastern hellfishing the likes of which she has never heard. Keen to try the sport for herself, she asks you to return to Ansaulme to see if he has any knowledge of the magma worms Sten mentioned in his story.</target>
