Despite their best efforts to catch the invasive wavekin, the chocobo hunters are better archers than anglers, and could benefit from the tuition of a practiced fisher&lt;var 08 E905 ((woman)) ((man)) /var&gt;.

She is eager to reward you in the same manner as before, but despite racking her brains for a suitably fascinating fishing story, she draws a blank. In her desperation, she turns to Sten, a chocobo hunter of notorious taciturnity. To Reyna's great surprise, he recounts a tale of Far Eastern hellfishing the likes of which she has never heard.
