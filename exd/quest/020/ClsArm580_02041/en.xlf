Unsure of the type of shield that would interest a gladiator, however, Benathaire asks that you consult with their former party member. Travel to the Gates of Judgement in the Coerthas central highlands, and seek out Wannmaga.</target>

Continue working alongside the reformed armorer, and take your craft to new heights.
