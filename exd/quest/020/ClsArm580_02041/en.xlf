In order to expedite the recruitment process, the conjurer would have you forge a shield that he means to offer as a bonus to potential applicants. Unsure of the type of shield that would interest a gladiator, however, Benathaire asks that you consult with their former party member.

A short while later, Wannmaga appears, lured by the promise of a titanium hoplon. He and the conjurer immediately begin arguing, but eventually resolve their conflict. Touched by their reunion, a much-changed Blanstyr then arranges to equip the companions with brand-new armor, as part of his new “customer first” philosophy. Continue working alongside the reformed armorer, and take your craft to new heights.

※The next armorer quest will be available from Blanstyr upon reaching level 60.</target>
