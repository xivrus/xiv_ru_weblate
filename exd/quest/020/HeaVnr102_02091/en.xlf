Unfortunately, you have no choice but to invade their fortress again for the good of the realm. Steel yourself to enter the colossus.

As you look on, the treasure hunter searches through the belongings of a fallen goblin, seemingly in vain. When Cid subsequently asks what she is looking for, she tells him that her prize is the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enigma Codex&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;...just as the goblin machinist suggested during your encounter with Quickthinx Allthoughts. The tome, written some hundred years past, apparently holds the plans for a variety of technological wonders. Chief among them is the invention known as “Alexander”─a walking citadel designed to serve as a bastion of reason and logic. Plainly, it is this ideal that gave form to the Illuminati's primal. Return to Biggs, and relate all that you have learned.</target>
