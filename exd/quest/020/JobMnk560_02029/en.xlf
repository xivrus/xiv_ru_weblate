        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBMNK560_02029_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You and Widargelt find O'tchakha in a bad way. She explains that her master, a man named H'raha Tia, forced her and D'zentsa to fight one another to the death. Though O'tchakha once saw the man as a father figure, this incident has opened her eyes to his true nature. O'tchakha now fears for D'zentsa, who is still at their master's mercy. She declares her intent to rescue her, and Widargelt pledges his aid. While the two of them make for the safety of the Hedgetree, Widargelt bids you lie in wait near Eugenia's Spire and intercept any pursuers.</target>

Though Widargelt harbors hopes that he and H'raha Tia may yet come to an understanding, O'tchakha is not confident that her master will be amenable to discussion. More than likely, it will come to blows, and against a powerful foe who has opened all fourteen chakra─seven each of light and shadow. For now, return to Revenant's Toll and discuss a course of action with Widargelt.</target>
