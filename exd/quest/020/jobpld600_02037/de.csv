"","TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_05<tab>You find yourself rather unsurprised by the revelation that Solkzagyl lives, as the former captain reveals himself to be the cloaked man who observed you from atop the cliff at Camp Riversmeet. His was a complex and impenetrable plot to push Constaint towards becoming a paladin and seeking Oathkeeper of his own volition. It is not enough to reclaim Oathkeeper, he states. The sword must be won by a worthy paladin, whose soul is so pure and powerful that all others are driven to yield. However, when two souls cannot reconcile─when one cannot establish dominance, there is but one recourse: a duel. A duel to establish who is truly worthy of Oathkeeper.

"","TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_06<tab>Though he fights bravely and with conviction, Constaint is clearly no match for you. Yet the true test is yet to come. Jenlyns arrives and accuses Solkzagyl of having already recovered Oathkeeper, and the former captain at last reveals the full extent of his plans: to restore the light of the soul crystal once wielded by the first captain of the Sultansworn. In so doing, Solkzagyl hopes to infuse Oathkeeper with the resplendent light with which it once shone. Donning his armor, he demands that you face him in battle. And so you defeat him as well, establishing dominance over his and Constaint's souls.

For thirty years, as captain of the Sultansworn, Solkzagyl strove to live up to the example set by the order's founder. For thirty years, he tried to make Oathkeeper shine, as it did for the legendary captains of eld. It did, one day, but only for a fleeting moment─before it was taken from him and he forswore his oaths to reclaim it. Though you are not a true member of the order, he believes that the sword will shine for you. Gingerly taking the sword from his hands, you hold it aloft, and for a moment, the world is bathed in light. In witnessing its resplendence once more, Solkzagyl seems to find a measure of peace.

The light fades as you hand the sword to Jenlyns, but the captain does not seem to be disappointed. He invites Solkzagyl to return to Ul'dah, and the former captain agrees─though only as a friend and ally, for to leave the order is to leave it forever.","TEXT_JOBPLD600_02037_SEQ_06<tab>Du gewinnst den Zweikampf und schützt deinen Jobkristall.
