However, she is distressed to learn that he is bound for the front lines. Averil has made up her mind to join him when he leaves to keep him safe as a chirurgeon. Now, she must improve her own skills as a conjurer, and asks that you fashion her a hat. But not just a chirurgeon's hat, for then her mother would catch wind of Averil's plans. Instead, the hat must be fashionable. Unfamiliar with fashion herself, Averil asks you to speak with the more dapper townspeople to find out what is in vogue.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSWVR550_02004_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The natty townsfolk have informed you in no uncertain terms that cavalier's hats are in.

Averil uses her magicks to heal him, then introduces him as Freskin, her “special” friend. Before the conversation can go anywhere, however, Averil realizes it would not do for her mother to see her together with Freskin, and shoos him away. After he has gone, she tells you she means to practice her conjury, but will likely have more to ask of you soon.
