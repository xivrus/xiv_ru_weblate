You were right. Our actions here have done more to promote Sharlayan astrology than any long-winded discourse. Why, I expect this very night, the tale of your daring deeds will be told a hundred times over in mead halls across the forelands.</target>

If the one who hired Celie is who I think it is, then I expect naught less than a formal edict of extradition to be issued.</target>

Many even believe it was my father's death that tipped the scales in favor of closing Sharlayan's doors and locking away all our knowledge. If the Forum deems it so, I could be arrested and imprisoned for “the theft of national resources.” And I see no reason why your Holy See, who has already shown its disdain for our efforts, would stand in its way.</target>

And it begins back at Tailfeather healing those who aided us. I will see the two of you in Ishgard once I have settled matters here. Quimperain will see I arrive unharmed.</target>
