He shares with you the knowledge that peerless clarity of sound can be achieved by pairing the hardsilver with an aurum regis cylinder─an item that, coincidentally, Serendipity requires for the upkeep of her favorite mammet. Kill two birds with one stone by fashioning a cylinder for practice and delivering it to the guildmaster.</target>
