        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSGLD580_02073_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Speaking to Master Colbernoux, you learn that the material─hardsilver─from which you intend to fashion the teeth of your music box is the same that he used to create his greatest masterpiece so many years ago. He shares with you the knowledge that peerless clarity of sound can be achieved by pairing the hardsilver with an aurum regis cylinder─an item that, coincidentally, Serendipity requires for the upkeep of her favorite mammet. Kill two birds with one stone by fashioning a cylinder for practice and delivering it to the guildmaster.</target>
