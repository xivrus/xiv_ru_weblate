He bids you go forth and continue to defend the people of Eorzea, and so you do─only to be stopped momentarily by Papashan, former brother of the Sultansworn. Though he has an urgent matter to discuss, he seems loath to do so within earshot of Jenlyns. Journey to the Ul'dah Dispatch Yard and speak with the stationmaster there.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;Solkzagyl, Jenlyns's predecessor, has kept in contact with Papashan for many years, sharing with the stationmaster his discoveries in his quest to reclaim Oathkeeper, the legendary blade stolen from the Sultansworn by the minions of the Monetarists long ago. The former captain's most recent missive contained a startling claim: he has finally found the sword, it would seem. However, Papashan has not heard from him since, and is growing increasingly concerned. The stationmaster does not wish to involve Jenlyns until he has learned more of the situation, and so he begs your assistance, which you readily offer. Once Papashan determines the precise location from which Solkzagyl's last missive was sent, you can begin your search in earnest.

※The next paladin quest will be available from Papashan upon reaching level 52.</target>
