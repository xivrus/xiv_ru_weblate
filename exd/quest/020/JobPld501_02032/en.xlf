The former captain's most recent missive contained a startling claim: he has finally found the sword, it would seem. However, Papashan has not heard from him since, and is growing increasingly concerned. The stationmaster does not wish to involve Jenlyns until he has learned more of the situation, and so he begs your assistance, which you readily offer. Once Papashan determines the precise location from which Solkzagyl's last missive was sent, you can begin your search in earnest.

※The next paladin quest will be available from Papashan upon reaching level 52.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Owyne at Camp Bluefog.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Owyne at the east watchtower.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Slay a fog basilisk.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="27" approved="yes"><source>27</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_TODO_03&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Owyne.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="28" approved="yes"><source>28</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_TODO_04&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Jenlyns in Ul'dah.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="29" approved="yes"><source>29</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_TODO_05&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Papashan at the Ul'dah Dispatch Yard.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_JENLYNS_000_000&lt;tab&gt;We live in troubling times, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;, as you well know.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_JENLYNS_000_001&lt;tab&gt;That is why it is more important than ever that the Sultansworn stand ready to serve as the sword and shield of the sultanate.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="50" approved="yes"><source>50</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_JENLYNS_000_002&lt;tab&gt;For a time, I feared that our order was doomed, but then you helped us to restore our good name.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD501_02032_JENLYNS_000_003&lt;tab&gt;Your shining example inspired many young men and women to seek us out.
