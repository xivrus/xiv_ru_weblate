Without Quimperain, here, I'd have been tied up and shipped back to the Old World moons ago. The stars have him here with me. He is not going anywhere. And neither am I. I am done with symposiums. That is not what my father wanted. He came here not to speak of astrology, he came here to use it. And so that is what I shall do. There are still many Convictors who can benefit from these magicks.</target>

Gods, sometimes these celestial machinations are simply too grand in scope to grasp! However, if it is as we believe, then we must, as Quimperain so bluntly stated, make sure that naught disrupt us on our path to that fate.</target>

Ah, that furrow upon your brow suggests you could have used this spell earlier in your training. In retrospect, I would be inclined to agree. Hah hah!</target>
