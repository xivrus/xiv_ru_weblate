However, the knight continues, House Fortemps cannot provide any aid.

His own brother, Gevehard, put Oschon's Raiders in a terrible position through his rashness years before. Unable to save both his company and his brother, Haimirich chose the former, and left his brother to die. The decision has haunted him since, though he believes it was the right one.
