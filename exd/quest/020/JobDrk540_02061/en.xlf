For that reason, Sidurgu hopes that the conjurers of Stillglade Fane can offer insight into Rielle's condition. He notes that the road to Gridania will offer many opportunities for the Temple Knights to attack. At the very least, you should be safe as far as Camp Dragonhead.</target>

Though the knights are no match for you, their numbers are legion, and you find yourself growing weary from the struggle. However, Rielle's conjury proves surprisingly potent, and you are able to fend off your attackers until you reach the safety of the Observatorium's walls.</target>

Rielle's innate spiritual presence does indeed bear similarities to that of the elementals─and the Dravanians. Citing an ancient legend in which a man ingested the blood of dragons to become one himself, he speculates that Rielle may have partaken of the blood of an ancient Dravanian. Though Sidurgu is unnerved by the implication, Rielle's feelings are unclear, her face an unreadable mask. Before you embark for Ishgard, Brother E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Sumi&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Yan suggests you rest a while at the Carline Canopy.</target>

She pauses, and then, with a faraway look in her eyes, she speaks softly of her imprisonment in a windowless cell, with walls so thick she could not even hear the rain. She denies drinking dragon blood, and claims that she was never accused of such. As for their reasons, she intones that her captors simply said, “it's better this way.” Uncertain how to respond, Sidurgu excuses himself and steps outside, leaving you to look after Rielle until she has finished eating.</target>
