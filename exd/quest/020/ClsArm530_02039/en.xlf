To prepare for the battle, he wishes to have a special light helm made for the party's monk, as Sasapiku refuses to wear any heavy protective gear that would slow him down. Blanstyr claims that no such piece can be crafted of metal, but H'naanza disagrees. Head to Gridania to seek the advice of Geva and Beatin, found in the Leatherworkers' Guild and Carpenters' Guild, respectively.</target>
