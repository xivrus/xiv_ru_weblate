It seems that the adventurers who rescued him out in La Noscea have tasked the old armorer with a troublesome commission. Head over to the Drowning Wench, and speak with Benathaire to learn the details of the request.</target>

To prepare for the battle, he wishes to have a special light helm made for the party's monk, as Sasapiku refuses to wear any heavy protective gear that would slow him down. Blanstyr claims that no such piece can be crafted of metal, but H'naanza disagrees. Head to Gridania to seek the advice of Geva and Beatin, found in the Leatherworkers' Guild and Carpenters' Guild, respectively.</target>

Continue to improve at your trade that you might provide a less life-threatening example for the old armorer to follow.
