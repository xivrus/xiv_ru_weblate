        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS701_01556_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Nojiro tells you of a portal in the South Shroud that has set Gridania's rumor mill to spinning. While it sounds like nothing more than a fanciful fabrication, he explains his tale comes straight from the Wood Wailers who dared to enter. As he heard it, the portal leads to a labyrinth that changes its design every time scouts enter its long-abandoned halls. Though the potential for spoils intrigues him, he finds the risk is not worth the reward. If you should be bold enough to enter, however, he bids you speak with the Wood Wailers at the mouth of Issom-Har to learn more.</target>
