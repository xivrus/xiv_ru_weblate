Jezul Ahuatan the Second knows that where the monetary system holds no sway, barter must come into greater play.

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANIXA602_01521_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Jezul Ahuatan has bamboozled you into crafting spare tank components. But first, you must reap what you have─or rather, some other botanist has─sown. The forests around Camp Dragonhead are rich in quality timber; harvest fifteen ruby spruce branches and five ruby spruce logs.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
