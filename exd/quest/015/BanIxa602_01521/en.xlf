Jezul Ahuatan the Second knows that where the monetary system holds no sway, barter must come into greater play.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 16 and above.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANIXA602_01521_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Jezul Ahuatan has bamboozled you into crafting spare tank components. But first, you must reap what you have─or rather, some other botanist has─sown. The forests around Camp Dragonhead are rich in quality timber; harvest fifteen ruby spruce branches and five ruby spruce logs.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
