However, before you can do so, you must obtain the requisite materials from a shale golem, which can be lured out of hiding by slaying clay golems in Alder Springs. If you have difficulty defeating the shale golem, you can use the dissolving agent provided by Methuli Cattlan to weaken it.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
