Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks a skilled Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in the creation of intricate components.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 15 and above.</target>

Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

Currently, the guild is in short supply of tangle skippers─a rare variety of air-breathing fish from which medicine for the pox is brewed. Travel west to the Tangle and catch two skippers using moth pupae.</target>
