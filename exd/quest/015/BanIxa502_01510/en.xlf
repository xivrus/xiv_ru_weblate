Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks a similarly steady-handed Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in the creation of frangible components.

Proper equipment to craft the lighting, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANIXA502_01510_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. Currently, the guild is building an orphanage and is in short supply of lumber. Travel west to the Tangle and gather fifteen mangrove branches and five mangrove logs.</target>
