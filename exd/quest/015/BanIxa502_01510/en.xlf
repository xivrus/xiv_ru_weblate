Proper equipment to craft the lighting, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

Currently, the guild is building an orphanage and is in short supply of lumber. Travel west to the Tangle and gather fifteen mangrove branches and five mangrove logs.</target>
