        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSD019_01530_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;After welcoming you back to Little Solace, Frixio explains that the touched sylphs─fueled by fear and anger─have once more summoned their thunderous god. Though adamant that Ramuh holds no destructive agenda, the elder sylph admits that the primal's very presence is a danger to the land. The Lord of Levin must be defeated, not only to protect the realm, but also to teach his vengeful thralls the futility of their actions. Head deep into the territory of the touched sylphs and attune yourself to the Sylphlands aetheryte.</target>
