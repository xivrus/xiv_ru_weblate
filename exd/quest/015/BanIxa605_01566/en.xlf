A crafter makes and a warrior unmakes. What then is an adventurer, who does both and more?
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 16 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 49 and above.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANIXA605_01566_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Jezul Ahuatan wonders if you might be able to craft some hyperconductor components. You must begin by collecting an unusual material. In the Ogre's Belly in the Coerthas highlands, there are many fell things─among them a swarm of will-o'-the-wykes. Slaying one will draw the ire of St. Daniffen's fire, from the vanquished husk of which you can obtain a sample of semi-stable ectoplasm.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
