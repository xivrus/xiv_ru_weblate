Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANIXA504_01512_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. Currently, the guild has need of morbol vines, which will be used to craft stronger ropes for the miners who scale the mountains of Mor Dhona. Travel to the Tangle and slay a resident morbol for its feelers.</target>
