Wishing to know how things stand in the sultanate prior to any rescue attempt, he has arranged to meet with the Admiral, and bids you join him. Make your way to Bulwark Hall on Limsa Lominsa's lower decks and speak with Storm Sergeant Zanthael to be admitted to the Bridge.</target>

Since word of this troubling development arrived, the shinobi of Doma have been frantically gathering intelligence on the Flame General's whereabouts, and the Admiral bids you seek out her Doman contact, a female frontier hand currently working in a kitchen at Revenant's Toll.</target>

During the ill-fated victory feast, members of the Crystal Braves seized the Rising Stones by force, but she and a number of her compatriots were able to escape. Grateful for the kindness the Scions showed to them, the Domans stand ready to aid in Raubahn's rescue.</target>
