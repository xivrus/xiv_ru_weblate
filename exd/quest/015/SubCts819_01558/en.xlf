        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS819_01558_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;While normally delighted by the company of her patrons at the Seventh Heaven, Alys is at a loss about how to console a particular customer. Eginolf, a renowned craftsman and regular at the tavern, has been more than voracious with his drinking of late, and Alys suspects he is beleaguered with work-related problems. To put an end to his troubles, and preserve the decorum of her establishment, she asks that you speak with him, that his mind may be put at ease. Make your way to Rowena's House of Splendors and speak with Eginolf to discover the cause of his distress.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS819_01558_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You speak with Eginolf, and discover the source of his troubles is an arduous undertaking at the behest of his employer, the trader Rowena. Tasked with creating a new line of wares, the likes of which the realm has never known, he was at a loss as to how he could fulfill his duty to her. Meeting you, however, has inspired a return to the basics, that he may better tailor his wares to the adventurers who would purchase them. As thanks, he offers to dye your artifact armor any color you desire. After acquiring the necessary augmentation item, try speaking with his assistant, Kakalan.</target>
