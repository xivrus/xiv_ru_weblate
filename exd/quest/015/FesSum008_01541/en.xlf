				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Mayaru Moyaru is quite the demon whisperer; confined within the event venue are womandragoras and sabotenders both. Use any of the 18-ponze cannons at your disposal to batter the former twice and the latter once.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

How wonderful it is to see the smiles of the children, and watch them run after the cannonballs. Some actions cannot be undone, but you may always return to the Cannon&lt;var 1F /var&gt;do Spirit.</target>

I do believe you understand the spirit of &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;restraint&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; and precision that is so important in professional adventurers. Now blast that 18&lt;var 1F /var&gt;ponze cannon! You must hit the womandragoras twice and any one sabotender fugitivo once.</target>

Aim well─stray cannonballs are &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;not&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; appropriate for family events! And don't be shy─you can try the event as many times as you like. Do tell me when you've succeeded, however.</target>

Stronger leadership certainly wouldn't have been amiss, but we simply couldn't agree on whom to elect the chief chaperone.
