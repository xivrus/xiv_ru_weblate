        <target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM008_01541_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Mayaru Moyaru is quite the demon whisperer; confined within the event venue are womandragoras and sabotenders both. Use any of the 18-ponze cannons at your disposal to batter the former twice and the latter once.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

I do believe you understand the spirit of &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;restraint&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; and precision that is so important in professional adventurers.

Aim well─stray cannonballs are &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;not&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; appropriate for family events! And don't be shy─you can try the event as many times as you like. Do tell me when you've succeeded, however.</target>
