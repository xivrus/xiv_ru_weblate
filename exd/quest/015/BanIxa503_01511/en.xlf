Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks a dedicated Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in the creation of durable components.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 15 and above.</target>

Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANIXA503_01511_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. The forgewife believes that fifteen clear water shards and five clear water clusters should suffice. Why the Adventurers' Guild would need something obviously more suited for use in, say, a forge, is probably best left unspoken.</target>
