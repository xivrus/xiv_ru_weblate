Assuming you two to be friends, the Wood Wailer asks that you go to the Druthers and see what you can do to console this ale-sodden soul.</target>

However, when he hops down from his chair, you realize it is Paiyo Reiyo, whom you once rescued from the Tam&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Tara Deepcroft. He tells you he has been plagued by thoughts of Edda ever since and is taken aback when you tell him of your encounter with the fallen mage in the Palace of the Dead. You hand him her engagement ring and a look of remorse passes his face. After a few moments, he then asks you to accompany him outside.</target>

The problem, however, was that there were no bodies to bury─a problem for which he found a solution the moment he thought of Edda's ring. He plans to use their engagement rings for the service. All he requires now is Avere's ring, which just so happens to be in the river near Buscarron's Druthers.</target>
