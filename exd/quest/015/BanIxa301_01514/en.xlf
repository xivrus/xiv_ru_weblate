				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANIXA301_01514_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Rozol Cattlan the Prudent has asked for your assistance in the crafting of high-quality components for the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Dezul Qualan&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;'s cockpit exterior. However, before you can gain access to the facilities necessary for the synthesis, you must first find a way to bribe the young Highwind Skyways representative in charge of overseeing the equipment. Rozol believes you may be able to achieve this with a saint carp─a rare type of fish living in the frigid waters of the Coerthas River to the west of the Observatorium. It is said that saint carp are best caught with moth pupae.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

Now hurry the fish to Templeton at the Observatorium while it is still fresh, and convince the corrupt lad to grant you use of the crafting facilities. It may also be wise to allow him to inspect the materials entrusted to you by Rozol, so as not to arouse suspicion amongst his ever-watching superiors.</target>

Use the materials given to you by Rozol and inspected by Templeton to synthesize two high-quality cockpit exterior components, and deliver the finished products to Ehcatl.

※In the event that the status &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;Facility Access: Production II&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Templeton.</target>
