To simply soar above their earthbound brethren is not enough; they must do so in an airship both powerful and aesthetically pleasing. To this end, Jezul Ahuatan would have you meet with a brother of Ehcatl in Natalan, who has infiltrated enemy ranks and stolen the materials needed to craft high-quality decorative plating components. Venture within the Ixali stronghold and, with the chat mode in &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;Say&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, enter the password “Amid the Flowers” to identify yourself as a friend.
