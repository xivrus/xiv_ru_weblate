To simply soar above their earthbound brethren is not enough; they must do so in an airship both powerful and aesthetically pleasing. To this end, Jezul Ahuatan would have you meet with a brother of Ehcatl in Natalan, who has infiltrated enemy ranks and stolen the materials needed to craft high-quality decorative plating components. Venture within the Ixali stronghold and, with the chat mode in &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;Say&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, enter the password “Amid the Flowers” to identify yourself as a friend.

Indeed, when the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Dezul Qualan&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, that shining culmination of the Ehcatl Nine's hard work, one day takes flight, you can take pride in knowing that the obnoxious decorations which grace its hull are but one of your countless contributions.</target>
