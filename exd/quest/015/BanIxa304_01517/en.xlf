Rozol Cattlan the Prudent requests the aid of a Disciple of the Hand, and according to the faction knotcounter, you are the only featherless one he trusts with the task.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 6 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 45 and above.</target>

Impressed with your work on larger items, Rozol Cattlan believes it time to test your hand at tasks which require more precision. The materials he was able to provide you with; however, the bribe for young Templeton you will have to earn on your own. For whatever reason, he requires a biast claw, of all things. Fortunately, the hills to the west of the Observatorium are literally crawling with hungry biasts.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
