A wise Ixal knows well the value of auxiliary systems, and Jezul Ahuatan the Second is no exception.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 16 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 49 and above.</target>

Although their model is nearly complete, it lacks a key component─a component which can only be crafted with materials currently in the possession of the Ixal dwelling in Natalan. Though it be a dangerous task, you have no choice but to infiltrate the stronghold and steal the materials.
