As she tells it, an enterprising young trader formerly employed at the House of Splendors recently paid off her debt to Rowena and struck out on her own, and the sisters would see to it that the girl's new venture is a success. Vowing to offer what aid you can, you set out for the Hard Place to seek out one Zhloe Aliapoh.</target>

She asks for your aid in procuring exotic treasures that she might then unload on her most affluent customers, thus securing the necessary funds to keep Menphina's Arms thriving. To ensure a mutually beneficial arrangement, she offers to pay for every item you deliver in scrips that can be redeemed at her good friend and associate Rowena's House of Splendors. Seeing no cause to doubt her zeal and business acumen, you resolve to do your part to help the girl achieve her most admirable goal.</target>

Born into poverty, she worked her tail off for my sister until she'd paid off every last gil of her family's debts. Recently, she struck out on her own, rentin' out a corner of the Hard Place to run her own shop.</target>

I haven't actually &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;asked&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; her yet, of course, but I'm sure she'll say yes. Did I mention that we were really, really good friends?</target>
