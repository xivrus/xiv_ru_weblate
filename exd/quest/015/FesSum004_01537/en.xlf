What exactly makes it so rousing, he would not say. You will find the answer at the Blind Iron Mines from a chaperone called Ethelia.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESSUM004_01537_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Ethelia is rather more cavalier than you expected of a chaperone, but it is surely a sign of her confidence in your ability to handle a large, ill-tempered monster traditionally in the employ of your sworn enemies. The clamor of the children grows louder; give your assent to Ethelia, mount the elbst, and commence the waterworks.</target>

Nothing wrong with that─if I don't mete out a good beating once a moon, I go a bit crazy─but we've other skills that are going mostly unused. Fighting fire's one of the big ones.</target>

I didn't! They're massed in lower La Noscea right now, near the entrance to the Blind Iron Mines. Was I supposed to go inspect? Maybe later!
