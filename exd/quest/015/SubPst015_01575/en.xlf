The deputy postmoogle bids you make a second attempt: brave the Ixali gauntlet to Eugenia's Spire, and place the letter in the unyielding hands of Miah Molkot, ferocious leader of the White Rams.</target>

Terrified at the fate that awaits him at the hands of the famous Black Cat, the Ixal proffers a deal: in exchange for his life, he and his comrades will find Philota and her grandson, and return them unharmed.

For the Ixal to have kidnapped the boy is an insult to the White Rams' honor, and Miah will stop at nothing until those responsible are brought to her own personal brand of justice. She asks you to return to Philota, now resting at the Bobbing Cork, and assure her that her grandson will be saved.</target>

Not only have the Ixal been taunting the White Rams by roaming the Twelveswood at will, using the boy as a shield, they now appear to be repairing to their own lands with the child in tow. Just as Miah is about to give the order to strike, a message comes from her scouts: true to their word, the Ixal have released Philota's grandson near Proud Creek. Fearing for his safety, Miah urges you to assist her men in finding the child before something more dastardly does.</target>

He explains to you how the Ixal who held him hostage were not an invasion force, but a rescue team, hunting for a missing hatchling. Furthermore, the chieftain who released the boy left behind some strange words that seem to relate to some forgotten past. But Proud Creek is no place to linger in thought─you link up with another of the search team, who agrees to convey the boy back to the relative safety of Eugenia's Spire. Rendezvous with them there, and report these latest developments to Instructor Molkot.</target>

Twenty years earlier, the White Rams, under the leadership of Philota's late son, released Ixali hatchlings to secure the safety of a young girl─a girl by the name of Miah Molkot. By the Ixali headwing's words, he could only be one of those hatchlings whose life was spared in exchange for hers. Unwilling to sever the ties of destiny put in place by her master so long before, Miah Molkot calls off the attack. And so, after twenty long years, a temporary truce returns to the Twelveswood.</target>
