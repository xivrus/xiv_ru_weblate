Fearing the malign intervention of the Ixal, she bids you seek out her man in Treespeak, slaying any birdman you should encounter along the way.</target>

Terrified at the fate that awaits him at the hands of the famous Black Cat, the Ixal proffers a deal: in exchange for his life, he and his comrades will find Philota and her grandson, and return them unharmed.

As proof of their word, Philota is to be released in advance, on the cliffs overlooking Fallgourd Float. Go to her, and ensure her safety.</target>

Just as Miah is about to give the order to strike, a message comes from her scouts: true to their word, the Ixal have released Philota's grandson near Proud Creek. Fearing for his safety, Miah urges you to assist her men in finding the child before something more dastardly does.</target>

Furthermore, the chieftain who released the boy left behind some strange words that seem to relate to some forgotten past.

Twenty years earlier, the White Rams, under the leadership of Philota's late son, released Ixali hatchlings to secure the safety of a young girl─a girl by the name of Miah Molkot. By the Ixali headwing's words, he could only be one of those hatchlings whose life was spared in exchange for hers. Unwilling to sever the ties of destiny put in place by her master so long before, Miah Molkot calls off the attack. And so, after twenty long years, a temporary truce returns to the Twelveswood.</target>
