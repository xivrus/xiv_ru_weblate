Rozol Cattlan the Prudent requests the aid of a skilled Disciple of the Hand who is content with keeping &lt;var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var&gt; head down and most certainly not asking any questions.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 6 and above.</target>

Materials for these components have already been delivered part of the way to the Observatorium, and you need only collect them from the Ehcatl Nine carrier waiting at Skyfire Locks. Prove you are a friend of the Nine by entering the password “Now Fall” with the chat mode in &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;Say&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; where the carrier can hear you. Also, speak with Roiteloin of the Locks and ask if he has any pine lumber scraps (with which to bribe Templeton, of course).
