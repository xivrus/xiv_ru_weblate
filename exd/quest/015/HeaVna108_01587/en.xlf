        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA108_01587_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;A reconnaissance party sent north to Riversmeet in search of the heretics' hideaway has gone missing, and though he knows not the cause, Ser Redwald believes time is of the essence. Accordingly, he has dispatched several parties to search for the missing knights, each assigned to a different area. You and Lord Artoirel are to comprise one such party. Seek out your partner and speak with him when you are ready to depart.</target>

Follow the young lord to the cliffs overlooking the camp from the south.</target>
