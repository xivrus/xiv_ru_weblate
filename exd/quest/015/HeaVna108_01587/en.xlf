Accordingly, he has dispatched several parties to search for the missing knights, each assigned to a different area. You and Lord Artoirel are to comprise one such party. Seek out your partner and speak with him when you are ready to depart.</target>

Like Falcon's Nest, it was abandoned following the Calamity, but that does not discount the possibility that the missing knights may have taken shelter there. Follow the young lord to the cliffs overlooking the camp from the south.</target>

Convinced that the heretics' hideaway lies somewhere to the north, he begs you to help him continue the search─though he is clearly in no condition to do so...</target>
