				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANIXA303_01516_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Content with your work on previous dirigible components, Rozol Cattlan the Prudent has asked for your assistance in the crafting of a high-quality component for the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Dezul Qualan&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;'s ballast. The materials for the task can be acquired from an independent sutler named Duvicauroix who is known to peddle his wares in and around the Observatorium. Also, you will need to procure a bribe for the finicky Templeton. Rozol has provided you with a shearing knife with which you are to remove the beard of one of the feral crocs lurking about Skyfire Locks.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

Use the materials given to you by the Duvicauroix and inspected by Templeton to synthesize a high-quality ballast component, and deliver the finished product to the faction.

After this success, the Ixal seems to have given up his feeble attempts to hide his amazement at your work. As for Templeton, the lad seems overly bold in his demands, causing you to worry how much longer this mummer's farce can continue before someone of standing within the Highwind Skyways hierarchy learns of their representative's misdeeds and reassigns him to someplace darker and colder than even Coerthas.</target>
