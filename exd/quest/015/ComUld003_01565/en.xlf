If you would see what the officer is so excited about, a visit to the Hall of Flames is in order. You may present yourself to the Hunt billmaster to learn more.</target>

He is also the man to go to should you require more information on the subject, or if you have hard-earned Allied Seals to turn in. For now, do your part to preserve the peace, and you will be richly rewarded.</target>

They're to be marked for extermination, praise the Traders, and such rewards as befit the task paid out. They call it the Hunt, a prosaic sort of name if you ask me.</target>

I might say that cooperation on this point hardly makes a lie of the competition in less, ah, fecund areas. If there is enough to share, we share. If not, then it's survival of the fittest.</target>

There's the regular kind for regular wares─pardon me, regular blackguards─and an elite mark bill for something a bit more special. Stronger, more murderous, and so forth. Before you take one of these on, you may want to consult a hunter-scholar. That's a veteran of the Hunt who knows the Raimdelle Codex by heart.</target>
