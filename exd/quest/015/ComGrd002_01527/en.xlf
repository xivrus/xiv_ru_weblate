Nevertheless, their disagreements have not been irreconcilable─until now. Control of the Carteneau Flats is to be decided on the field of battle, and Lieutenant Scarlet would have you fight for the Twin Adder. Speak with the Yellow Serpent flyer to learn more of this new conflict, and to decide if you wish to become involved.</target>
