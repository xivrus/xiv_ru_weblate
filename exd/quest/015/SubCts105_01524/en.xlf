        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS105_01524_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Paiyo Reiyo has received a wedding invitation from a former adventuring comrade, a lass named Edda with whom you are acquainted. While impending matrimonial festivities would ordinarily be a cause for gladness, the fact that the groom-to-be is no longer among the living has left the Lalafell deeply perturbed. Paiyo Reiyo indicates that he means to consult a former comrade and fellow invitee regarding the strange affair, only to learn from you that she, too, has been dead for some time. Racked by uncertainty, he requests to see Liavinne's grave with his own eyes. Meet Paiyo Reiyo at the Church of Saint Adama Landama, and show him where your fellow Scion was laid to rest.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS105_01524_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Arriving at the lichyard, Paiyo Reiyo is dismayed to find Liavinne's grave despoiled and her body missing. He believes that Edda is the one responsible, having lost her battle with despair in the aftermath of her fiancé's death. The Lalafell departs for the Tam&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Tara Deepcroft forthwith, determined to put an end to whatever madness his erstwhile comrade is about to commit. Given Edda's admiration for you, it seems likely that your presence will prove valuable to this endeavor. Make your own way to the Deepcroft, and speak with the Wood Wailer guarding the entrance.</target>
