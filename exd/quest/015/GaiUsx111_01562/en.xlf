There's a job that might be too much for those who have expressed an interest. We'd like you to handle this one, before an unprepared adventurer meets an untimely end.</target>

Someone needs to take care of them so the scouts can make progress. Not that I've no faith in the other volunteers, but I suspect few of them have stood against a hapalit.</target>
