The Camp Dragonhead area is a garden of earthly delights to a seasoned prospector such as yourself. Prise fifteen chunks of furite and five chunks of high-quality furite from the ground to trade for much-needed crafting materials.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
