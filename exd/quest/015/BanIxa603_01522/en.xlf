According to Jezul Ahuatan the Second, regard is to be treasured, praise is to be enjoyed, and flattery discarded for the dross it is.

But first, you must attend to a miner─er, minor─detail. The Camp Dragonhead area is a garden of earthly delights to a seasoned prospector such as yourself. Prise fifteen chunks of furite and five chunks of high-quality furite from the ground to trade for much-needed crafting materials.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
