He has scarce begun to speak, however, when his steward bursts in, bearing grave tidings: Alphinaud and Tataru have been arrested by a knight of the Heavens' Ward─one “Ser Grinnaux”─on the charge of fomenting heresy. Ask the count for his counsel.</target>

Reasoning that Ser Aymeric will know the exact nature of the allegations, Edmont advises you to pay the lord commander a visit at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly.</target>

These twelve chosen sers answer to none save the archbishop himself, and their testimony is unimpeachable. As such, under Ishgardian law, only the Fury Herself can disprove Ser Grinnaux's claims...by granting victory in a trial by combat between the accuser and the accused. Owing to his magical talents, Alphinaud must fight, but Tataru may claim the right to name a champion. And who else but the Warrior of Light could stand against the might of the Heavens' Ward? Make your preparations and speak to Lord Haurchefant in the Supreme Sacred Tribunal of Halonic Inquisitory Doctrine when you are ready to face the knights in battle.</target>
