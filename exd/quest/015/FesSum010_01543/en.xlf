The first is a lavish selection of fireworks, currently in the safekeeping of another chaperone. The second is quite a different set of tailfeathers─a lesson in dance of the Eastern tradition. Don your &lt;var 08 E905 ((red lady's yukata)) ((blue lord's yukata)) /var&gt; and ask the Moonfire chaperone in the Aftcastle about the fireworks.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
