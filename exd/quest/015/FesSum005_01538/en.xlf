More civilized-like and crispy, was my way of thinking. That's why I sit in the big chair, I fancy.

Demon slaying, and lots of it! We've acquired some nice 18-ponze cannons. They make a big bang when they're fired at their targets─sabotenders and womandragoras in this case!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="58" approved="yes"><source>58</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM005_01538_MAYARUMOYARU_000_032&lt;tab&gt;And don't go hitting anything other than your intended targets!
