Rozol Cattlan the Prudent requests the aid of a Disciple of the Hand with sufficient elbow grease to see &lt;var 08 E905 ((her)) ((him)) /var&gt; smoothly through a difficult task.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 6 and above.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANIXA305_01518_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Rozol Cattlan has asked you to synthesize for him a component for the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Dezul Qualan&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;'s aerodynamo─a delicate instrument which will help keep the airship aloft after takeoff. The Ehcatl Nine knotcounter has personally spoken with Templeton and does not believe you will need to bribe the Highwind Skyways representative to gain access to the crafting facilities at the Observatorium. The knotcounter also does not believe a thing Templeton says, so he warns you to be ready to perform some random task for the unappreciative sot.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
