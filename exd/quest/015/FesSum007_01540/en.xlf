        <target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM007_01540_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Someone once said that one can see more clearly while astride an elbst. Whether or not that's so, it would be hard to miss the fires burning merrily in three designated spots in Cedarwood. Go forth, elbst rider, and Saturate the flames with water, cold and clear.</target>
