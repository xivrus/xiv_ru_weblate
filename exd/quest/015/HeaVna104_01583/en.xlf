				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_HEAVNA104_01583_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Ser Artoirel de Fortemps, eldest son of Count Edmont de Fortemps, did not expect to have company on his mission to aid houses Durendaire and Dzemael─a prospect he was not particularly enthusiastic about in the first place, given the ancient rivalries between Ishgard's noble families. Worse, in electing to install you at his son's side, the count has given Artoirel cause to believe that his father does not trust him to carry out his duties alone. Regardless, the knight means to respect Edmont's wishes, and bids you join him at the chocobo stables in Foundation, where you will secure transport to Falcon's Nest.</target>
