Haermaga feels that of all Moonfire Faire events, this is the one most suited to your talents. Seek out J'nangho down by the Zephyr Gate and ask about the Very Cherry Bomb event.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
