				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESSUM009_01542_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Combining high-explosives disposal and crowd-pleasing pyrotechnics takes a merry heart and a steady hand. Follow J'nangho's instructions to chase flaming Bombard blanks towards a mortar full of fireworks. Whether to use the northern or the eastern venue is entirely up to you.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESSUM009_01542_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Off go the fireworks, the bomb core turns to ashes, and, as J'nangho predicted, the crowd goes wild. It would only be fair to let her know that she was right.</target>
