That said, he would hear the opinions of his loyal followers before placing his final order.

After the sisters depart, he proceeds to reveal their past, beginning from when the Brass Blades freed the two from slavery as young girls. Years later, having reached womanhood and hearing many tales about the Longhaft's unit, they sought him out and offered their services. Moved by this touching tale of pure love and devotion, you resolve to lend your strength to Hunberct and his regiment should you come upon them at Highbridge.</target>
