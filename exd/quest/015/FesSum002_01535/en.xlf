※This quest is available for a limited time only.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;According to a roving chaperone of the Moonfire Faire, the Adventurers' Guild is looking for members willing to help with the festivities. As a proud &lt;var 08 E905 ((guildswoman)) ((guildsman)) /var&gt; and something of a sartorial adventurer, it would behoove you to slip on a &lt;var 08 E905 ((red lady's yukata)) ((blue lord's yukata)) /var&gt; and take yourself to the Aftcastle. If the chief chaperone, Haermaga, is all that he is promised to be, this transaction would prove to be in your favor.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Haermaga is a trifle vague on the rationale of these festivities, but quite clear on the matter of reward. In return for participating in three events, you will receive prizes, plus a special costume. Your summer wardrobe is a little lacking, and it would be well for the commonfolk to see what an adventurer is made of. And if that should prove insufficient motivation, do it for the children.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Don a &lt;var 08 E905 ((lady's yukata (red))) ((lord's yukata (blue))) /var&gt; and speak with Haermaga.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM002_01535_EXABU01535_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Psst, adventurer!
