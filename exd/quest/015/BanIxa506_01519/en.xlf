Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks a discerning Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in fixing the flaws of vital components.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 15 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 48 and above.</target>

Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANIXA506_01519_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Fyrbryda's rules for the forge are simple: one, all materials brought inside must be inspected for contraband, and two, if anyone wishes to make use of the facilities, they must first provide a generous contribution to the Revenant's Toll chapter of the Adventurers' Guild. Currently, the guild is concerned about a group of Coerthans harassing travelers who pass near Camp Revenant's Toll. Make your way to their campsite and force them to leave, by any means necessary.</target>
