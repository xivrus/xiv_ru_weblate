One by one, your comrades remained behind in a bid to aid your escape, until you alone emerged from the tunnels beneath Ul'dah to be reunited with Alphinaud and seek refuge in Coerthas. But will you ever find sanctuary behind the walls of Ishgard? Having bided your time in Camp Dragonhead for what feels like an age, you finally have your answer: &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;yes&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. As wards of House Fortemps, you will be granted admission to the city proper. Haurchefant will tell you more.</target>
