Duzal Meyean the Steady seeks a reliable Disciple of the Hand to assist his team of crafts...birds in the creation of prototype components.
※The crafting portion of this quest is recommended for Disciples of the Hand level 15 and above, and the battle portion for Disciples of War or Magic level 48 and above.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANIXA505_01513_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Duzal Meyean has asked you to synthesize a ceruleum tank component to improve his prototype for the airship &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Dezul Qualan&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. Proper equipment to craft these items, however, is only found at the Diamond Forge in Revenant's Toll. Speak with forgewife Fyrbryda about receiving permission to utilize the facilities.
