        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA117_01596_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Lady Laniaitte is shocked to hear that the Vanu have summoned a primal, and all agree that its presence must be behind the recent rise in Vanu hostility. Sensing his moment, Lord Emmanellain rather bluntly demands that the true hero of the hour be recognized, and for once, Lady Laniaitte agrees...and praises you for rescuing the young lord from a doom of his own making. More than satisfied with your efforts, she then invites you to return to Ishgard with Lord Haurchefant, prompting Lord Emmanellain to conclude that he too is no longer needed. Make your journey back to the city and speak with Lord Haurchefant once you have arrived.</target>
