Within the ruins lies a treasure apparently worth risking life and limb over, and she asks that you aid her companions in obtaining it.

Unfortunately, they lack the strength to fend off the beasts prowling the ruins where their prize presently rests. Eager to secure your aid in eliminating the creatures, Sawney offers to let you keep anything you find along the way. Venture into Saint Mocianne's Arboretum and clear a path for the treasure hunters so that they may search the ruins unimpeded.
