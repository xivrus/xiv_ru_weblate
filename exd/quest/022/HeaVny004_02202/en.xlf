Within the ruins lies a treasure apparently worth risking life and limb over, and she asks that you aid her companions in obtaining it. Speak with the treasure hunter named Sawney in front of the Arboretum to join the search.</target>

Unfortunately, they lack the strength to fend off the beasts prowling the ruins where their prize presently rests. Eager to secure your aid in eliminating the creatures, Sawney offers to let you keep anything you find along the way. Venture into Saint Mocianne's Arboretum and clear a path for the treasure hunters so that they may search the ruins unimpeded.

※Saint Mocianne's Arboretum can be accessed via the Duty Finder.</target>

Midnight Dew hopes to use them to start a new industry in Idyllshire, and thereby free the settlement of its reliance on an ever-diminishing supply of Sharlayan junk. Even as Sawney departs to plant his treasure, you are cordially invited to visit Idyllshire in the near future to sample the bountiful harvest that the seeds will inevitably produce.</target>
