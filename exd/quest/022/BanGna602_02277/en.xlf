Aside from the name stenciled neatly on the parcel, the only tidbit of information he has to go on is that Uhm Ala has yellow scales. Unfortunately, many dragons residing in the towers fit this description. He thinks that maybe an experienced adventurer like you will have better luck delivering the package, and asks that you take over this assignment for him.
