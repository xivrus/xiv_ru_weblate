        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA602_02277_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;All of the Vath keeneye's attempts to deliver a package addressed to a dragon by the name of Uhm Ala have ended in dismal failure. Aside from the name stenciled neatly on the parcel, the only tidbit of information he has to go on is that Uhm Ala has yellow scales. Unfortunately, many dragons residing in the towers fit this description. He thinks that maybe an experienced adventurer like you will have better luck delivering the package, and asks that you take over this assignment for him. With the chat mode in &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;Say&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter any phrase that contains the name “Uhm Ala” to find the dragon whose package remains undelivered.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.</target>
