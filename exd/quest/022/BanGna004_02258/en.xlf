        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;After an awkward attempt at a prank, the deftarm is eager to tell you about a daring idea he has. In a bid to put an end to the colony's thieving of clay, he wishes to venture to Anyx Trine, another area rich with the deposits, albeit a lair of the Gnath's hated enemy, the Dravanians. Knowing well he would face certain death were he to travel alone, he recalls you have met with the dragons before, and requests you to accompany him to formally ask the dragons for permission to harvest the clay─an idea the Onemind would not dare to consider.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA004_02258_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Vidofnir grants you an audience, but is soon perplexed as to why you brought a Gnath into her presence. The deftarm quickly explains that he is Vath, not Gnath, and that they have a need to strengthen their settlement's walls. He further stresses that by aiding their cause, the Dravanians would benefit from their presence as a buffer between Anyx Trine and Loth ast Gnath. Still suspicious of his loyalties, however, Vidofnir declares that the deftarm must first prove he is not in league with the Gnath by slaying one. Despite his reservations, the deftarm has no choice but to agree.</target>

The storyteller is delighted to hear that the hive has finally weaned themselves from the Gnath's resources, and of the deftarm's personal victory of resisting the link to the Onemind. For the moment, Loth ast Vath seems to be turning out for the better...that is, until the deftarm falls deep into a trance, speaking in a different tone. The speaker soon reveals himself as the Overmind of Loth ast Gnath, using the deftarm as a mouthpiece with which to deliver a message: rejoin the main colony, or perish. When the deftarm regains himself, he is dismayed by the colony's crisis, and commits himself to finding a way to avoid war.</target>
