In a bid to put an end to the colony's thieving of clay, he wishes to venture to Anyx Trine, another area rich with the deposits, albeit a lair of the Gnath's hated enemy, the Dravanians. Knowing well he would face certain death were he to travel alone, he recalls you have met with the dragons before, and requests you to accompany him to formally ask the dragons for permission to harvest the clay─an idea the Onemind would not dare to consider.
