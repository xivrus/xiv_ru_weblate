You are to form a party of two with one other adventurer whose compatibility in wealth, adventure, and love you wish to have known.

The emissary gives you three Valentione's cards that contain all the information required to make an accurate reading. Take your cards, and go before each of the fortune-tellers to hear their prophecies.
