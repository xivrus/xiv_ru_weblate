You are to form a party of two with one other adventurer whose compatibility in wealth, adventure, and love you wish to have known. One of you must wear the platinum paramour's earrings, and the other must wear the paramour's earrings before having your fortunes told. The emissary gives you three Valentione's cards that contain all the information required to make an accurate reading. Take your cards, and go before each of the fortune-tellers to hear their prophecies.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
