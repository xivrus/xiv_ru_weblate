        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNC105_02235_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Old habits are hard to break, as Emmanellain soon proves. Upon realizing that his brother asked you to look after him, the young lord proceeds to press you into duty, bidding you patrol several locations outside Falcon's Nest where wolves have been sighted. Before you can voice your opinion on the matter, Emmanellain vanishes, leaving you with little choice but to carry out the menial task.</target>

In passing, he mentions that he spoke with Thancred─or the “grizzled fellow” who “made that arsonist confess,” as he puts it─while you were away, and that he employed the same devious techniques on him that he used to press you into wolf-slaying duty. With a sigh, you turn your attention to the wastes outside Falcon's Nest once more.</target>
