After exploring several theories, you have no choice but to consider the possibility that something is odd about the passage of time within the barrier around Alexander. At a loss to know how to proceed, Biggs suggests seeking Cid's opinion, and Wedge duly requests his presence via linkpearl. All that remains is to await the arrival of the Ironworks' finest mind.</target>

Fearing the worst, you rush to gain a better view of Alexander, and Cid witnesses a surprising phenomenon: the flow of aether that had been leaking from the primal reverses, as if time itself had been turned back. For all their combined knowledge, neither Cid nor Y'shtola can offer a credible explanation for this unprecedented event, and they are forced to concede that Alexander may possess a means to manipulate time... Though the implications of this explanation are grim beyond reckoning, none of your companions seem ready to admit defeat just yet. Trouble Wedge for his thoughts on your predicament.</target>
