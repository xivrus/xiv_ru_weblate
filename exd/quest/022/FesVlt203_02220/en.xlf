Lady Lisette berates him for keeping her waiting for so long, and after a bit of prodding, Hortefense reveals the reason for his despair. He confesses that the truth revealed by the fortune-teller was one of the most unfavorable that she had ever delivered, causing Hortefense to flee the Aftcastle on the verge of tears. It is then that Lady Lisette reveals her manservant's mistake, stating that the only recourse is to visit the fortune-teller once again with the correct information. She returns to the Aftcastle, leaving you and Hortefense behind. He expresses his apprehension at the possibility of receiving yet another inauspicious reading, and asks that you attend them as House Valentione's ambassador of ardor and affection. Follow the star-crossed couple to the Aftcastle and observe the fateful augury.</target>

With the correct information at her disposal, the fortune-teller divines the romantic fate of House Valentione's two servants. The fortune-teller reveals that Lady Lisette and Hortefense are more compatible in love than any other couple she has seen. Hortefense takes advantage of this rare moment to profess his true feelings to Lady Lisette, and asks her to join him in marriage. Lady Lisette, after overcoming her initial fluster, agrees to the union. Hortefense is overjoyed, and rushes back to attend to the Valentione's Day festivities with renewed vigor. Lisette de Valentione thanks you before setting off towards what is sure to be a future filled with ardor and affection.</target>
