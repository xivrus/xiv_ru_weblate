A lot of the equipment from the bygone era is still functional, and the Mogmenders decide to take full advantage of this opportunity. While many of the moogles rejoice, immediately setting about their tasks, Mogek is worried that the streak of bad luck they have recently faced may continue, and would like for you to make sure they stay out of trouble.

Now short on items used to put the finishing touches on their tiles, he bids you craft a high-quality veneer component and deliver it to his assistant.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the mosaicist moogle.</target>
