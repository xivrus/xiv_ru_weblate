Mogek the Marvelous is gesturing for you to come over.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG301_02298_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Mogek learns from Whei Ahf that the Monsterie ruins were also once the center of production for the former Zenith plaza. A lot of the equipment from the bygone era is still functional, and the Mogmenders decide to take full advantage of this opportunity. While many of the moogles rejoice, immediately setting about their tasks, Mogek is worried that the streak of bad luck they have recently faced may continue, and would like for you to make sure they stay out of trouble.
