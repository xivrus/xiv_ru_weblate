        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA405_02270_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Adventurers' Guild must send pelts to the Convictory, but the Vath are not familiar enough with Coerthan climates to accurately judge which furs are best suited to such extreme temperatures. To prevent any mistakes, the Vath keeneye asks Grimold to take charge of this venture and requests that you go and provide assistance. Make your way to Tailfeather and speak with Grimold.

Knowing you would have had little trouble dispatching a lone drone, he is more relieved that he did not make the mistake of sending his brethren to assist Grimold. He is convinced they would have found the succulent meat far too difficult to resist.</target>
