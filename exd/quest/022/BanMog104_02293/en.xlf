While he awaits the first of these shipments, Mogek asks that you go and investigate the reason why the baskets have yet to turn up. Travel to the Sohm Al summit and speak with one of the basket-weaving moogles.

He requests you to synthesize a few basic basket components, which will serve to accelerate the pace at which the weavers can construct baskets. Once you are finished, he asks that you see they are delivered to the managing moogle.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the mendicant moogle.</target>
