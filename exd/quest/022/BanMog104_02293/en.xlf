While he awaits the first of these shipments, Mogek asks that you go and investigate the reason why the baskets have yet to turn up. Travel to the Sohm Al summit and speak with one of the basket-weaving moogles.

Once you are finished, he asks that you see they are delivered to the managing moogle.
