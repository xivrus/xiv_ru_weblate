The moogle he sent to gather them, however, is taking longer than expected. Though the delay is likely a trivial matter, Mogek will leave nothing to chance, and so he asks you to check on his underling in Sohm Al.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

He asks if you can help repair it, lest he anger the Mogmenders for delaying their plans. Once completed, he asks that you take the replacement parts to his moogle companion nearby.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the mournful moogle.</target>
