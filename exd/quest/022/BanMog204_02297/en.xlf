        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG204_02297_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Mogmenders have been giving it their all and more to restore Bahrr Lehs. What happens then should the moogles work themselves to exhaustion? The answer, Mogek tells you, is cloud mallows. A sprinkle of mallow puffs is all it takes to revitalize even the weariest of moogles. With many of the Mogmenders now neglecting their duties, he asks you to use one and puff new life into these worn out workers.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

※Speak with the moofy moogle in Bahrr Lehs to mount a cloud mallow.</target>

With a few well-timed wiggles atop the cloud mallow, the air is soon filled with puffs of its energizing seeds. The air soon clears and you find the moogles have rebounded with newfound strength. They bolt off to continue working without so much as acknowledging your presence. Head to the Rookery and see if anymore Mogmenders need a boost in their spirits.</target>
