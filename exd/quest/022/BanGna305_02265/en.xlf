        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA305_02265_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The hunters of Tailfeather have requested a particular set of goods found only within Loth ast Gnath. Unable to sneak past their heightened security, the Vath keeneye asks you to raid the enemy settlement in his stead. Your goal is to procure three jars of a special paste and three bags of blackloam.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA305_02265_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The Vath keeneye is pleased to see you return safely. As you hand over the spoils taken from the Gnath stronghold, you cannot help but notice his quizzical expression. He tells you these items are a special food reserved for soldiers of the Onemind, which is why he is so puzzled by the hunters' plans. The paste, he says, will be used for rearing chocobos. Though admittedly strange by his standards, this is a reasonable use for such nutritious food. However, he seems more perplexed by their intended use of the blackloam, which the hunters refer to as manure...</target>

No, only the Gnath colony has what they seek. Please, you must sneak into the colony and take them for us. Three bags of each should be all we require.</target>

We find it strange the hunters will use this for planting gysahl greens, rather than eating. Fleshlings call it by another name. Manure, was it...? &lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt;</target>
