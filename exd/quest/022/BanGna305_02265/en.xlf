Unable to sneak past their heightened security, the Vath keeneye asks you to raid the enemy settlement in his stead. Your goal is to procure three jars of a special paste and three bags of blackloam.

As you hand over the spoils taken from the Gnath stronghold, you cannot help but notice his quizzical expression. He tells you these items are a special food reserved for soldiers of the Onemind, which is why he is so puzzled by the hunters' plans. The paste, he says, will be used for rearing chocobos. Though admittedly strange by his standards, this is a reasonable use for such nutritious food. However, he seems more perplexed by their intended use of the blackloam, which the hunters refer to as manure...</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA305_02265_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Obtain jars of paste.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA305_02265_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Obtain blackloam.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA305_02265_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Deliver the paste and blackloam to the Vath keeneye.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA305_02265_SEARCHER_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Thank goodness you are here. &lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; We have received a request from Tailfeather, and we fear only you can complete it.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA305_02265_SEARCHER_000_001&lt;tab&gt;They ask for special paste and loam, but these are not found in Loth ast Vath.
