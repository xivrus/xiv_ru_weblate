His delayed return, however, has left the Vath keeneye fearing the worst. He asks that you travel south toward the Dravanian hinterlands in search of the wayward Vath.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You find the Vath farwalker, but the reason for his delay is not what you feared. In truth, he was startled by the nearby wyverns and stumbled, knocking over his cart. Still fearful of wyverns nearby, he asks you to search the area for any unbroken cargo that he may complete his delivery.</target>

Though he can now finish his delivery, he still fears the scolding he is sure to receive upon returning. He recalls the reason you were sent, however, and devises a surprisingly deceptive plan to abate the Vath keeneye's anger. He asks you to tell the Vath keeneye that he was, in fact, assaulted by the Onemind, and that you saved him. He then sets off for Idyllshire, and suggests you think carefully about the story you will tell.</target>

As he tells it, there are Vath with links to the Onemind still strong enough to turn them back to the side of the Gnath. Though he worries his brothers may give in to the pull of their still-unbroken bonds, he believes that, with effort, they will one day be truly free.</target>
