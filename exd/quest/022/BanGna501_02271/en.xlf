His delayed return, however, has left the Vath keeneye fearing the worst. He asks that you travel south toward the Dravanian hinterlands in search of the wayward Vath.

Though he can now finish his delivery, he still fears the scolding he is sure to receive upon returning. He recalls the reason you were sent, however, and devises a surprisingly deceptive plan to abate the Vath keeneye's anger. He asks you to tell the Vath keeneye that he was, in fact, assaulted by the Onemind, and that you saved him. He then sets off for Idyllshire, and suggests you think carefully about the story you will tell.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="7" approved="yes"><source>7</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;You relay a fabricated story of the farwalker's rescue, and the Vath keeneye is glad to hear he is safe and sound. As he tells it, there are Vath with links to the Onemind still strong enough to turn them back to the side of the Gnath. Though he worries his brothers may give in to the pull of their still-unbroken bonds, he believes that, with effort, they will one day be truly free.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Search for the Vath farwalker.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Look for an unbroken Vath jug.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Deliver the jug to the Vath farwalker.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="27" approved="yes"><source>27</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_TODO_03&lt;tab&gt;Search for another unbroken Vath jug.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="28" approved="yes"><source>28</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_TODO_04&lt;tab&gt;Deliver the jug to the Vath farwalker.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="29" approved="yes"><source>29</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_TODO_05&lt;tab&gt;Report to the Vath keeneye.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA501_02271_SEARCHER_000_000&lt;tab&gt;He is late.
