Soon after, Eynzahr appears in his civilian attire and proceeds to apprise you of all that has occurred since you salvaged Mistbeard's coffer. In a bid to discourage treasure hunters and put the island's remoteness to use, he petitioned Admiral Merlwyb to reserve Hullbreaker for the training of Maelstrom recruits. However, Eynzahr confides that he thinks the Grand Company's finest could do with some exercise themselves, and beseeches you to play the role of sparring partner during a coming drill.

After a bemusing interlude involving the ladies of the Sanguine Sirens and the carnivorous pet of the Kraken's Arms, the drill appears to be brought back on course as you spar with the Maelstrom's elite forces. Having defeated the Grand Company's finest, you find yourself in the presence of the Admiral, who came to witness the duel with your final opponent─Eynzahr Slafyrsyn himself. Though the storm marshal had originally intended to face you as an officer of the Maelstrom, at Merlwyb's prompting, he dons the mask of the legendary Mistbeard before engaging you in earnest.

When Denston subsequently expresses puzzlement at the pirates' role in proceedings, Eynzahr explains that they invited themselves in their capacity as the Maelstrom's “Black Sails” unit. Hearing this, the young man teases Eynzahr that he only permitted them to intervene out of curiosity to see if the old sea dogs could still hold their own in a fight. No sooner have the words left his lips than he notices Eynzahr's bruises, and realizes that he too participated. Visibly embarrassed, the storm marshal stiffly thanks you for taking part in the drill and excuses himself, leaving Denston to lament his commanding officer's advancing years. Though it is questionable if losing to you could be considered a sign of infirmity, you cannot help wondering how formidable Eynzahr must have been in his heyday...","TEXT_HEAVNY102_02248_SEQ_04<tab>デンストンに訓練を終えたことを伝えた。「ハルブレーカー島」での訓練に海賊たちが参加していたのは、冒険者を倒して名を高めるためだったようだ。大甲将の狙い通り、冒険者の存在が海賊部隊を訓練施設に向かわせたのだ。かつて荒海を暴れまわった大甲将は、冒険者に敗北したことによって、押し寄せる年波を痛感し、冒険者への期待と信頼を一層強めたようだ。","","False","0x00000004","",""
