Muscles aching, you head back to Bigwest Shortstop only to find that Mide has returned, presumably unaware of what has transpired in her absence. Corner the treasure hunter and demand the truth.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNR202_02250_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;In the end, Mide confesses the truth to you with little prompting, readily admitting that she had planned to use both you and the Illuminati to summon the primal. She is not so brazen, however, as to deny you an explanation. She duly relates the events of three years past, when she and several companions set out to summon Alexander and realize the perfect world described in the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enigma Codex&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. When their summoning subsequently failed, her companions were killed, and their leader absorbed into the primal's core.

Her tale told, Mide reveals at last that her true motive for attempting to revive the metal colossus was to meet once more with the man she loved. Furthermore, she tells you the two things required for complete control over Alexander: a complete &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enigma Codex&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, and someone with the ability to read it. Although the codex no longer responds to Mide, Roundrox is somehow able to view its contents, making her participation essential for any who hope to manipulate the primal. Unfortunately, it seems the Illuminati may already have reached the same conclusion, for no sooner has Mide uttered the words than a breathless Wedge barges into your midst bearing terrible news: Roundrox has been captured.</target>
