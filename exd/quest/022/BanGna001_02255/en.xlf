        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA001_02255_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The storyteller explains that Loth ast Vath has a newcomer, who has yet to find his purpose and thus remains nameless. Determined to make himself useful, the new Vath set out towards the Chocobo Forest in search of food to bring back to his brothers and sisters; alas, he has not yet returned. Worrying that the hunters may have mistaken him for a Gnath, the storyteller urges you to venture out to Tailfeather and inquire as to his whereabouts.

While pleased with the gysahl greens he has brought, the storyteller and the fleetfoot are troubled by their colony's sustainability. Though their link with the Overmind has been severed, they continue to depend on the Onemind by stealing what little resources they can from Loth ast Gnath.
