        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNC108_02238_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Change, however well intentioned, is often met with resistance. With resignation and pride both, Ser Aymeric admits that Ishgard is a nation built on centuries of warfare. To pursue peace in denial of this history is a doomed venture; rather, the people must be encouraged to embrace their identity, and take pride in one another's achievements, that they might be moved to common purpose. Happily, they will not want for suitable encouragement. The other members of the Eorzean Alliance have recently proposed joint military exercises, which Ser Aymeric believes could be presented as a “grand melee” to the public. Should Ishgard's forces triumph over those of the other city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;states, it would doubtless do much to restore the nation's morale. Lord Edmont acknowledges that there is merit to the lord commander's plan, and his only request is that his younger son take part in the melee, that he might make amends for his mistakes in Falcon's Nest. Though Ser Aymeric agrees in principle, he remains to be convinced that Emmanellain's wishes are in alignment with those of his lord father.</target>

As Ser Aymeric's grand scheme calls for a diverse force of Ishgardians to take the field, he departs to seek Hilda's opinion on the subject, leaving you to speak with Lucia alone.</target>

Doubtless, as a Garlean citizen, she bore witness to similar spectacles intended to rally the people to the imperial cause─for weal or for woe. Nevertheless, out of loyalty to Ser Aymeric, she sets about selecting candidates from both the Temple Knights and the watch, preparing a list of the latter to be delivered to Hilda.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNC108_02238_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;Born into privilege, Lord Emmanellain has never known true freedom. Like his brothers, his path in life was decided from birth. Yet as the old order crumbles and many are forced to choose a new path, he finds himself bewildered and lost. Terrified of making the wrong choice, he has let his father and brother order him about. To refrain from choosing is nevertheless a choice, however, and with regret he now sees what his indecision has wrought. Though his father may have had good reason to volunteer him for the melee, he cannot simply accept his command, and resolves to speak with Ser Aymeric himself, that for once he might make his own decision.</target>

In Ser Aymeric, Lord Emmanellain sees a man with unwavering conviction and faith, possessed of an almost supernatural strength. So inspired, he begs leave to participate in the grand melee, with a humility so unexpected that even Lord Edmont cannot contain his surprise. Ser Aymeric accepts, and the Ishgardian force is complete, save for a singular individual whom the lord commander would personally invite to join the fray: you. After a moment's introspection, you agree to fight for Ishgard, and a jubilant Ser Aymeric declares that you shall give the people a spectacle for the ages.</target>
