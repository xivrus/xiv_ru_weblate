After many tireless hours of trial and error, he has finally found the answer to their quandary; however, all these experiments have left him with no components to make more of his new blend. He asks that you go and gather some of these items and bring them back to him. Travel to Avalonia Fallen and the Smoldering Wastes to collect three branches of deadwood and three sacks of redsand.
