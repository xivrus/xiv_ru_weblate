        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA401_02266_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Convictors have been searching for a more potent firesand to power their newest cannons, and the Vath keeneye has taken it upon himself to solve their problem. After many tireless hours of trial and error, he has finally found the answer to their quandary; however, all these experiments have left him with no components to make more of his new blend. He asks that you go and gather some of these items and bring them back to him. Travel to Avalonia Fallen and the Smoldering Wastes to collect three branches of deadwood and three sacks of redsand.
