				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESNYR201_02217_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The saru bugyo, part of a Far Eastern delegation come to Eorzea, is attempting to infuse this year's Heavensturn with the good fortune of the monkey. His plan to have Jiromaru distribute rice cakes to the masses and thus improve relations between man and blessed beast, however, has encountered cyclopean-sized difficulties. Retrieve the advent cakes necessary to continue the festivities by participating in the FATE “Pounding Rice, Pounding Hearts” at one of the following locations: southeast of the Zephyr Gate in middle La Noscea; east of the Salt Strand in lower La Noscea; southeast of Bentbranch Meadows in the Central Shroud; south of Hyrstmill in the North Shroud; southeast of the Ul'dah Dispatch Yard in central Thanalan; and east of Camp Drybone in eastern Thanalan.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
