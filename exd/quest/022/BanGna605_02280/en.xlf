        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA605_02280_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Mourn has been overrun by pesky dinosaurs, and the Adventurers' Guild is asked to find a way to reduce their numbers. Deciding it to be the safest course of action, the Vath keeneye sends the Vath braveheart to steal their eggs. What was to be a quick job has resulted in the braveheart disappearing for days and now the keeneye needs someone to find─and possibly rescue─his friend. Travel to the caverns of Mourn and look for the braveheart.
