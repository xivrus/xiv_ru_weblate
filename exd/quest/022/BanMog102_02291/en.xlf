        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG102_02291_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Despite Mogek's attempts to dissuade him, one of his Mogmenders is convinced that searching the House of Letters will yield the construction materials they have long been eager to strike off of their ever-growing list of necessary items. However, days have passed since he set out on his own for the ruins, and Mogek begins to worry for the moogle's safety. He bids you make your way to the House of Letters and seek out the stubborn moogle.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG102_02291_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You come across a moogle who is so immersed in his work he does not notice you approach. Startled by your sudden appearance, he quickly recovers and goes on to explain that he is disappointed by the overall quality of the materials he has unearthed from the House of Letters. Knowing Mogek will not be satisfied by what he has gathered, he begs you to use your superior crafting skills to repurpose the  materials he has found into construction components and deliver them to Mogek the Marvelous.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the mettlesome moogle.</target>

He decides he will begin sending Mogmenders to thoroughly scour the area for materials in the near future.</target>
