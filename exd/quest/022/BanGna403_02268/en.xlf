Overwhelmed by the amount he has been asked to produce, he turns to you for assistance. Make your way to the Chocobo Forest and gather three ripe caelumtree fruits.

The Convictor is in a desperate hurry to get his wine, but unfortunately for him, it is far from ready. The clever Vath somehow foresaw this would happen, and produces a bottle from his reserve.

He leaves the Vath sanctuary with a spring in his step and blissfully unaware of the rather dubious additives which have been sprinkled into his wine.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA403_02268_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Obtain caelumtree fruit.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA403_02268_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Deliver the fruit to the Vath keeneye.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA403_02268_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Deliver the caelumtree wine to the Convictor knight.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA403_02268_SEARCHER_000_000&lt;tab&gt;How strange, you fleshlings.
