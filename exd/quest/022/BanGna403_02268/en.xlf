        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA403_02268_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Despite finding the concept of drinking alcohol to be extremely unappealing, the Vath keeneye turns out to be a dab hand at making wines, and his home-brew causes quite a stir over at the Convictory. Overwhelmed by the amount he has been asked to produce, he turns to you for assistance. Make your way to the Chocobo Forest and gather three ripe caelumtree fruits.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA403_02268_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You deliver the ripe caelumtree fruits to the Vath keeneye who sets to work, just as a knight from the Convictory appears at the Vath sanctuary. The Convictor is in a desperate hurry to get his wine, but unfortunately for him, it is far from ready. The clever Vath somehow foresaw this would happen, and produces a bottle from his reserve. He asks that you hand it to the restless knight, in hopes that it will tide him over until the new batch of wine is ready.</target>

He is eager to know what gives the wine its full flavor, but before you can disclose any details, he comes to the conclusion that only the best of ingredients could make such a fine drink. He leaves the Vath sanctuary with a spring in his step and blissfully unaware of the rather dubious additives which have been sprinkled into his wine.</target>

It's glaringly obvious something this good can only be crafted with the finest of ingredients!</target>
