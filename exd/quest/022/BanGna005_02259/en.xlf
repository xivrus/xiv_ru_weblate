Having faith in the strength of his individuality, the Vath adventurer intends to willingly submit himself to the Gnath to enter their colony. Once the Overmind is lured out to claim him, he would fell the king-like Gnath, ending his threat to the Vath. The deftarm tries to reassure himself of his cause before saying farewell to you and setting off for Loth ast Gnath.

The fleetfoot also reveals that the Overmind cannot truly be killed, for where one dies, another soon appears.

The Overmind claims triumphantly that the Vath adventurer's individuality has been removed and he has taken his place among the Onemind once more. After berating mankind for their thirst of war and discord, the Overmind hisses at you to leave his domain. He uses his power over the deftarm to raise his musket toward you, but you stand firm, trusting in your pupil's power. The storyteller soon arrives with the allies the deftarm has gathered over the course of his travels, and they attempt to call out to him. Their voices soon reach him, and the Overmind senses the imminent threat posed by the deftarm's overwhelming sense of self. Shocked beyond comprehension upon losing power over his thralls and the deftarm's assault, the Overmind soon retreats to the recesses of its lair.

The deftarm is grateful to you for taking him under your wing to guide him in the ways of adventuring, but assures you he is ready to stand on his own.
