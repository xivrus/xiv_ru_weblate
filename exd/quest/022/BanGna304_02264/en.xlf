				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANGNA304_02264_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Relations between the Vath and hunters of Tailfeather are improving by the day. However, a recent rash of animal attacks have hindered travel and trade between their two settlements. The Vath keeneye, eager to preserve their burgeoning friendship, asks you to survey the area and slay the beasts that plague travelers in the forest.

He confesses they received this request some time ago. Upon hearing there were bears, however, they decided it best to wait for a hunter─one such as yourself─to handle the job. He hopes someday the Vath will muster the courage to undertake these more daunting requests.</target>
