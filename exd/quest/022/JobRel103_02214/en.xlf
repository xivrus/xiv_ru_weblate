        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL103_02214_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The anima has grown at a rattling pace, absorbing large amounts of aether in the process. Ardashir fears this rapid development may exceed the limits of the soulstone serving as its base. To ensure all your hard work is not wasted, he plans to fortify the soulstone, as well as have Gerolt forge a new weapon to hold it. This new weapon, however, will require four materials essential for conducting large quantities of aether: enchanted rubber, fast-drying carboncoat, fast-acting Allagan catalyst, and divine water. Gerolt suggests seeking out a merchant named Cristiana at the House of Splendors in Mor Dhona who may have what he requires.

She demands several expertly exotic goods in exchange for the materials Gerolt asked for. Whether you fashion them, find them, or trade for them, you must acquire what Gerolt needs if you are to complete the anima weapon.</target>
