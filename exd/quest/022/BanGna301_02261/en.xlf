        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA301_02261_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Not long ago, hunters from Tailfeather put in a request for melia branches, a pliable wood perfect for making arrows. The Vath keeneye asks that you venture out into the Smoldering Wastes in his stead. Marking your map with three locations known to be melia budding grounds, he asks that you slay any meliae you find and collect their branches.

Nevertheless, you can do no more than what was asked of you. Return to Loth ast Vath and deliver what melia branches you found.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA301_02261_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The Vath keeneye is more than happy with the branches you provide him. As an aside, he tells you of his offer of nanka eggs to the hunters of Tailfeather, in addition to the branches they requested. Though his intentions were pure, he was surprised at the hunters' reaction. It would seem the Vath keeneye has much to learn of the likes and dislikes of other races. </target>

Three places, three chances to find melia branches. &lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; If you see them, defeat them quickly, then bring back what you find.</target>

One would be plenty, but with two the fleshlings will be very pleased.

A very tasty treat. &lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; We offered them to the hunters, but they say our eggs are putrid. Such strange fleshlings they are. Yes, very strange.</target>
