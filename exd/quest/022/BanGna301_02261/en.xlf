The Vath keeneye asks that you venture out into the Smoldering Wastes in his stead. Marking your map with three locations known to be melia budding grounds, he asks that you slay any meliae you find and collect their branches.

As an aside, he tells you of his offer of nanka eggs to the hunters of Tailfeather, in addition to the branches they requested. Though his intentions were pure, he was surprised at the hunters' reaction. It would seem the Vath keeneye has much to learn of the likes and dislikes of other races. </target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA301_02261_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Survey the designated spots and slay meliae for their branches.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA301_02261_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Deliver the melia branches to the Vath keeneye.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA301_02261_SEARCHER_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Well come, great hunter.

One would be plenty, but with two the fleshlings will be very pleased.

Now meliae have value thanks to the hunters. </target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="54" approved="yes"><source>54</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA301_02261_SEARCHER_000_013&lt;tab&gt;For the Vath, nanka eggs always have great value. They are a delicacy. A very tasty treat. &lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; We offered them to the hunters, but they say our eggs are putrid. Such strange fleshlings they are. Yes, very strange.</target></trans-unit></body></file></xliff>
