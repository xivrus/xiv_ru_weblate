Although the codex no longer responds to Mide, Roundrox is somehow able to view its contents, making her participation essential for any who hope to manipulate the primal.

Sie war tatsächlich Teil der Au Ra-Forschergruppe, die vor drei Jahren Alexander zu beschwören versuchte, um die ideale Heimat zu verwirklichen, die der Enigma-Kodex beschreibt. Dabei kamen ihre Kameraden ums Leben und Mides Geliebter wurde vom Kern Alexanders aufgesaugt, bevor sie den Kodex zerschmettern und den Primae bannen konnte. Mide ist überzeugt, dass die Seele ihres Geliebten noch immer im Inneren von Alexander gefangen ist. Deshalb hatte sie die Indigohand zu einer neuen Beschwörung angestiftet, um ihn wiederauferstehen zu lassen und mit ihm vereint zu sein. Zur Beschwörung reicht es aus, sämtliche Fragmente des Enigma-Kodex zu besitzen, doch um Alexander zu kontrollieren, braucht es auch jemanden, der in der Lage ist, den Kodex zu „lesen“ ...
