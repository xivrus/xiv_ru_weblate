Fortunately, their cries serve to draw the attention of Cyr and Godbert, and the latter states with confidence that he has ways of waking his son. Summoning his strength, he rips Hildibrand free, soaring high into the sky before slamming him even deeper into the snow. After taking a moment to reflect on the silliness of naming one's attacks, he once more pulls his son free with a mighty suplex. Rising to his feet, a bewildered Hildibrand quickly takes stock of the situation and poses for his fans. Yet soon all eyes are upon the mammet which was disgorged from the ground along with him─seemingly broken, but soon brought to life with a few deft whacks of Godbert's hammer.</target>

Seeing this, Inspector Hildibrand attempts to comfort the poor creation, even going so far as to give it a new name: Gigi (which Inquisitor Cyr is quick to decry as a name no one in their right mind would ever give a mammet). The inspector resolves to help Gigi recover its memories, and they depart for Ishgard along with Nashu. Satisfied that Hildibrand is alive and well, the Gentle Dead Man and Godbert take their leave and set forth for Thanalan. Once more you find yourself left alone with Inquisitor Cyr, who has yet to come to terms with this strange new world he has found himself within, one devoid of reason and logic. Shaking his head, he mutters that Inspector Hildibrand will still need to be cleared of all suspicion before he will be permitted to travel freely in Ishgard. And so you two begin your trek back to the capital as well...</target>
