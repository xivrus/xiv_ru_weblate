Your story moves the inspiration-starved bard to song, and he delivers a reasonably faithful retelling of your toils and triumphs within Alexander. The experience fills you with a desire to discuss the battles of your past with someone familiar. Walk along the banks of the Thaliak River and reminisce on your adventures with Lightkix.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNR291_02254_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;For reasons you cannot well explain, it would seem you are now able to relive your foray into Midas.

A path for our weariless hero to make,♪
And thus did &lt;var 08 E905 ((she)) ((he)) /var&gt; aim for the beast's second heart,♪
Cleaving both it and its keepers apart.♪</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="55" approved="yes"><source>55</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNR291_02254_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_006&lt;tab&gt;Yet in spite of &lt;var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var&gt; triumph, the goblins all laughed,♪
And by means lost to meaning, in victory basked.♪
Yea, the giant of steel was far more than it seemed,♪
With power beyond knowing, potential ungleaned.♪
And thus was our hero compelled to withdraw,♪
Resolved to return and do battle once more.♪</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="56" approved="yes"><source>56</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNR291_02254_WANDERINGMINSTREL_000_007&lt;tab&gt;There!
