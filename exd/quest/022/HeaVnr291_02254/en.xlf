Your story moves the inspiration-starved bard to song, and he delivers a reasonably faithful retelling of your toils and triumphs within Alexander. The experience fills you with a desire to discuss the battles of your past with someone familiar. Walk along the banks of the Thaliak River and reminisce on your adventures with Lightkix.</target>

Peer into the past, knowing that considered retrospection can often grant valuable insight into the present─and occasionally more tangible rewards.

※Midas (Savage) can be accessed by speaking with Lightkix in the Dravanian hinterlands, as well as via the Raid Finder.</target>

Through sunrise and sunset, intruders to foil,♪
Till the limb of their lodging did chance to awake,♪
A path for our weariless hero to make,♪
And thus did &lt;var 08 E905 ((she)) ((he)) /var&gt; aim for the beast's second heart,♪
Cleaving both it and its keepers apart.♪</target>

And by means lost to meaning, in victory basked.♪
Yea, the giant of steel was far more than it seemed,♪
With power beyond knowing, potential ungleaned.♪
And thus was our hero compelled to withdraw,♪
Resolved to return and do battle once more.♪</target>
