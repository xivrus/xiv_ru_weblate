Sales have continued to soar and to prevent exhausting their limited supply, the Vath have begun cultivating their own. While their fields have grown thick with these herbs, most of their plants do not have as potent a smell as those found in the wild. Sending an inferior product to their customers would tarnish the guild's good name, so it is decided each bundle must pass a test. The Vath keeneye hands you a bunch of these herbs and asks that you help them evaluate the quality of their plants. Take the silver dew and speak with the Vath kintamer.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA404_02269_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The Vath kintamer mumbles and grumbles about the current state of their crops as he helps you climb onto a kongamato and load it with your silver dew. While he is clearly distraught, he seems hopeful that you will bring back good news. Now that you are securely mounted, fly to the Smoldering Wastes and find a dragon to test your dew on.

※Simply by speaking with the Vath kintamer you will be able to mount the kongamato.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA404_02269_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The wyvern is disgusted by the silver dew and hurries to escape, but your job is still far from over.
