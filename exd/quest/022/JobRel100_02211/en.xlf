        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You happen upon Rowena just as two unexpected visitors arrive. The first is an earnest young researcher bearing an urgent request, the second, Gerolt the ale-sodden blacksmith. Wasting no time, the researcher, one Ardashir, declares that he has been conducting research into the creation of artificial life─something he refers to as “anima.” Though all of his trials have thus far ended in failure, he is convinced that the Sharlayans' work on arcane sentries holds the key to success. Before he can continue with his suit, however, Gerolt decries him for his lack of imagination, and wryly suggests fusing the anima with a weapon─a proposal which Ardashir considers a stroke of genius. Never one to miss a chance to turn a profit, Rowena sets about persuading Gerolt to take part in the venture, and before you know it, you too have been roped in to test the finished product. You are to rendezvous with Ardashir and Gerolt in Azys Lla, where the pair will apparently be working.</target>
