With the prompting of a passing little helper, the goldsmith decides to have you request a famous composer to modify the Ishgardian soldiers' tune into a more celebratory arrangement.

As you wonder what will become of the festival, you are paid an unexpected visit by a white-bearded man dressed as the Saint of Nymeia. The saint offers to work a seasonal miracle upon the bell, and, after a few moments of metalworking ministrations, hands the newly gleaming instrument back to Cahernaut. The composer, inspired by this display of goldsmithing prowess, soon has the bell's old song arranged into an enchanting melody.
