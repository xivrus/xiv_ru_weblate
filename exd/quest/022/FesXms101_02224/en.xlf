He asks that you speak with Hervey, the Adventurers' Guild's best goldsmith, and see how the repairs are progressing. Seek out the artisan near the Ruby Road Exchange in Ul'dah.</target>

It seems that the clapper has rusted through, and the goldsmith laments that he has not the skills to forge a new one. Acquire a new iron clapper for the signal bell, then return to Hervey with the replacement part.

The melody he produces from the repaired bell, however, is not as festive as he had hoped. With the prompting of a passing little helper, the goldsmith decides to have you request a famous composer to modify the Ishgardian soldiers' tune into a more celebratory arrangement. Make your way to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre in Gridania, and present the signal bell and its accompanying sheet music to Cahernaut.</target>

As you wonder what will become of the festival, you are paid an unexpected visit by a white-bearded man dressed as the Saint of Nymeia. The saint offers to work a seasonal miracle upon the bell, and, after a few moments of metalworking ministrations, hands the newly gleaming instrument back to Cahernaut. The composer, inspired by this display of goldsmithing prowess, soon has the bell's old song arranged into an enchanting melody. Return to Limsa Lominsa, and deliver the Starlight bell─and its rearranged sheet music─to Baenfaeld in East Hawkers' Alley.</target>
