        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA502_02272_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The goblins of Idyllshire have an insatiable appetite for nanka eggs. So much so, the Vath keeneye explains, that they travel to the forelands in search of more in spite of constant deliveries from the Vath. Always near the river, the goblins are now beleaguered by swarms of insects. They refuse to leave, however, asking for the Vath's repellent so they may continue foraging. Speak with the Vath kintamer and prepare for a trip to the Whilom River.
