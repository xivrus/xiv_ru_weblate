After hearing the tale of your expedition, the Padjals speculate that the animated statues you encountered may have begun to stir when darkness last took hold within the ruins. And when the elementals subsequently entered the city, the Amdapori sentinels likely perceived the purely aetherial beings as voidsent invaders of the kind often employed by the city of Mhach. The incident thus explained, and the defenses safely disabled, the Padjals may now resume the task of returning the ancient city to the embrace of the forest.</target>
