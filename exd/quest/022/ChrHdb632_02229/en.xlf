Struck by a sudden epiphany, Nashu speculates that Gigi may have wandered out into the wastes in search of his “grandpapa,” Lord Godbert, of whose crafting prowess she and Hildibrand spoke so highly. Alas, even should they have correctly discerned the mammet's intent, the western highlands are vast, and the odds of him stumbling upon the goldsmith and his wife are rather slim...</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CHRHDB632_02229_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;To your great relief, Gigi soon rises to his feet, apparently none the worse for wear. Hildibrand is overjoyed to be reunited with his errant son, and Godbert with his. Before you or anyone else can explain the situation, however, Gigi beseeches his grandfather to use his peerless skills to transform his body into that of a real boy. So enjoined, the goldsmith prepares his tools, and in a dazzling display of acrobatic craftsmanship molds the mammet's tiny frame into that of a towering Roegadyn. The jubilant Gigi then runs to his father, arms outstretched, only to accidentally deal him a bone-crunching blow, driving Hildibrand into the ground in an explosion of dirt and snow.

Alas, Gigi's joy is short-lived, not through any ill-feeling at his well-intentioned assault, but because of the magicks which soon envelop his body, restoring it to its original shape, and depriving him of that which he so desperately desired. Once more, the mammet seems poised to fall into despair, when Hildibrand, freshly extricated from the earth, reassures him that their bonds transcend flesh and blood and steel─that even if he is not a man, he is still a Manderville mammet. Yet while this sentiment brings Gigi and his Grandpapa Godbert much joy, Lady Julyan is of another mind, as evidenced by her brandishing of a skillet large enough to bludgeon a god to death. The sight of this prompts Hildibrand and Lord Godbert to depart with all haste, followed by Nashu and Gigi, and finally the Lady Julyan, still incandescent with rage, leaving you alone with a cowering Cyr.</target>

Though he has failed in everything he set out to achieve, he takes solace in the fact that Gigi was able to overcome his personal crisis...before berating himself for appearing to care about the feelings of a mammet. He duly departs for the city to inform his superiors of recent events, as ridiculous and unproductive as they proved to be.</target>
