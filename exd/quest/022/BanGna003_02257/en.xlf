        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA003_02257_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Vath deftarm is pleased with the progress his guild is making, but with progress comes the need for more tools and weapons. He notes that the muskets that the Nonmind have stolen from the Gnath are falling into disrepair, and he seeks a way to procure more without relying on their enemy. The Vath inquires to you about the goblins, who he heard were quite adept at metalworking. Seeking your help for an introduction to the goblins of Idyllshire, he excitedly sets off to prepare for his new journey. You agree to rendezvous at the border, in the west of Avalonia Fallen.
