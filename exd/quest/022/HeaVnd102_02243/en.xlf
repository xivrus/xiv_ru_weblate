Now that Nidhogg is possessed of both of his eyes, the lord commander believes that there is only one being capable of standing against the vengeful shade─Nidhogg's own brood-brother, Hraesvelgr. As such, he would have you escort him to Zenith, and aid him in convincing the great wyrm to stand with Ishgard. Though Alphinaud harbors understandable doubts as to the wisdom of this course, it is plain that Ser Aymeric will not be swayed. Notify the lord commander when you are ready to depart.</target>
