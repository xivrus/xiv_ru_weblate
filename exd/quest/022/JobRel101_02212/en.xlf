All the necessary elements are in place save two: astral and umbral nodules, the catalysts required to facilitate the process of channeling aether into the soulstone. Unsure of where to procure them, Ardashir suggests speaking with Rowena in Revenant's Toll. With any luck, she will know of a merchant who can provide what he needs.

When you inquire about the nodules, she is taken aback by your outlandish request, but is not deterred from the challenge of producing what you seek. The process will require elementally aspected luminous crystals, and she insists you bring her one of every element. However, she also believes there may be one other way: bringing her a Zodiac Weapon of the highest order. Seeing your nonplussed expression, she concedes that such a legendary weapon may be no more than a rumor.

※Should you be unwilling or unable to offer a suitable Zodiac Weapon, luminous crystals can be obtained by participating in FATEs in the following regions:
- Sea of Clouds: luminous wind crystals
- Azys Lla: luminous fire crystals
- Churning Mists: luminous lightning crystals
- Coerthas western highlands: luminous ice crystals
