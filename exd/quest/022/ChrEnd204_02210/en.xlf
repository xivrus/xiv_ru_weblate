Seeing as he could show up any time to procure his standard selection of items from the carvery, the inspector urges you make haste and follow him to the Jeweled Crozier. Securing a secluded corner on the bustling street, the two of you keep an eye out for a scar-faced man swathed in silken robes.</target>
