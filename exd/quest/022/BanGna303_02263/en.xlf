				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANGNA303_02263_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;A crop of gysahl greens at Tailfeather has been besieged by insects, and the Vath keeneye is beside himself with worry. Luckily, the Vath have a potent insect repellent for just such an occasion. He asks that you make for Tailfeather with great haste to dispel these horrid pests. First, you must speak with the Vath kintamer to mount a kongamato equipped with vilekin repellent.

Unfortunately, a hunter─Louisonet─happened to be standing in the patch of greens when you did so. After regaining composure, he informs you that you have not sprayed the greens in their entirety. He asks that you aim more carefully when you tend to the remaining portion of the plot.</target>

He thanks you all the same, and asks that you make one more stop before returning to Loth ast Vath. These insects are quite persistent in their search for gysahl greens, and have gone so far as eating them from traps in the Chocobo Forest. He asks that you fumigate those greens as well before there is nothing left of their traps.</target>
