Convinced that she is being held somewhere close to the colossus's central section, Mide bids you continue your assault through its left arm, while she looks for a route through the right. Push further into Alexander's interior and search for the stricken child.

After a fierce battle, you succeed in destroying Quickthinx's flying machine, and he is forced to flee. Roundrox, however, is nowhere to be seen. With no clear onward path to follow, you have little choice but to return to Bigwest Shortstop and report your progress to Backrix.</target>

Before she can elaborate, however, the goblin calls her loyalty into question, accusing her of pursuing the aims of her fallen comrades. In a bid to assuage his doubts, she reveals her original motive for summoning Alexander, and reaffirms that her only wish is to meet once more with the man she loves. With Backrix seemingly placated, Mide turns to the matter of Roundrox's rescue. Reasoning that the child will be safe as long as Alexander remains immobile, she proposes disabling another of the three cores that power the primal. According to her information, the most accessible of these is situated in the left arm, not far from the scene of your battle with Quickthinx. She warns you, however, that the core is certain to be heavily guarded...</target>
