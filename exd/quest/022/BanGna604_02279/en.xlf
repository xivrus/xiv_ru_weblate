        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA604_02279_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Silver dew smoke hovers in a thick cloud draped about Anyx Trine, and the dragons inhabiting the tower believe the Vath to be the perpetrators of this heinous crime. The Vath, however, suspect the true source of this smoke to be the censers that have recently been appearing across Gnath territory. The Vath keeneye believes there to be four new censers, having counted four distinct wisps of smoke from a distance. Make your way to the Smoldering Wastes, disable the Gnath censers, and help the Vath clear the air.
