Godbert is surprised to find two of his beloved son's companions standing before him, but perhaps even more surprised when a young inquisitor named Cyr appears and accuses him of being a heretic. Annoyed, Lord Edmont immediately intervenes, prompting Cyr to rescind his accusation and explain that Godbert matches the description of a suspected heretic he has been tracking. Upon learning of your search for Inspector Hildibrand, the inquisitor proposes that you join forces and continue your search in Falcon's Nest, where the first reported sightings of Cyr's quarry originated, as it is possible that you seek the same man. If so─and if the inspector is innocent─it would behoove you to be present when he is apprehended.</target>

He states that the suspected heretic was sighted just south of the Dusk Vigil, but is also quick to add that they have no reason to presume the man was in fact a heretic. Nevertheless, Inquisitor Cyr is quick to proclaim that you have caught the “unmistakable scent of heresy”─all-too-familiar words which give you pause...</target>

Despairing that her search has literally met a dead end, Nashu sighs, but the zombie gentleman reassures her that all is not lost, for he claims to have the ability to track his beloved overlord via some manner of aetheric bond they share. As the others rush off, eager to find the inspector, you are left alone with Cyr, who is attempting to determine if zombification is a sickness which must be purged.</target>
