After rejecting Cait Sith's offer to join the Redbills in their quest to defeat the voidsent, Radlia leaves the tattered tome with Leofard. The Redbill captain immediately urges Cait Sith to learn more of the Mhachi relic in his possession, adamant that the freedom of the skies will be threatened no more...</target>
