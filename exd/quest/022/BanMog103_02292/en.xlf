To remedy the situation, Mogek has ordered two of their number to scavenge for wood and steel bars in the Landlord Colony and Eil Tohm. However, both have yet to return. Wanting to save time, he requests that you go and collect whatever they may have found and deliver it to the mindful moogle.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

Seeming to come across items which spark his interest, he stops abruptly, and hands them to you, asking that you use them to create basic building components for the foundation of the plaza.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the mindful moogle.</target>
