However, with their consignment now long overdue, Mogek's patience is wearing thin and, unable to contain his frustration, he bids you investigate the cause of this delay.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Upon entering the ruins, you are greeted by a moogle who expresses his relief that you're here. He goes on to explain that a number of his crew has been struck down, overwhelmed by the vast amounts of aether being emanated from the crystals around them. Believing he will be able to see their harvested crystals safely back to Mogek if he can shield the few remaining moogles from their adverse effects, he asks that you fashion an aetheric shielding for their chests. Synthesize the requested items and deliver them to the malaised moogle.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the muddled moogle.</target>

Upon handing him the shielding you synthesized, however, he perks up, a great deal more confident he can handle the situation.</target>
