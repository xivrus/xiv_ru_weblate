Mogek the Marvelous gazes at the sky, an exasperated sigh on his lips.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Tharl Oom Khash contains some of the purest crystals in the realm, and Mogek, eager to get a hold of some, has sent Mogmenders to procure several chestloads of these gleaming marvels. However, with their consignment now long overdue, Mogek's patience is wearing thin and, unable to contain his frustration, he bids you investigate the cause of this delay.

He goes on to explain that a number of his crew has been struck down, overwhelmed by the vast amounts of aether being emanated from the crystals around them. Believing he will be able to see their harvested crystals safely back to Mogek if he can shield the few remaining moogles from their adverse effects, he asks that you fashion an aetheric shielding for their chests. Synthesize the requested items and deliver them to the malaised moogle.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with the muddled moogle.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The moogle you hand the aetheric shielding to is beginning to feel dizzy─a telltale sign of aether sickness. He is concerned that if his condition worsens, he will be unable to deliver the crystals he promised Mogek. Upon handing him the shielding you synthesized, however, he perks up, a great deal more confident he can handle the situation.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANMOG302_02299_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Mogek the Marvelous feels responsible for the complications that arose in Tharl Oom Khash.
