The inspector is convinced that the recent hostilities are the result of a carefully laid plot conceived to further the interests of a party or parties unknown. Though he has yet to discover what their ultimate aim might be, he is not without a plan. Certain that the unexplained disappearances of Ulaa and volume eleven of the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Articles of Halonic Polity&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; are somehow related to the scheme, he declares his intent to find the missing girl by tracking down the missing book. While he continues to search for the tome, Briardien bids you inquire as to whether the students have heard anything concerning Ulaa's whereabouts or, failing that, observed any unusual goings-on.</target>

At your approach, the former rises to greet you, and reveals that Gorgagne Mills is the resting place of the boys' late mentor, Father Choisseau. He goes on to explain that the two of them often visit the grave when they are feeling lost or uncertain. Interpreting your unexpected arrival as a sign from on high, the two students seem satisfied that their time has been well spent, and resolve to return to the scholasticate forthwith.
