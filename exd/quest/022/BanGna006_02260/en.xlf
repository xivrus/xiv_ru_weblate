Many new Vath are inspired by the guild's humble beginnings, choosing their purpose as adventurers under the deftarm's tutelage. Admitting that he is no good with sentimentality, he asks you to visit the storyteller, who also wanted to speak with you.</target>

He observes that while the Overmind is well aware of the Vath's strength in allies and has been keeping tight guard over his subjects, there are always those who escape to the sanctuary, and he is eager to tell their story. The storyteller imparts upon you the Vath will not forget what you have done for them, and to ever consider yourself a part of the hive. </target>
