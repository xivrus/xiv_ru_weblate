        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA503_02273_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;After greeting you in a most unusual manner, the Vath keeneye tells you of yet another request from the goblins. As always, their appetite for nanka eggs is endless, and he would ask you help fill their most recent order. To lure out nankas heavy with eggs, he says you will need to retrieve bait from a trap set up north in the waters of the Hundred Throes.
