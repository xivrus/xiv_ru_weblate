        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA603_02278_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;One of the younglings of Anyx Trine has gone out to play but does not return, and an anxious mother dragon enlists the guild's services. While many Vath have been scouring the nearby lands to find this missing child, their latest encounter with a vicious monster has left all of them far too shaken up to press on in their search. The Vath keeneye turns to you once more, and asks that you look for the baby dragon in their stead.
