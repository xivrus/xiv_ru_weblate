        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNY212_02281_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Unukalhai gifts you an Allagan tomestone that supposedly contains a detailed record of the furious conflict between Sephirot and the forces of Allag. He proceeds to explain that the wondrous technology of the ancient empire will be able to use that information to manifest an artificial incarnation of the powerful eikon, allowing you to experience battle against the mighty Sephirot once more. Take the tomestone to the Flagship of Azys Lla, and present the recording device to the verification node.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNY212_02281_UNUKALHAI_000_002&lt;tab&gt;Should you present this tomestone to the verification node outside Triad Control, the node's systems will analyze the various aspects of the conflict and create for you a false eikon against which you can train. Consider it a sort of “mock battle” that presumes a Sephirot who has broken free of his shackles.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNY212_02281_UNUKALHAI_000_003&lt;tab&gt;If I understand its workings correctly, the node should also be capable of manifesting a far stronger incarnation of the eikon. This would mimic the catastrophic consequences were Sephirot ever to absorb an additional source of energy─say, by defeating another member of the Warring Triad. A compelling challenge for a warrior of your ability, yes?</target>
