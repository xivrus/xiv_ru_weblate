However, the cannons did not come with the stock of firesand required to operate them. Not to be discouraged by the Gnath's fierce guard of the sulphur needed to make the powder, the deftarm sought advice from Marcechamp. The hunter made mention of the Convictors of Coerthas, who own cannons similar to the deftarm's second-hand ones. The Vath adventurer concludes that the dragonslayers must have a large supply of firesand on hand, and is eager to make their acquaintance. Before making your way to Coerthas, rendezvous with the deftarm on the edge of the Chocobo Forest.
