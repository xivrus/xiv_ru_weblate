        <target state="final">TEXT_BANGNA002_02256_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The colony has used some of its newfound wealth to procure second-hand cannons for their defense. However, the cannons did not come with the stock of firesand required to operate them. Not to be discouraged by the Gnath's fierce guard of the sulphur needed to make the powder, the deftarm sought advice from Marcechamp. The hunter made mention of the Convictors of Coerthas, who own cannons similar to the deftarm's second-hand ones. The Vath adventurer concludes that the dragonslayers must have a large supply of firesand on hand, and is eager to make their acquaintance. Before making your way to Coerthas, rendezvous with the deftarm on the edge of the Chocobo Forest.

The fledgling adventurer makes the mistake of declaring he will perform “any task” in exchange, prompting Jantellot to bid the Vath rid the camp of lesser dragons entirely. After failing to convince Jantellot to change his request, the deftarm is at a loss as to how to slay a horde of dragons on his own. However, recalling the Vathic methods of driving dragons away, he quickly departs the camp to search for herbs to make incense, but not before asking that you prepare a fire outside the camp.</target>

Just as the scouts have spotted lesser dragons flying over the ridge towards the camp, the deftarm appears with the dried herbs. He tells Jantellot if he lights them aflame, it will produce a smoke so potent that it forces dragons to retreat. The Convictor seems doubtful of its effectiveness at first, but is pleasantly surprised when he sees the results for himself. He offers firesand to the deftarm in exchange for more of the herbs to which the deftarm gleefully accepts. With mention of the guild and its services, a deal is struck between the Vath and the Convictor leader. Speak with the deftarm before you set off for Loth ast Vath.</target>
