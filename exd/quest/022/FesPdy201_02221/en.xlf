        <target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY201_02221_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You stop when a news reporter from the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Mythril Eye&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; asks you for your candid opinion on the newly formed ensemble, the Songbirds, scheduled to perform at the coming Little Ladies' Day festival. Upon confessing your ignorance, he reveals that the group's rise to stardom hasn't been as smooth as was expected and that most of the realm remains unaware of their existence. Sensing your curiosity may be piqued, the reporter suggests you go and speak with the royal seneschal at the Ruby Road Exchange.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
