				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANGNA505_02275_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;A band of treasure hunters hoping to strike it rich have come from Idyllshire. Though they initially requested an escort, caution gave way to avarice, and they decided to depart unaided. The Vath keeneye fears for their safety, and so he asks you make for Anyx Trine to ensure they have not come to harm.

They claim to have been chased by dragons ever since arriving in Anyx Trine. No sooner do they finish speaking than a pair of hippocerfs appear, ready to attack. Thankfully you are there to dispatch them with relative ease. With the beasts slain, check that the hunters remain uninjured.</target>
