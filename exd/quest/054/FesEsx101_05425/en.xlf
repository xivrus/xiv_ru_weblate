        <target state="final">TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The stylish Dreamer is none other than Jihli Aliapoh, founder of the imminent Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide festivities. This year, Jihli's prophetic dream featured golden eggs that floated up from thick swathes of flora, prompting the creation of an egg hunt through the Black Shroud's foliage. Jihli's cohort, Nonotta, was charged with preparing the arena for participants, but enough time has passed without word of the proceedings for Jihli to become worried. She tasks you with finding Nonotta, who may have returned to Gridania.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESESX101_05425_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You find Nonotta in the aetheryte plaza, boasting an adorable pair of chicken sunglasses and no little consternation. Apparently, the arena the Dreamers thought to use for their egg hunt has been overrun by a plant so stubborn it cannot be trimmed or culled, leading Nonotta to believe the flora may be a variation of potentially dangerous leafkin. Accepting a piece of the peculiar plant, you head to the Carline Canopy to question visitors on their knowledge of its source, while Nonotta heads for the Botanists' Guild.</target>

Just as she expresses a wish to thank Herberin for his assistance in the matter, the alchemist in question comes tearing in, proclaiming a profound discovery. Not only has he managed to cure the injury inflicted upon his eyes by the very leafkin you just finished culling, but he claims great promise in its properties of regeneration. Alchemy as he knows it may be entering a golden age, and this, Jihli realizes, is the true meaning behind her dream, the golden eggs a representation of rising hopes for the future.

Thanks to your efforts, Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide festivities may now begin in earnest, but the egg arena may need a trim every now and again. Stop by for Sprig Cleaning whenever you have a moment, and enjoy the rest of these spring celebrations.</target>
