        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGWZ301_05450_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Seeing as you have time on your hands, Mumukko would ask a favor. During her investigation, Councilor Y'adebh documented two women at risk of working themselves into an early grave: Dylise and Justa. Naturally, the Forum has ordered the initiative rectify the matter posthaste, and issued two vicarious vacationers to aid in the enforcement of healthy habits. Your role is to see them into their charges' hands, and ensure that sufficient rest is taken as seriously as exciting advances in interstellar travel.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGWZ301_05450_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You find Dylise chatting with Commandingway as she awaits word from the Phaenna observation team. She insists that the Euhedron data analysis must necessarily take precedence above all─until a bout of dizziness causes her to lose her balance. When the mammet identifies heart palpitations and elevated blood pressure among her symptoms, Commandingway realizes that she has not adjourned to bed in several days. For her part, Dylise is quick to grasp how morale would suffer were she to collapse from exhaustion, and so she submits to the vacationer's instruction.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGWZ301_05450_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;When you approach Justa, her new mammet minder promptly observes aloud that she has been working for six bells uninterrupted. As Garlean soldiers were typically barred from rest until they fulfilled their duty, Justa seems surprised that Mumukko would take such pains to look out for her health, and admits that to do so will take more discipline than she is used to exercising. However, understanding that the betterment of her work style is key to her ability to transform technology into a boon to mankind, she vows to embrace the occasional break.</target>

Alas, this does not blunt Mumukko's wrath for the poor Loporrit, who is admittedly partially responsible for allowing so dire a situation to develop in the first place. To her mind, it is a manager's sacred duty to balance passionate progress with sustainable working conditions─for which purpose she intends to continue to deploy vicarious vacationers. Though it is difficult not to fear for those who might flaut her new zero-tolerance policy for excess work, either intentionally or through simple lack of attention to the clock, it should at least result in fewer mech-related accidents.</target>
