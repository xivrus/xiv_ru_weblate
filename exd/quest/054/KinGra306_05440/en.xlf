To leave that man─that monstrosity─unpunished for his crimes would be a crime in itself. And so you ready yourself to face the serpentine Lindwurm.

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGRA306_05440_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Just as Yaana demands the location of the Drop of Life, Metem steps forward to explain that it must be extracted from the Lindwurm's heart. With sorrow in his voice, he continues his explanation, but is cut short when the felled beast suddenly regenerates once more. Seeing this, Yaana abandons her regulator, inspired to fight the monster unenhanced after your example. Your retired comrades soon join to even the odds, and just when it seems their combined strength is not enough, who should appear but the presumed dead Brute Bomber. Beckoning them to channel their aether to him, the reviled heel then sends you a fiery infusion of energy. With everyone's strength behind you, you dropkick the Lindwurm and bring it down yet again. It is at this moment that the Tyrant and other heavyweights appear, and summarily end the tormented president's life. The Lindwurm's heart at last extracted, Metem vows to see every soul cured of the disease─Eutrope and the immortalized not least of all.</target>

After a not-insignificant wait, you are relieved to see them return alongside Metem, who informs you the Drop of Life was effective. Furthermore, he states that the souls in the Arcadion's repository have been freed, and henceforth, matches will pit only unenhanced fighters against each other. This unfortunately means you can no longer participate, as no fighter can contend against you. On the bright side, you still have your crowning ceremony to look forward to. Metem bids you come to the Arcadion when you are ready for the big event.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by speaking with the Arcadion attendant in front of the Arcadion.</target>

Reflecting on all that has come to pass, she admits that she played into the president's hands from the start─yet for all his scheming, without you at the center of it all, she is sure this favorable outcome would not have been possible. With that, she hopes that you, the newly designated “eternal grand champion,” will drop by to see her and everyone else when time allows.
