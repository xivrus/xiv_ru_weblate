Whilst he drives the locomotive, you are to ride a flatcar at the rear of the train so as to remain in range of your screaming steel foe. Though you have triumphed over your fair share of formidable enemies, it remains to be seen if prior experience has sufficiently prepared you for the coming battle with doom incarnate.

With luck, the rest of the ride back to Treno will afford some opportunity to catch your breath, for there is no telling what awaits within the city.

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMJ108_05433_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;With the Doomtrain's entourage destroyed, and the barrier restored, those inside the city can now rest easy. When you return to Main Street, you are received as heroes. Miayli, for her part, is delighted to see your group largely unharmed─though it is Krile who seems to draw her focus. Gently, she asks the younger Milalla whether she knows the name “Alayla,” prompting Krile to collapse to the flagstones in a combination of shock and exhaustion. Seeing this, Miayli promises to tell the tale of both Alayla and the key, though only after Treno's saviors have had sufficient rest. Fortunately, Y'shtola is quick to draw upon her healing magicks, that her friend might have her answers ere long.</target>
