        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMJ101_05426_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With Calyx defeated and his schemes undone, it is time for you and your companions to consider the future. Though the matter of investigating the Ascians' interference in historical events of the Ninth remains, Y'shtola volunteers to continue working with Shale to lay bare any lingering secrets, leaving Alphinaud and Alisaie free to return to their efforts to aid the people of Garlemald. Via a sudden linkpearl call, you learn that Erenville, too, will soon be departing for lands afar, so you hasten to the Backroom to collect Shale, who surely wishes to say her own farewells.</target>

To your companions' surprise, she is tempted away from her work with little fuss. Apparently, the documents recovered from the containment complex still require time to decrypt, and so she is free to attend to personal matters─such as seeing off a taciturn Viera.</target>
