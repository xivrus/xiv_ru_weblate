        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGRA305_05439_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You have climbed the ranks and through the tiers, at long last reaching the grand champion─the Tyrant. Long has he stood as an indomitable wall, repelling any would-be usurper to his throne. With martial mastery and the brutality of a behemoth his to wield, he will be a more daunting foe than any before. To seize his crown, you shall need to bring your all to bear.

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGRA305_05439_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;True to his name, the Tyrant fights you without reserve, wielding every weapon he has at his disposal to defeat you. Yet his iron fist cracks against your unshakable resolve, bringing an end to his long reign. As you prepare to return to the greenroom, you are filled with both a sense of fulfillment for your achievement─and a nagging apprehension of what may lie in store.

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGRA305_05439_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The heretofore innocuous referee is revealed to be the secret apparatus of the president, who beckons you to join him at the highest level of the Arcadion, where he holds the Drop of Life. Accompanied by Yaana and Metem, you follow the device to the megalomaniac's lair, where you discover his true form─a monstrosity known as the Lindwurm, the apparent namesake of Lindblum. Adorning his quarters─a recreation of Lindblum's grand theaters─is none other than the corpses of the immortalized. To Yaana's horror, you see Eutrope's body among them. The president explains that he has attempted to nurture a fighter who could contend against him over the years, never finding success until you appeared. Now, if you are to become the true grand champion, he demands you face him in battle, and give the people of Alexandria the greatest show they have ever seen.</target>

Perhaps it would be best to give her a moment to grieve and come to terms with her loss. </target>
