It was Alayla's role as Speaker that motivated her both to unlock the key's mysteries and to keep it from falling into the wrong hands, and as her successor, Miayli now feels it her duty to ensure that the relic is safe with you. Thankfully, she is satisfied with your conduct and more than willing to give her blessing that you keep it in your possession. Since Alayla took the historical documents pertaining to the key with her when she joined Preservation, the mayor can provide no further information concerning it─but she can provide Krile with assurances that neither her parents nor her living family would bear her ill will for calling the Source home.

As your comrades make for Overture Plaza, where Miayli has promised you fanfare to accompany your departure, she calls you back for one final word of warning. It is her belief that the key is guided to the hands of its bearers by a mysterious force not unlike fate itself...and if that force has taken an interest in you, you should expect danger to follow.</target>

Y'shtola immediately volunteers to join her, and they head off, promising to inform you the very moment they have conclusions to share. Krile, too, will be occupied for a time with her porxie project, so you find yourself free until you are inevitably called upon once more.</target>
