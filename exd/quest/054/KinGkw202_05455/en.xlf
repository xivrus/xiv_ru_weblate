        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGKW202_05455_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Lydirceil believes the voidsent's vessel will need to be crafted anew if it is to leverage its power. The group manages to glean that unlike its current guise, the creature's true form has limbs, and thus a plan emerges. Gerolt, for his part, sees an opportunity to further strengthen the bond between voidsent and vessel through the addition of a material known as “crystal paste” to the mixture used to fashion its body. And thus you find yourself tasked with retrieving one hundred portions of the substance for the weaponsmith.

Crystal paste can be obtained by completing duties.

On the Occult Crescent's South Horn, crystal paste can only be obtained from critical encounters, excluding the Forked Tower: Blood.

You may use the phantom glass to gauge your progress.
