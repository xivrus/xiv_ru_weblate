        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGDD102_05406_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The rhyming Fuath is keen to hear your progress within the churches of the First Light. Your description of the great sin eater in clerical robes prompts them to send for the king, and as the two of you await Titania, Aenc Daen explains why you are able to summon the Madbloom to your side by burning juniper incense. It seems the scheme hinges upon your beautiful branch's past life as a mortal─a life they willingly forfeited─and their status as one who might have once received First Light funeral rites. In any case, once Titania arrives to hear your report, they are less than surprised. According to their research, the church's last archbishop was allegedly slain by sin eaters, but Aenc Daen postulates that the cleric, in fact, turned. In a time rife with difficulty for the church, the truth was likely sealed away along with the transformed archbishop, who continued to wander the halls of chapels near and far, hoping against hope for oblivion.</target>
