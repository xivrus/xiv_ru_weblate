Hurrying inside, you quickly find the culprits─a tag team duo known as the Xtremes. Metem soon enters with cameras, and announces that they shall be your next opponents. It is only after all parties have left that Retsarra at last appears. He informs you that he has made progress with the rescue mission, and has discovered a clue regarding Neyuni and Eutrope's whereabouts. During your next match, he and the others intend to make a rescue attempt. With a mind to put on a good show and keep the spotlight on you as your comrades work in the shadows, you make your way back to the greenroom.</target>

The dynamic duo utilize the souls of storm divers, granting them the ability to manipulate water and fire respectively. To claim victory, you will need to adapt to the sudden and violent change of the elements─and the devastating coordinated maneuvers of a gnarly tag team.
