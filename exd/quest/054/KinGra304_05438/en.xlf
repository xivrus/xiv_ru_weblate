        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGRA304_05438_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With preparations for the heavyweight title match underway, Yaana proposes returning to her gym, where you can rest up before the big event. Yet no sooner do you exit the Arcadion than you are accosted by the heavyweights Vamp Fatale, Deep Blue, and Red Hot. Their ambush is cut short, however, by the sudden arrival of the Tyrant. Making short work of them, he then demands you learn of the Arcadion's history, if you are so determined to alter its future. It is clear through his explanation that he believes the usage of feral souls is crucial to the institution's identity. While there are fans who agree, there are also those who would welcome change. The Tyrant departs as suddenly as he appeared, and with your path clear at last, Yaana would hurry back to learn how the rescue mission fared.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGRA304_05438_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Entering the gym, you see that the others are yet to return, leaving Yaana visibly anxious. Just as you are trying to take her mind off of the mission, Retsarra at last appears─and behind him, a slightly disheveled, but otherwise hale Neyuni. Once all are present, she explains that the kidnappers removed Eutrope's regulator, and took her somewhere else. The very same modus operandi the president used to cover up the true fate of the immortalized. Yaana loses hope for a moment, until Dancing Green offers some much needed words of encouragement. Leaving Eutrope's rescue in Metem's hands, it is your mission to secure the cure by usurping the Tyrant's throne. With Neyuni's discovery that he intends to use the soul of a behemoth in battle, you can face him with full knowledge of what he may bring to bear. And it seems even Pomb, Hector's adorable kitten, wishes to cheer you on─how could you possibly lose?</target>
