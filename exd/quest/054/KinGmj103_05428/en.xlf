Sphene suggests nearby Treno, a port city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state and hub of trade on the continent, as a likely location of survivors. However, due to the violent lightning storm that spans as far as the eye can see, the airship cannot make the journey. Though Clerk PX-0093 remains on standby should you need to fly back to Living Memory, henceforth, you must walk.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may returnby speaking with Clerk PX-0061 at leynode mnemo.</target>
