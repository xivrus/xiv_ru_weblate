When I looked up, though─ &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Poof&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. Gone. Just like that. Please, won't you help me find it? I'll make it worth your while, I promise.</target>

I'll continue to search in this vicinity, though it's likely the creature scampered off farther afield. While I scour the area here, might you explore the eastern end of Rumination's Ramble?</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKZH014_04309_EUAION_004&lt;tab&gt;Oh, yes─ I should probably tell you about the creature we're looking for. We call it a bryon, a seedkin that bears a passing resemblance to a moss bloom. It will wither and perish without water...or become an overgrown monstrosity with too much! Keeping it hydrated is a delicate balancing act.</target>

Should you find it submerged in a body of water, try to remove as much moisture as you can. That ought to shrink it somewhat.</target>

Like as not, the bryon has thrown itself straight into a river or pond... Best be prepared for a fight.</target>

It's why we created it in the first place, to provide those in the wetlands a method by which they might prepare for sudden storms.</target>

I know not whose familiar you are, but you were a tremendous help. Here, for your pains.</target>
