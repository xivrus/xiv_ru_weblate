        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZH014_04309_EUAION_002&lt;tab&gt;I had been keeping such a close watch on the thing and it had been so well-behaved, I thought I could rest my eyes for a second. When I looked up, though─ &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Poof&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. Gone. Just like that. Please, won't you help me find it? I'll make it worth your while, I promise.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZH014_04309_EUAION_004&lt;tab&gt;Oh, yes─ I should probably tell you about the creature we're looking for. We call it a bryon, a seedkin that bears a passing resemblance to a moss bloom. It will wither and perish without water...or become an overgrown monstrosity with too much! Keeping it hydrated is a delicate balancing act.</target>

Should you find it submerged in a body of water, try to remove as much moisture as you can. That ought to shrink it somewhat.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZH014_04309_EUAION_012&lt;tab&gt;The bryon has the remarkable ability to predict precipitation and rainfall─if you see it shaking its leaves, you know the rain's on its way. It's why we created it in the first place, to provide those in the wetlands a method by which they might prepare for sudden storms.</target>
