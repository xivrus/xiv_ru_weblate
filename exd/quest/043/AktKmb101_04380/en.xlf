Krile invites you to join her in visiting her former schoolmaster, that you may express your gratitude for his kind words in the Rostra.</target>

She points out that Scholarch Montichaigne is a notoriously difficult man to track down, and the surest way to find him is to question the young scholars in the vicinity.</target>

Unable to speak further on the subject, he instead gives an impromptu lecture on the relationship between memories and the soul, and though its relevance is not yet apparent, you take his words to heart nonetheless.
