I couldn't help but notice that you've a way about you that simply screams “I have an affinity for creatures of the wilds.” And since I'm never wrong about such things, might I trouble you?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI014_04329_RESEARCHER04329_000_001&lt;tab&gt;You see, amongst the troops of trolls living in the Outer Circuit, I came upon one who was sick beyond measure.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="50" approved="yes"><source>50</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI014_04329_RESEARCHER04329_000_002&lt;tab&gt;I took the poor creature in at once and saw him healed, of course, but when I attempted to return him to his rightful home, he flew into a panic, as if he could not bear the thought of going back.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI014_04329_RESEARCHER04329_000_003&lt;tab&gt;To make matters worse, the troll saw fit to escape into a den of analas.

Would you seek out this troll of which I spoke? I shall provide you with his favorite food, and with it, you should be able to calm the piteous thing.
