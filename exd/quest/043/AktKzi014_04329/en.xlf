I couldn't help but notice that you've a way about you that simply screams “I have an affinity for creatures of the wilds.” And since I'm never wrong about such things, might I trouble you?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI014_04329_RESEARCHER04329_000_002&lt;tab&gt;I took the poor creature in at once and saw him healed, of course, but when I attempted to return him to his rightful home, he flew into a panic, as if he could not bear the thought of going back.</target>

I shall provide you with his favorite food, and with it, you should be able to calm the piteous thing. Hopefully that will be enough to see his senses restored and for him to come hurrying back.</target>
