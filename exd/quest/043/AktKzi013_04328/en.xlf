        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI013_04328_CHARMONT_000_001&lt;tab&gt;You see, I've whipped up an experimental new tincture, one that brings low a certain type of fiend. I had hoped a brave adventurer might test its efficacy for me in the field.</target>

Now then, about this solution of mine! With the help of some gleaners, I've crafted a concoction that can intenerate even the hardest of seedkin's casings, allowing one to make quick work of the beasts.</target>
