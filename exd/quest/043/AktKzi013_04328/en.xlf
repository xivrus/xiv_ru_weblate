				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKZI013_04328_CHARMONT_000_001&lt;tab&gt;You see, I've whipped up an experimental new tincture, one that brings low a certain type of fiend. I had hoped a brave adventurer might test its efficacy for me in the field.</target>

Good. Now then, about this solution of mine! With the help of some gleaners, I've crafted a concoction that can intenerate even the hardest of seedkin's casings, allowing one to make quick work of the beasts.</target>

Alas, my genius remains untested and thus unproven─which is where you come in. One so well versed in the ways of war should have no trouble at all verifying the tincture's efficacy, I should think.</target>
