Beleaguered by conquerors from the Alphatron Star as they were, none who would have followed the great wyrm were able to do so, and the life of the dragon before you was tragically cut short─however, Sehth Toskh clearly believes that there is some comfort to be found in the knowledge that their faith was well placed.</target>
