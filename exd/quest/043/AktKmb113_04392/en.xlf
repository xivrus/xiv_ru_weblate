				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKMB113_04392_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Negotiations with the Ist Legion have failed, and Alphinaud and Alisaie have been taken as hostages. It has been decided that you will escort Jullus to Camp Broken Glass, where he will present the conditions for Alisaie and Alphinaud's release. Before that, however, he requests that you inform two of the soldiers charged with retrieving your contingent's supplies of your imminent departure. He also gives the rather cryptic instruction that his comrades “ask the iyl” for further details, although its meaning is entirely lost on you for the moment.</target>

As neither appears willing to expound further on this riddle, your only choice is to glean the truth from Jullus himself.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKMB113_04392_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;When pressed about his instructions to ask the iyl, Jullus remains tight-lipped. The only hint he gives is that, providing your allies agree to Quintus's demands, the true meaning will be of no relevance to you. While this is hardly reassuring, he reminds you that the two of you must cooperate to ensure the negotiations reach successful conclusion. He then asks that you wait for him at a location nearby that he wishes to visit on the way to Camp Broken Glass.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKMB113_04392_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;After taking a brief detour past what remains of Jullus's home, you arrive at your camp. The negotiations have barely begun when you learn that Alphinaud and Alisaie have been freed by your comrades, depriving Quintus of his leverage. With the tables turned, Jullus and the other troops prepare to carry out their second set of orders by launching an attack on the Ilsabard contingent. Before any blood is spilled, however, you receive yet more surprising news. You learn that the Xth Legion─the reinforcements Quintus had been expecting─have instead agreed to a truce with the Grand Company of Eorzea. Quintus then commands his soldiers to comply with the Xth's wishes, thus ending the confrontation.</target>
