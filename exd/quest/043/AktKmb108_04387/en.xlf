Making a conscious effort not to dwell on the matter, the conversation turns to the collapse of the Empire. You come to the realization that some few were spared from being tempered by devices known as radios, which, perhaps more by coincidence than design, possess similar properties to the warding scales. The discussion is interrupted by the discovery of an intruder in the camp─a young Garlean soldier named Jullus who was caught stealing provisions. Despite his initial hostility, he is eventually persuaded to take you, Alisaie, and Alphinaud to parley with his commander.</target>

As Jullus is within earshot, you can only surmise it is a not-so-subtle reminder to take no action against the soldiers regardless of the circumstances─you are to observe their disposition only; and should you come to be in need of assistance, a concealed Thancred will likely be nearby to offer it. You ponder this possibility as you prepare for a journey across the snowy plains.</target>
