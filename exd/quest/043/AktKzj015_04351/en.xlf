Boph-bookh is whispering to themselves anxiously.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Boph-bookh is at a loss, being unable to find their companion, who seems to have wandered off somewhere. As said companion is the one who shares Boph-bookh's defining memories─and thus the key to their identity─they would have you seek out the stray Ea and see it safely returned to Elegeia. Seek out and tame the wandering Ea, and return it to Elegeia using the psychosuppressive rope.
