        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZJ015_04351_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Boph-bookh is at a loss, being unable to find their companion, who seems to have wandered off somewhere. As said companion is the one who shares Boph-bookh's defining memories─and thus the key to their identity─they would have you seek out the stray Ea and see it safely returned to Elegeia. Seek out and tame the wandering Ea, and return it to Elegeia using the psychosuppressive rope.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

Sadly, it appears that little or nothing remains of the Ea's identity. Nevertheless, you resolve to return the poor creature to Boph-bookh in the hopes that something might yet be done.</target>
