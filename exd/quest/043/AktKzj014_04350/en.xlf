For reasons that have escaped memory and understanding, she was seemingly frozen in time at that very instant, and has remained hovering on the border between life and death ever since. Confronted with a sight far too disturbing to bear, her mother became obsessed with her child's condition even while persisting in the denial of its truth─a state of affairs which has now culminated in her slipping away from Reah Tahra while you were absorbed in conversation.</target>
