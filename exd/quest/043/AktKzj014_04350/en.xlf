Confronted with a sight far too disturbing to bear, her mother became obsessed with her child's condition even while persisting in the denial of its truth─a state of affairs which has now culminated in her slipping away from Reah Tahra while you were absorbed in conversation.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="5" approved="yes"><source>5</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZJ014_04350_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;You follow the mother to the only place she could have gone, and are confronted with the shocking scene of her corpse.
