Alas, the moment of peace is shattered by a great wave of aether from the Tower of Babil. Though members of the contingent are protected by their warding scales, the imperials are not so fortunate, and wail as the tempering force begins to twist and torment their minds. You move to help, but are caught off guard by the sudden appearance of Fandaniel, who puts you to sleep and whisks you away...

When you awaken, you find yourself seated at a table set for dinner across from Zenos, as a smirking Fandaniel looks on. It is then you realize that your body is not your own, your soul having been extracted and placed within borrowed flesh. Your hosts then proceed to wax poetic about the primal Anima─summoned with the corpse of Varis himself, Fandaniel reveals─and Zenos's unflagging desire to cross swords with you once again.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMB115_04394_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;To spur you to accept his demand for a rematch, Zenos takes control of your true body, and you are forced to pursue him through half of Regio Urbanissima to prevent him from deceiving and harming your comrades. You catch up to him in the nick of time, but it appears there will be no celebrating this small victory, as Fandaniel gleefully announces that the Final Days are soon to begin.
