Being that you bear a corporeal form─as surely as I, as you can see, do not─perhaps you might offer me a way out of my predicament. You see, I have been attempting to fashion a vessel that may house our weary souls. Sadly, with no model to work from, I am ashamed to admit my experiments have failed─and rather spectacularly, at that. </target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKZJ011_04347_SEEKINGTHEBODY04347_000_001&lt;tab&gt;You may have noticed the by-products of my failed labors, as they now wander aimlessly and pathetically about these environs. I had intended to clean up this mess myself, but the task might prove difficult for a formless being such as myself. Might you put the pitiful creatures out of their misery in my stead?</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKZJ011_04347_SEEKINGTHEBODY04347_000_002&lt;tab&gt;I thank you, curious one! If you might also retrieve for me their internal cores in the process, I daresay it would be of great benefit to me in future experiments. In any event, I eagerly await word of your inevitable success.</target>

If you have forgotten the task, you are to hunt down two of those unfortunate luminions, and retrieve for me their cores. You need worry about nothing else─I understand that there is much here that is beyond your unenlightened mind's comprehension.</target>

While I am disheartened to see my efforts end in this way, I can only learn what I can from my failures, that my future experimentations might give rise to a satisfactory vessel.</target>
