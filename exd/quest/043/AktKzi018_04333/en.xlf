        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI018_04333_REACTORSTAFF04333_000_001&lt;tab&gt;I was due to receive a pair of beasts captured in Saint Mocianne's Arboretum, but the gleaner who's meant to make the delivery has yet to appear, and I've grown rather tired of waiting.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI018_04333_REACTORSTAFF04333_000_003&lt;tab&gt;Thank you. He ought to be relatively easy to spot I should think, considering he's traveling with two mud-covered seedkin.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI018_04333_GLEANER04333_000_011&lt;tab&gt;Ah, of course. I suppose all this waiting would make anyone rather nervous. I'll give my apologies to the operator when I deliver these specimens.</target>

I had not expected such an unfortunate accident would come of my curiosity, though.</target>

The gleaner's still alive and kicking, and the samples made it safely here─all thanks to you, of course. So, all's well that ends well, yes?</target>
