So, would you be willing to find said gleaner for me?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI018_04333_REACTORSTAFF04333_000_003&lt;tab&gt;Thank you. He ought to be relatively easy to spot I should think, considering he's traveling with two mud-covered seedkin.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="52" approved="yes"><source>52</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI018_04333_REACTORSTAFF04333_000_004&lt;tab&gt;Search west of here first. I'll check around here, just to make sure he's not rounding the corner or some such. Should you find him before I do, hurry back here, will you?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="53" approved="yes"><source>53</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI018_04333_GLEANER04333_000_010&lt;tab&gt;&lt;pant&gt; Thank goodness you're here...

I suppose all this waiting would make anyone rather nervous. I'll give my apologies to the operator when I deliver these specimens.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="55" approved="yes"><source>55</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI018_04333_GLEANER04333_000_012&lt;tab&gt;As for the specimens themselves...well, let's just say I'm rather surprised they're still in one piece, despite being bathed in lightning. Their earth alignment probably saved them, come to think of it.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="56" approved="yes"><source>56</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI018_04333_GLEANER04333_000_013&lt;tab&gt;At any rate, thank you, kind stranger. Doubt I'd still be among the living if not for your aid! Right then, I had better get going. Don't want to keep the operator waiting any longer than he already has.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="57" approved="yes"><source>57</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI018_04333_REACTORSTAFF04333_000_020&lt;tab&gt;There you are.

The gleaner's still alive and kicking, and the samples made it safely here─all thanks to you, of course. So, all's well that ends well, yes?</target></trans-unit></body></file></xliff>
