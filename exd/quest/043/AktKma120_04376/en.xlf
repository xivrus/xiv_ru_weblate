Though saddened, they are resolved to produce as many warding scales as they can, that all those held captive might be saved. Varshahn then arrives bearing messages from the satrap, who invites the Scions to meet with him in Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han.

Not to be fooled, however, Estinien demands an end to the charade, and so does the true ruler of Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han reveal himself: the great wyrm Vrtra, youngest of the first brood. The people of Ahewann's line have long posed as the satrap, while Varshahn, like other attendants before him, is a simulacrum created to serve as a vessel for the wyrm's will. The true history of Thavnair thus brought to light, Vrtra puts forth a proposal: if the Scions will agree to lead an assault on the Tower of Zot, he will provide them with more warding scales to shield them from its corruption. Though the offer is undeniably attractive, help will likely be required if you are to succeed in the mission, and it is decided that you will return to Sharlayan to confer with the rest of your order.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMA120_04376_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Though the meeting took an unexpected turn, you now have a clear objective ahead of you.
