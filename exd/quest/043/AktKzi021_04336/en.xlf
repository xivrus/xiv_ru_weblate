Tatasako appears to be deep in thought as he cranes his neck upward toward the infinite cosmos.</target>

Nevertheless, the vastness of space has not lost its intrigue. Indeed, the lunar surface is a land that yet captivates many of us, and some, such as myself, hope to one day journey there.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_013&lt;tab&gt;If we are to explore beyond the reaches of said safe areas, we will need a method by which we can survive those inimical wastelands for more than a few paltry moments.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI021_04336_TATASAKO_000_014&lt;tab&gt;Fortunately, we are researching one such method as we speak. It involves the storage of air─which is sadly absent up there─compressed into a wearable device which can purify the air expelled by its owner. The core you brought us will be a central component in its development.</target>
