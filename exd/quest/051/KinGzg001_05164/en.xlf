And where better to start than with remuneration? Alexandrians are awarded credits for their labor. These credits can be redeemed for a range of commodities─including spare souls, which are especially sought after.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_KINGZG001_05164_CONCIERGELADY05164_000_023&lt;tab&gt;When it comes to delivery work, risky commissions that require couriers to venture outside Everkeep offer greater compensation. On the other hand, simpler, safer tasks undertaken within the confines of the city─much like the one you so capably handled─are rewarded accordingly.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_KINGZG001_05164_CONCIERGELADY05164_000_024&lt;tab&gt;Now, seeing as you aren't registered in the citizen database, I'm afraid I can't provide you with credits, but hopefully this will suffice!</target>

In case you were wondering, I'm just as much a part of the system as any other honest Alexandrian, so you'll have to excuse me─those credits won't earn themselves!</target>
