Just when you thought life in the desert could not be more unpleasant, along come the snakes.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Just northwest of here, some of the railroad workers have been attacked by a pack of snakes. Aspis, to be exact.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_002&lt;tab&gt;I know what you're thinking, “Snakes don't hunt in packs, do they?” Well, these do, and there's one particularly huge one that seems to be the ringleader. If you're willing, I want you to go out there and kill it!</target>

Tricky part is, it usually stays hidden, so I recommend taking out a couple of the smaller ones to get its attention. When you're done, bring me proof of the kill, would you?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_007&lt;tab&gt;I reckon we could even use this to make an antivenom. If someone gets themselves bit, it might even save their life.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZE017_05135_WORRYWORKER05135_000_008&lt;tab&gt;Y'know, I almost hate to say it, but if there's any more of that snake still out there, we could sell its skin for leather. We can even eat its meat, which is surprising tasty. This might even end up being a good source of revenue for the company!</target>
