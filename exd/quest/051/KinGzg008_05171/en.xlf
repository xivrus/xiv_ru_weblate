Hundreds of years ago there was a terrible war we know as the Storm Surge. One of my ancestors─a scientist─had it made as an engagement ring.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZG008_05171_LOOKINGWOMAN05171_000_014&lt;tab&gt;Back then, electrope ore was worth a small fortune. A gesture like that would've been a surefire way to anyone's heart─well, according to my mother at least.</target>
