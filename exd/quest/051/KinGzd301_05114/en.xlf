He managed to distract them long enough for her to flee, but she fears the worst and begs you to go and find him near Golmajiik Grove.

Gotoll Ja was once a mercenary but was forced to retire after a serious injury. He expresses no little bitterness over his current impotence in battle, but curiosity regarding the wivres' strange behavior overpowers his discouragement.
