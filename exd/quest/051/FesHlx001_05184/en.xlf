After a little coaxing and a few leaps of logic─from the point of view of a voidsent, at least─Philcox realizes he can use his powers to help the commonfolk, and in doing so garner their appreciation in the form of gastronomic gifts. Boasting of his newfound potential to Papa Gruff, the latter suggests a contest to determine whose approach is superior. You can but pray their rivalry does not get out of hand...</target>
