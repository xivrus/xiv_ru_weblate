        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZE015_05133_WORRYWORKER05133_000_002&lt;tab&gt;Back then, I had me a favorite pickaxe, with a yeheheceyaa engraved into it. I figured I had no more use for it, so I left it behind. But with all the recent turmoil, I've found myself pining for it, as a reminder of a time when life was simpler.</target>

You look like you could hold your own, or at least manage to sneak in and grab the pickaxe before any of them notice you. Think you could give it a try?</target>
