This dilemma tugs at a similar quandary you had not long ago, and at your prompting, Ty'at Roh expresses an eager interest in speaking with locals regarding recent beast trouble.</target>

Beasts native to the Ja Tiika Heartlands are running rampant on the Ut'ohmu Horizon, and once innocuous wivres have turned feral. Something is amiss in Yak T'el, and both Mamool Ja and Xbr'aal alike would discover what. Ty'at Roh innocently suggests asking around the city, but Gotoll Ja refuses to let a Xbr'aal go wandering off alone. You, however, have earned your reputation as friend and comrade to all Mamool Ja, so you head off to inquire about wildlife.</target>
