It outlines a tentative countermeasure to protect the farmland, but will require the use of a specific device said to be located at Yyasulani Station. Rather than risk another solo venture, Shaloaci has asked you to accompany her there. Once your preparations have been made, you are to rendezvous at Yyupye's Halo.</target>
