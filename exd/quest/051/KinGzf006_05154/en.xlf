        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZF006_05154_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The hungry Milalla finds the vegetables of the outskirts to be absolutely revolting compared to the manufactured rations of Everkeep. He would sooner starve himself than take another bite, but the Cornservant has an idea to please his selective palate. Using a generous helping of kernels from their own cob, the Cornservant creates popcorn, and it is love at first bite for the Milalla. Realizing now that foods should not always be taken at face value, the Milalla runs off to apologize to the outskirts' farmers.</target>
