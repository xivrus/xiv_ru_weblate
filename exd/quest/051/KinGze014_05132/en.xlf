That must be why those darned popotoes have been showing up in droves. At this rate, the whole place'll be overrun!</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZE014_05132_WORRY05132_000_003&lt;tab&gt;I'd go out there and spread the repellent myself, but they'd make a meal of me lickety-split. Reckon you could take care of it for me?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZE014_05132_WORRY05132_000_004&lt;tab&gt;Oh, and the repellent doesn't take effect right away, so any flying popotoes already there'll probably need culling the old-fashioned way. If you could take care of that, too, you'd be doing us all a huge favor!</target>

They even tried to take a bite out of more than one of the residents!</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZE014_05132_WORRY05132_000_022&lt;tab&gt;We tried asking the Dustwatch to come deal with 'em, but they didn't wanna get involved in culling wild...um, tubers. Setting up a perimeter fence was another option, only we're short on people and building materials. That's why we came up with the repellent.</target>
