        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPEL006_05198_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Liplu's guest turns out to be the Pelu in pink herself, Mablu. You listen to the friends recall a conversation in which Mablu proposed they work together to help revitalize struggling local communities through the power of tourism. And indeed, they have done just that─though both agree this is only the beginning. They will continue striving to spread happiness through trade in accordance with Pelu traditions, and you have no reason to doubt that they will succeed. Mablu bids you both farewell, while the travel agency founder waits to speak with you once again.</target>
