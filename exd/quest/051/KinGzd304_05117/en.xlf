        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZD304_05117_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Though confident in his craftsmanship, Gotoll Ja fears a scenario in which the bombs fail to crush the scalebuds to satisfaction, leaving him face-to-horn with yet another aggravated wivre. Begging your cooperation once more, he entrusts you with a bundle of his handmade smoke bombs and bids you test them on nearby wivres.

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZD304_05117_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You deliver the good news to Gotoll Ja, who is relieved to hear his handiwork could be of service. Bakool Ja joins you, eager to collect some bombs not only for himself, but for all those in Mamook who need protection against the raging beasts. With some nudging from his wife, Gotoll Ja finally realizes the strengths he still has to offer his community. Accepting his continued worth as a mercenary, Gotoll Ja turns to you with new hope in his eyes. He thanks you for all your help and vows to do what he can for his city going forward.

Alas, the source of the wivres' feral behavior yet remains a mystery...</target>
