The boy reveals that he was chased away while searching for plant specimens in an effort to emulate his hero. He asks you to brave the bushes in his stead, and bring back nepheletta fronds, irenaris leaves, and some banana leaves for his collection.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

Hearing your tales of adventure, however, reignites a flame within the boy, and he renews his vow to explore the world. When he fades from existence, his eyes are gleaming with unmistakable wonder.</target>
