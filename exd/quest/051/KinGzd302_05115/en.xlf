While she knows the land better than you do, you are more practiced at fending off grumpy beasts, so you agree to rid the roads of potential threats on your way to the cenote past Golmajiik Grove.

The cyan crystal glimmers in her hand as she speaks of the past and the man her husband once was. Gotoll Ja's injury was debilitating not only to his body but his mind, and now he seemingly struggles to find new purpose. Shaking herself from her reverie, Shiidil Ja suggests you return to Mamook for now.</target>
