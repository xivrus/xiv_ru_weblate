        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGZD303_05116_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Apparently, wivre attacks have been on the rise in recent days, leaving Mamook in a state of both bafflement and inconvenience. Wivres are prized for their labor, making simple extermination an unviable solution. The only remaining option seems to be offering armed escorts to people traveling outside the city, but Shiidil Ja is adamantly against Gotoll Ja's involvement with such a scheme. Thanks to your insight, Gotoll Ja remembers that it is more important to ensure safety than to rush to combat, and instead starts considering diversionary tactics. He settles on a smoke bomb infused with an unappealing scent, and sends you off to Bakool Ja the wivre handler to discover what smell wivres detest.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
