She admits to being hungry, but because she has lost her sense of taste, eating has become a chore she actively avoids. The Cornservant believes such a crisis calls for a special dish. After a brief moment of reflection, they are struck with inspiration and, within moments, conjure a most delectable taco. The woman takes a bite and is gripped by nostalgia that brings her sense of taste rushing back. She thanks both you and the Cornservant before taking her leave, promising to be better about her neglected diet.</target>
