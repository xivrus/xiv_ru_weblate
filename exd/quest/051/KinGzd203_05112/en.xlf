The aspiring hunter then tells you his dream of bringing both peoples together in fellowship, that they might protect their homes as a collective. However, first he must be accepted into the hunters' brotherhood, and to do that he must pass the trial. It is to be held at the Xobr'it Cinderfield, and Ty'at Roh asks you to accompany him there to meet the arbiters of the competition─and your opponents.</target>
