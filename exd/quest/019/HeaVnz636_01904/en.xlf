While they mean no harm, they are also blissfully unaware of the damage inflicted upon Gildon and his fellow knights. Though it pains him to do so, he has resolved to putting them down should their numbers grow too large.</target>

As they continue to grow in number, they have become a hindrance to our work in the area. It would be a boon to the camp if you could slay four of them to thin their ranks.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ636_01904_GILDON_000_021&lt;tab&gt;Their coming near the outpost is but a recent phenomenon, no doubt stemming from curiosity. The dhalmels are docile in nature, but it's quite easy for such large animals to injure our men unintentionally. It pains me that we cull them so, but we do what we must for the good of the camp.</target>
