He suspects the dhalmels have come closer to Camp Cloudtop to satisfy their curiosity. While they mean no harm, they are also blissfully unaware of the damage inflicted upon Gildon and his fellow knights. Though it pains him to do so, he has resolved to putting them down should their numbers grow too large.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ636_01904_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Slay dhalmels.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ636_01904_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Report to Gildon.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ636_01904_GILDON_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Good to see you, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;.

The dhalmels are docile in nature, but it's quite easy for such large animals to injure our men unintentionally. It pains me that we cull them so, but we do what we must for the good of the camp.</target></trans-unit></body></file></xliff>
