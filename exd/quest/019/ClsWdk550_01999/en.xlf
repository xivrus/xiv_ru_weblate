He avoided death narrowly because a passing priest saved his life. Now, Barthovieu wishes to repay the debt, and turns to you for help. It appears the good brother is something of a conjurer, who would no doubt welcome a new staff. Speak with the Orthodox monastic at the aetheryte plaza in Ishgard, and see what kind of cane he would like.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK550_01999_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The priest is a jolly fellow, who has apparently already refused a gift of thanks once.

You are perplexed for a moment, until Philipallais enters with a brace of fowl. It so happens that the child had actually asked the priest to watch over his father, and had promised him a gift of thanks for the service. The confusion cleared up, the priest takes his leave of you. Philipallais asks you in a quiet voice to keep all this secret from his father, for fear that Barthovieu's pride would suffer. Return now to Barthovieu, and inform him that the priest has been properly thanked.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK550_01999_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Barthovieu is pleased your work has settled any debt he owed the priest.
