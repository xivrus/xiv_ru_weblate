Slay the wisents north of Camp Cloudtop and obtain four slabs of their meat.</target>

He is grateful the wisents are present for just such an occasion. As it turns out, they are not indigenous to the islands, but were brought to serve as livestock. He goes on to say they plan to raise sheep as well, but for now they will settle for the less-than-savory meat of wisents. </target>
