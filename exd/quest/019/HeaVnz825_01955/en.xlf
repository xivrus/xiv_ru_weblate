In exchange for massages from the goblin, Edred has been slaying Orn kites for their meat. The goblin ties these downed birds into braces with a rope, before performing the effective─but excruciatingly painful─traditional goblin massage techniques on him. Inspired by their cooperation and ashamed of doubting the innocent goblin, Notched Bone affirms his desire to be a citizen of Idyllshire. Confused but ever generous, the goblin eagerly welcomes him with an excruciatingly painful goblin massage.</target>
