Notched Bone and Dedean recently arrived in the settlement, but seem to be having difficulty fitting in. She asks you to spend some time with them and make sure they don't cause any problems. She seems to think that, with a little guidance from you, these two refugees will come to enjoy life in Idyllshire.</target>

Since they can't found a new city on their own, they hope to rally other adventurers at Idyllshire to their cause and have prepared flyers which they ask you to help distribute. Find adventurers in Idyllshire and the Answering Quarter and hand out the flyers to them.</target>
