She has been having terrible luck fishing lately, but these wriggly little tadpoles make such exceptional bait that her luck should start to turn immediately. She gives you a bag of coins in payment─take it back to Midnight Dew.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_HEAVNZ813_01943_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You return Feltsmox's payment to Midnight Dew. She explains that fishing is a popular pastime amongst goblins, and the resulting demand for squigglywogs is helping her turn a tidy profit. While the goblins plan to settle a town in Idyllshire, Midnight Dew suspects that many goblins are just natural-born wanderers. She doubts it will be long before Feltsmox feels the need to leave the city and travel the realm.</target>
