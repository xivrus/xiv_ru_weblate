        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ813_01943_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Feltsmox thanks you for the squigglywogs. She has been having terrible luck fishing lately, but these wriggly little tadpoles make such exceptional bait that her luck should start to turn immediately. She gives you a bag of coins in payment─take it back to Midnight Dew.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ813_01943_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You return Feltsmox's payment to Midnight Dew. She explains that fishing is a popular pastime amongst goblins, and the resulting demand for squigglywogs is helping her turn a tidy profit. While the goblins plan to settle a town in Idyllshire, Midnight Dew suspects that many goblins are just natural-born wanderers. She doubts it will be long before Feltsmox feels the need to leave the city and travel the realm.</target>
