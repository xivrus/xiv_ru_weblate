        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA408_01995_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The scent of the twice-mulled wine is enough to bring Gerraldieux's memories of the young mother to the fore, and words unbidden begin to spill from his lips. So filled with love and compassion for her fellow man was she that, despite toiling tirelessly to feed and clothe her daughter, she took time to help Gerraldieux administer succor to the poor. Her loss was keenly felt, most of all by the child she left behind, whom even now the monk can recall passing days atop the walls, her raven black hair flowing in the wind as she stared out into the mists in silence. Leave the monk to his memories and return to the Forgotten Knight.</target>
