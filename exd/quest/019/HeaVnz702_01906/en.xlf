But something about this whole affair doesn't sit right with him. What he finds most troubling about this is how such a resourceful girl could not afford to guard herself against the chilly nights of Ishgard. Brictt asks that you speak with patrons at the Forgotten Knight and find her belongings for clues.</target>

The knight tells you she listened intently to his stories of Camp Cloudtop, a quiet, dragon&lt;var 1F /var&gt;free settlement in the Sea of Clouds. Amongst her belongings are flyers for this encampment and a large sum of gil. Return to Brictt and tell him of what you learned.</target>

Osaulie was orphaned years ago after an attack by dragons, and he suspects she longed to escape Ishgard. In the end, her desire to save every last coin of her money cost her life. Brictt is saddened that a child with such determination could be denied her dream. As a small gesture of respect, he asks you take her belongings to Camp Cloudtop and erect a small memorial in her honor.</target>
