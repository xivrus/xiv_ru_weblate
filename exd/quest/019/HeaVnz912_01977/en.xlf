Afterwards, Kupli Kuki relates a similar story that tells of moogles that left for the surface after the gods in the heavens started squabbling. The moogles surmise that these two stories must be telling the same occurrence in different ways, and are overjoyed to find that once the moogles of the sky and surface lived happily together.
