When Kupli Kuki presents his offering of kupo nuts to Mogule, they make a surprising discovery: they are exactly the same kupo nuts as the ones that are grown in Moghome. The moogles have more in common than they thought, and decide to go ask Chieftain Moglin for any information he might have that would shed light on this uncommon coincidence.</target>

Afterwards, Kupli Kuki relates a similar story that tells of moogles that left for the surface after the gods in the heavens started squabbling. The moogles surmise that these two stories must be telling the same occurrence in different ways, and are overjoyed to find that once the moogles of the sky and surface lived happily together. They are eager to deepen their bonds even further─be ready to get involved in all kinds of moogle mayhem.</target>
