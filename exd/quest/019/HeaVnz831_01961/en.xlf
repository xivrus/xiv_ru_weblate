Preventing them from breeding seems to be the best idea, so he asks you to slay three great morbol seedlings. Unfortunately, these slippery little creatures rarely come out of hiding. However, they love fish, and can be lured from hiding by using fish as bait. Feltsmox also loves fish─she is always fishing. Perhaps she can provide some to use as bait. Find her and ask her.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ831_01961_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You find Feltsmox and she agrees to cooperate. Unfortunately, she still has had no luck in catching any fish whatsoever. But hope is not lost. She assures you that morbol seedlings are not discerning eaters. They can be just as easily lured from hiding with fishing bait as they can with the fish themselves. Meet with her at Saint Mocianne's Arboretum and put her plan to the test.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ831_01961_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Just as Feltsmox promised, the great morbol seedlings are quick to emerge when she throws a handful of fishing bait into the water.
