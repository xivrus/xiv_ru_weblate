As the stock they stole is too heavy to be transported on foot, she predicts that the bandits hope to escape by boat. While she contacts her comrades to have them stake out the riverbank, she asks that you investigate the Answering Quarter ruins to see if any sign of the bandits or their ill-gotten booty yet remains.</target>
