        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ908_01973_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Wait as Mogule might, the moogles from the Twelveswood are nowhere to be seen. He is sure that his directions to meet at the floating island among the sea of clouds were perfectly clear. However, it seems he underestimated the vastness of the landmasses above the skies, and also the clarity of his own directions, and after conferring with you realizes it may be possible the Twelveswood moogles wrongly traveled to the Sea of Clouds. Since &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;someone&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; has to stay behind at Moghome should the Twelveswood moogles eventually show up, Mogule bids you go to the Sea of Clouds to look for the missing moogles. Travel to Camp Cloudtop and ask its inhabitants if they know aught of a band of moogles amongst their midst.</target>

Seek out Gildon near the Rosehouse and see if he has any information that may guide you in your search.</target>
