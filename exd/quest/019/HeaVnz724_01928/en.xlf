Some beast is makin' off with &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;my&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; hard-earned chocobos afore I can gather 'em from the traps. Accounts from my men say it's one o' the biggest bears they've ever laid eyes on.

I've got a plan to lure out the greedy bugger, but I need someone reliable to take it down for me─an' there ain't many more reliable than you!</target>
