        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ818_01948_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Dripwix has been hard at work formulating new rules and regulations to govern the people of Idyllshire. The first such rule is that meticulous records be kept of all tool rentals. He has prepared a large and comprehensive ledger for recording countless details of each and every tool rental.  While Dripwix concocts yet more rules, take the ledger to Drydox to use for all future tool rentals.</target>

Take this map to Tapklix, such that his troops may know where to patrol and how close the Illuminati may stray before a counteroffensive should be launched.</target>
