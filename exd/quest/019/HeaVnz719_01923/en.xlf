Eventually he decides to take care of the beasts that have been stalking the forest to the east. Or rather, he decides to have &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; take care of them. Head to the eastern camp and speak with Guenaret for any information regarding your targets' whereabouts.</target>

Although &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; were not actually the one meant to do the job, Guenaret seems eager to be rid of the menace. Go north and search for any signs of the beasts, which are said to resemble giant spiders.  </target>
