Eventually he decides to take care of the beasts that have been stalking the forest to the east. Or rather, he decides to have &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; take care of them. Head to the eastern camp and speak with Guenaret for any information regarding your targets' whereabouts.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ719_01923_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;After speaking to Guenaret about the oversized arachnids, you learn that O'bhen Tia himself demanded that Guenaret wait until someone was sent to settle the problem. Although &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; were not actually the one meant to do the job, Guenaret seems eager to be rid of the menace. Go north and search for any signs of the beasts, which are said to resemble giant spiders.  </target>

With his chief's intentions still a mystery, he gives you your reward and begrudgingly returns to his list of tasks.</target>
