				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_HEAVNZ822_01952_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Dedean still seems to think that the goblins of Idyllshire are somehow brainwashing the immigrants that arrive in the settlement. He saw a goblin leading a group of adventurers─who had just arrived in Idyllshire─out towards Saint Mocianne's Arboretum. He has convinced himself that they are being taken there to be brainwashed and is not interested in anything you have to say to the contrary. Maybe if you find out what the goblin and his party of adventurers &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;are&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; doing, you can explain it to this Lalafell and disabuse him of his delusions.</target>

Speak next with the goblin himself and confirm that there is nothing even slightly suspicious going on.</target>

Just as expected, he is simply showing the new arrivals to Idyllshire what they should be aware of as citizens of the settlement. Hopefully this will be enough to assuage Dedean's suspicions.</target>
