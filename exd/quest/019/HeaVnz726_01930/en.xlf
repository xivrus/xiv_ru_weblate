The Vath are ill prepared to deal with a direct, all-out offensive from the much larger Gnath hive. Their only option is a preemptive assault, weakening the enemy before it can finish mobilizing.</target>

He goes on to explain how he had knowledge of the planned attack: While the Vath of the Nonmind cannot hear the thoughts of the Gnath Onemind, this is not due to a complete severing of the mental connection; the link is merely massively weakened. Some Vath can, from time to time, perceive the Onemind's thoughts. It does not seem that the Gnath are aware of this vestigial connection or the knowledge it provides the Vath with.</target>
