        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ814_01944_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Dripwix has been keeping a log of the various problems he has observed in the goblins' newly founded settlement. This would be an invaluable tool in helping address the problems Slowfix has been experiencing, but unfortunately the logbook somehow fell into the hands of the Illuminati. One of the espertype magitek vangobs G-III that patrol the area has it, but Dripwix does not know which one. If you destroy enough of the things, the logbook is bound to turn up.</target>

Slowfix is strongly opposed to the idea, believing that rules would run counter to the principles of freedom and liberty that the settlement was founded on. Eventually he relents when the problems being caused by the settlement's complete lack of laws and procedures are pointed out to him.</target>
