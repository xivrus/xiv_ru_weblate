However, he is not willing to give up. He reveals to you that Matoya secretly has one more broom outside of her cave, and he has reason to believe that it possesses knowledge that the others do not. He bids you speak with the brooms in the cave once more, that you might learn the incantation by which their mysterious fellow may be summoned. Begin by consulting the straightforward broom.</target>
