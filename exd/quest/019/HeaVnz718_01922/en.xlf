        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ718_01922_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Hervoix, a freshly arrived hunter to the bustling Tailfeather, has received the unenviable task of having to kill one of the many beasts that prey on the forest's chocobos. Claiming that hunters have no business slaying bothersome pests, he instead plans to bestow a purse of gil to any adventurer willing to do his work for him─and you eagerly accept the offer. Head to the highlands near the southeast camp and rid the forest of three chocobo legtraps.</target>

Hervoix reluctantly accepts this new work and sulks back to his post at Tailfeather. Now that he is out of earshot from his chief, try asking him once again for your promised reward.</target>
