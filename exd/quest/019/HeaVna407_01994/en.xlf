Reminiscing, she speaks of how the girl fell in love with the nobleman she served─an Elezen baron with striking red eyes. Alas, the baron took advantage of the girl's affections, and cast her out onto the streets when she became pregnant with his child. She passed away sometime later, after returning to the Brume and giving birth, but Hierytha only learned of it years after the fact. Leave the maidservant to her memories and return to the Forgotten Knight.</target>
