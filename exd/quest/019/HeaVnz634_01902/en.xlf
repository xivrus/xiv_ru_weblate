He notes that it is particularly rich, perhaps because it is so fresh. As you leave, he suggests you clean yourself up. You cannot help but wonder if the job was dirtier than he would have you believe.</target>

I need you to retrieve five bushels of blackloam for the crops. You can find it in the fields east of here where the wisents graze. I would go myself but I haven't the stomach for it. Going near those gargantuan beasts, that is.</target>
