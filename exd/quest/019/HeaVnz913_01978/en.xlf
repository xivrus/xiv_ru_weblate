Ask Chieftain Moglin for what is sure to be a thrilling history lesson on the origins of Moghome names.</target>

It seems that the two monsters may have followed Kupli Kuki and the other Twelveswood moogles all the way from the Sea of Clouds.

While he doesn't know the exact reason that all the moogles in Moghome start with “Mog,” he informs you that the first chieftain was said to be named Moggle. Kupli Kuki fumbles around with the name for a bit before discovering that it is quite similar to Moggle Mog, and surmises that the name must have changed as the story was passed down from generation to generation in the Twelveswood. If Kupli Kuki's guess is right, then Chieftain Moglin is himself a direct descendant of Good King Moggle Mog XII, and the Pomguard are direct descendants of the Good King's household guard. Kupli Kuki is amazed that he is among such historic figures of mooglekind, although the Moghome moogles themselves do not seem very fazed at all. Mogleo finally closes this historic conversation by offering the Twelveswood moogles one kupo nut each for their previous bravery, an offer which the moogles eagerly agree to. The moogles look forward to deepening the bonds of friendship between sky and surface.</target>
