        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ823_01953_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;It seems that Notched Bone and Dedean have not eaten in quite some time and they are understandably very hungry. What is less understandable is their refusal to eat the food they have been provisioned with by the goblins. They are under the impression that it is poisoned and are completely unreceptive to suggestions to the contrary. Notched Bone asks you to slay a crawler and harvest its flesh such that he and Dedean may eat. Raw crawler flesh is inedible, but it should be fine if cooked thoroughly. Notched Bone asks that after harvesting the crawler meat, you roast it at the goblin bonfire in the Answering Quarter. Feed these stubborn two now, and deal with their prejudices later.</target>

Upon hearing this, the goblin becomes very concerned. No matter how it is prepared, crawler flesh is inedible and can cause severe stomach pains in goblins. He doubts that Lalafell or Roegadyn will fare any better from eating it. He provides you with some gobbietea, which should help to alleviate any stomach problems the two refugees might suffer, and requests that you return to the two and check on their well-being.</target>
