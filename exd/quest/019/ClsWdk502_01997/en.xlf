        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Timbermaster Beatin produces a spear shaft found in the North Shroud. Though the head has broken off, he proceeds to identify it as Ishgardian in origin and fawn over its quality. He feels that such a treasure must be returned to its rightful owner, and asks you as a well-traveled adventurer to visit the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly in Ishgard. Make your way there, and find a veteran knight who might be able to tell you to whom the spear once belonged.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK502_01997_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Barthovieu, a lowly soldier, accepts the broken lance in amazement. He tells you his father was weak, a knight who left to fight Dravanians, but instead died an honorless death at the claws of mere beastkin. Barthovieu now lives in squalor as a struggling single father. For the sake of his son, he means to earn himself knighthood by hunting dragons. However, he needs a bow to do so, and would ask you to make him one after he can scrape together the necessary funds.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Barthovieu upon reaching level 53.</target>
