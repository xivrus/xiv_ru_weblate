        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ821_01951_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Notched Bone is still convinced that the goblins have brainwashed the citizens of Idyllshire, and you are unable to convince him otherwise. He hopes to cure the citizens of this brainwashing by exposing what he thinks is a grand, nefarious scheme by the goblins. He saw a goblin armed and heading out towards the Collectors' Quarter and he is sure she was up to no good. Perhaps if you find out what this goblin is &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;really&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; up to, you can convince Notched Bone that they can be trusted.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ821_01951_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You speak with the goblin and learn that she is exterminating the damselflies in the area. Apparently there are egg-bearing damselflies nearby which must be eliminated before they can lay their eggs. If they do, the young that hatch will quickly get out of hand. Help the goblin by slaying three of the damselflies.</target>
