        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ720_01924_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Next on Hervoix's list of tasks is the removal of iron leg traps that have been set up around a camp to the north. He ignores the obvious connection between chocobo traps and hunting, and insists that this should not be among a hunter's duties. Eager to push his work onto the nearest adventurer in need of coin, Hervoix enlists your aid. Head to the northern chocobo camp and ask any nearby hunters if they know aught of the reported traps.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNZ720_01924_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;At the camp you come across a hunter who explains that O'bhen Tia forcefully stopped him from removing the traps. It seems the chief was insistent upon letting his “apprentice” disable the traps himself. He says the traps were likely set by a band of outlaw hunters, as such traps are liable to injure the most profitable part of a chocobo: its legs. Go east of the camp and search for the traps, and be on guard for any hostile hunters along the way.</target>

Skeptical of his chief's aims, Hervoix returns to consider the next job he─or &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;someone&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; else─will undertake.</target>
