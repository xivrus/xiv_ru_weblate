Luckily, in this dark hour, a kindly adventurer happens to be nearby, willing to lend Hervoix a helping hand. Travel to the northeastern camp and speak with Aimebert, who likely has knowledge about the supposed garbage buildup.</target>

Search the area around the northeast camp for any signs of suspicious characters, and if you find any, make sure they follow the rules of Tailfeather. If by chance you are attacked, defend yourself as best you can.</target>
