It appears the veteran hunter took an arrow in his protégé's stead─an arrow loosed by none other than the exiled Bauricoin. O'bhen Tia will help Hudde return to Tailfeather to be treated.

Q'yantaa, hot-headed as ever, hastens to Bauricoin's alleged location without considering the possibility of a trap. Both Hervoix and O'bhen Tia follow after her out of fear for her safety. Speak with Loupard to see what the best course of action could be.</target>

Q'yantaa demands to know the whereabouts of Gysol's chocobo hatchling, and Bauricoin coldly explains that he cooked the poor bird, justifying his cruel misdeeds by stating that his actions are no different than any of the other hunters in Tailfeather. Q'yantaa hesitates, finally deciding to partake of the chocobo meat prepared by Bauricoin, stating that she is doing it out of respect for the hatchling's sacrifice. She further goes on to explain that the hunters of Tailfeather work to maintain the natural order, while outlaws like Bauricoin only threaten to destroy it. Hervoix seems to finally understand the significance of his chief's philosophy. Q'yantaa will return to Tailfeather to break the tragic news to Gysol, and Hervoix will take Bauricoin to Tailfeather in shackles. Return to Tailfeather and tell Loupard about what happened at the camp.</target>

The other hunters reflect upon the incident, and hope that their partners both take away the fact that hunting─and life─does not always have an ideal outcome. Optimistic that everyone will come out of this tragedy a stronger person in the end, Hudde and O'bhen Tia leave to continue their hunting. Loupard thanks you once again, excited about the future growth of the two hunting teams.</target>
