        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ810_02838_WEIDHERI_000_001&lt;tab&gt;You see, I need legs from the chapulis hopping about outside of town─three or so should do the trick. I'd go myself, but they'd stomp me in the ground faster than a sabotender in a sandstorm.</target>

It's a specialty of mine─a nice, spicy broth with chunks of meat so tender they practically melt in your mouth. I find chapuli legs work best.</target>
