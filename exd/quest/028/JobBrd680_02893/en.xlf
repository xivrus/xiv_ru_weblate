        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBRD680_02893_GUYDELOT_000_141&lt;tab&gt;As for Gylbarde's journal...I'm still holding on to it. Told 'em it's for the chief to hand over. They were none too pleased, fancy that.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBRD680_02893_GUYDELOT_000_142&lt;tab&gt;Y'see, unlike our friend Sanson, I don't have much faith in the order. Don't trust 'em to act in our best interests. The journal's our bargaining chip, not only with them but Nourval besides.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBRD680_02893_GUYDELOT_000_143&lt;tab&gt;Would be good to bring old Jehantel into it as well. He'd want to know, and might even have some sage advice to share.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBRD680_02893_GUYDELOT_000_144&lt;tab&gt;But for now, we sit tight─wait and see what the order and Nourval will do. And then we plan some doings of our own. Till then, rest up and save your strength, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;. We're gonna need it.</target>
