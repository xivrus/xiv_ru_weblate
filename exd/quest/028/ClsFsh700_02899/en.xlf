At its essence a celebration of the spirit of the cooperation between man and Kojin, the ritual will unfold as follows: the Kojin, joined by Govv, will pursue the plesiosaurs from beneath the waves, chasing them to the surface, where the anglers lying in wait will lure them in. As the guildmaster's most proven protégé, you are tasked by Wawalago with hauling in the lion's share of your prized prey. Make for the waters of Onokoro, and do battle with these ferocious fiends of the deep!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Together with your companions, you haul in a heaping pile of plesiosaurs, pleasing the kami of the deep and restoring peace to the oceans and balance to the natural order of things. Govv grows concerned, however, when he can spy no sign of his precious shooting stars despite the removal of their most puissant predator, and dives into the depths in pursuit. At Wawalago's behest, you join him, and after a brief moment of concern, are treated to the stunning sight of a massive school of young harutsuge swimming all around you. Breathing a sigh of relief, you return to the surface with Govv, taking solace that your efforts were not for naught, and these delightful denizens of the sea will survive and prosper. Back in Isari, Wawalago begins to pontificate on the potential repercussions of your actions today, when he is interrupted by an irate Sisipu, who he neglected to inform of his intent to make the journey east. As the two run off, you turn to your companions with a smile, happy to see man and beastman alike united by a deep love of the sea.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Reyna in Kugane.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Join Wawalago in Isari.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;&lt;var 08 E3E802E803 ((Catch giant plesiosaurs)) ((Deliver the giant plesiosaurs to Wawalago in Isari)) /var&gt;.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSFSH700_02899_WAWALAGO_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Ho there, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;!
