She has been instructed to hand over the package upon telling her it is time to “rekindle the flames of hope.” Unfit to make the journey herself, Berehta asks you to retrieve her son's parting gift. </target>

It says they are date seeds from Garlemald, and will grow even in the most barren soil. As she leaves to inform the others of what she received, a mysterious figure steps in from the shadows, and reveals himself to be the allegedly deceased Erart. He believes his countrymen will not forgive his actions, even if they were for the sake of the Resistance, and so he faked his own death. He has resigned himself to traveling abroad to continue the fight against Garlemald in a distant land. To that end, he takes his leave, knowing Coldhearth rests in good hands.</target>
