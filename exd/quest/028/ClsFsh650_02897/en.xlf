Unfortunately, the name was all she could garner from her conversations, as none had seen the harutsuge's schools swimming in the vicinity as of late. Reyna then suggests speaking with another tribe talented in fishing─namely the Kojin, who are well acquainted with the Far Eastern depths. Make for Tamamizu to see if these turtlish types can tell you any more about the precise location of the spawning beds.</target>
