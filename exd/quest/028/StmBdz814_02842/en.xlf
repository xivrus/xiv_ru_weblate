The problem, however, is they are unable to bring this man in for inquiry. Afraid to speak more on the matter out in the open, he insists you speak with Baut, the person in question.  </target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ814_02842_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Baut is startled by your presence, but is soon relieved when you explain Brazen Brook sent you to help. The reason for his initial panic is made clear when he reveals that he is, in fact, a centurion of the Garlean forces. He ordered his men to retreat in lieu of a crushing defeat at the hands of the Alliance, but ran into an unexpected problem when attempting to turn himself in. To better explain his predicament, he insists you speak with the people of Ala Ghiri and hear what they have to say of him.</target>

Baut appears to be well-liked, with some townsfolk being surprisingly protective of him. As the pieces of the puzzle slowly fall into place, you return to speak with him and confirm your findings.</target>

Resigned to being a prisoner of war, the Alliance has yet to take him into custody for fear of a revolt from the villagers who have, for reasons unknown, grown to care for him like one of their own. Not wishing for them to come to harm, Baut asks for your help in persuading the villagers to allow for his peaceful surrender.</target>
