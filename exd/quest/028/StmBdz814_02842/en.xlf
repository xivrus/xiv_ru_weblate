The reason for his initial panic is made clear when he reveals that he is, in fact, a centurion of the Garlean forces. He ordered his men to retreat in lieu of a crushing defeat at the hands of the Alliance, but ran into an unexpected problem when attempting to turn himself in. To better explain his predicament, he insists you speak with the people of Ala Ghiri and hear what they have to say of him.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ814_02842_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You speak with the people of Ala Ghiri, and their responses are not what one would expect.
