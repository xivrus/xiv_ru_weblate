Wawalago can only assume the river has some connection with the shooting stars' disappearance from La Noscean waters, but he is worried for the beastman's safety in distant lands where his kind rarely venture. He implores you to give chase after Govv to ensure that the spirited Sahagin does not get into trouble. Before that, however, the two of you decide to make for Pike Falls to meet one of your angler acquaintances from Coerthas, whose help Wawalago has beseeched in the business of tracking down the disappearing fish.</target>

While her investigation has turned up valid insights into the disappearance of the shooting stars, Govv dismisses her findings as a fabrication, on the basis that shorewalkers like you and Reyna possess only a superficial understanding of matters of the sea. Seeking to give Govv a taste of humility, Reyna proposes a contest to demonstrate the full depths of your angling expertise. Reel in three deep Velodyna carp before Govv does to prove that you are as capable a fisher as he.</target>

With the humbled Sahagin now offering a more receptive ear, Reyna elaborates on her findings, that the Sahagins' so-called shooting stars are likely the same schools of migratory fish that can be found further east, although the actual location of their spawning beds remains unknown. As she seeks further information from fishers in the region, she asks you to relay the news in full to Guildmaster Wawalago.</target>
