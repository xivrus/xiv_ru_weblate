On the contrary, he has simply been going out to converse with a companion who seeks his counsel─a companion who, he expresses, might be eager to meet you as well. He asks you to assure Sisipu that all is well, then join him and his friend at the Gods' Grip.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSFSH601_02895_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Meeting Wawalago at the Gods' Grip, you are quickly joined by Govv, a young Sahagin who befriended Master Wawalago after ending up on the wrong end of his fishing line. Recently, Govv is gravely concerned at the sudden and surprising disappearance of a particularly striking species of fish known as “the shooting star of the seas” in the Sahagin tongue. With a clear vote of confidence from the guildmaster, Govv accepts your aid, and goes off to collect more information that could help you ascertain where the fish may have absconded to. In the meantime, Wawalago would return to Limsa before Sisipu gets wise to his current whereabouts.</target>

He explains that the girl's home was once raided by the Sahagin when she was young, and he seeks only to spare her from reliving the pain of her past. Stating his intention to seek out more information on the fish─such as its name in your own tongue─he encourages you to partake in a spot of fishing to further focus your mind on the task at hand.
