Taking his ring in hand, he plans for you to go about town claiming he is the man responsible for the death of one of the village's holy men shortly after his arrival. Before setting the rumor to spinning, however, he suggests gauging the reaction of a single individual. The victim he has chosen is J'dyalani.</target>
