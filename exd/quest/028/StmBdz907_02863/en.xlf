Erart assumed the identity of a wealthy Ala Mhigan merchant's son in order to infiltrate the Garleans' army. After a recent clash with the Allied forces, however, they lost contact with him. Assuming the worst, the captain was prepared to deliver a letter to his mother, penned by Erart in the event of his death. Having come so far for answers, the captain feels it appropriate that you take the letter to Berehta.</target>
