When you explain that the Alliance had no intentions of executing him, he scoffs at their offer of clemency, claiming he would find another way to end his life. J'dyalani pleads with him to reconsider, reminding him that the people of Ala Ghiri care a great deal about him. As he continues to lament that he has nothing left to live for, she surprises him with what sounds oddly like a profession of love. Baut is so taken aback he can only laugh in response. The mood now lightened, he concedes to your requests and agrees to speak with the Alliance, granted J'dyalani helps him explain to the villagers he will not be put to death. As you all return to Ala Ghiri, you decide to pay a visit to Brazen Brook to share with him the good news.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ817_02845_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Brazen Brook is equal parts relieved and ecstatic to see that Baut has agreed to turn himself in.
