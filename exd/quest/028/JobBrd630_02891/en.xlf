				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBBRD630_02891_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;At Sanson's insistence, Nourval reveals that the tome rests in a place connected to Gylbarde, the renowned general who led the Ala Mhigan forces during the Autumn War. Putting two and two together, Guydelot suggests that the bandits may also be after the tome. The possibility seems to rattle Nourval, who excuses himself in spite of Sanson's protests. At this time, Guydelot reveals that Nourval has been stealing out of the castrum while your backs are turned. Sanson decides to allow Nourval to act freely in order to learn his true purpose, and bids you stand at the ready for whatever may come to pass.

※The next bard quest will be available from Sanson upon reaching level 65.</target>
