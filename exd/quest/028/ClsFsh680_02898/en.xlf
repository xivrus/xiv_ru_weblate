Unable to contain his eagerness to meet the lovely lass with a passion for all things piscine, the guildmaster also states his intentions to steal away from the watchful eye of Sisipu and join you.

Ansaulme relates their findings, such as they are: to wit, that they could determine no anomalies with the waters of the Ruby Sea from the specimens you secured. When the guildmaster then surmises that this could only mean that the problem can be traced to their spawning grounds, Ansaulme is impressed by his powers of deduction, encouraging Wawalago to travel to the Far East to investigate for himself. As the guildmaster hems and haws, Sisipu appears, chastising him for his insensitivity to her true feelings and giving him her blessings to make the journey eastward. You make for the fishing village of Isari to gather what information you can in advance of the guildmaster's arrival in Kugane.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSFSH680_02898_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;In Isari, an elderly fisherman by the name of Jisho shares with you an intriguing bit of history. Before the Garleans came, the Isari fishermen joined with their Kojin friends to hold a yearly event known as the Wadatsumi festival. The festivities involved catching fearsome sea beasts known as giant plesiosaurs and offering them in tribute to the kami of the seas, that calm might return to the oceans. Traditional religious practices, however, were outlawed twenty-five years ago when the Garleans came, and the bonds of friendship between Isari and the Kojin gradually faded away. You set off for Kugane to share this enlightening information with Master Wawalago.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSFSH680_02898_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Upon hearing your tale, Master Wawalago quickly deduces that the outlawing of the festival has resulted in an overpopulation of plesiosaurs, who doubtless are preying upon harutsuge hatchlings before they can reach full size. As such, it would stand to reason that reviving the festival would restore the harutsuge to the seas. Together with your companions, you make for the shores near Namai to catch yourselves some dafangshi, that you might present them to the Kojin in return for their cooperation in bringing back the festivities of old.</target>
