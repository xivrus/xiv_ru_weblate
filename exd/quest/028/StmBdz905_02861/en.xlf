With the threat of the imperials gone, however, she is hoping he will someday return. Daunted by the dangers of the world outside Coldhearth, she asks you to inquire after him in her stead. She suggests stopping in Radiata, where he likely passed through on his escape to freedom.</target>

Godafre goes on to say he and an acquaintance smuggled him north past Specula Imperatoris, but he knows not what happened next. With no other information to be had, you return to Coldhearth to let Berehta know her son seems to have fled to safety.</target>
