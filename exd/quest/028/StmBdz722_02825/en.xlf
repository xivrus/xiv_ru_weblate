As he finds the strength to stand and take his leave, M'rahz Nunh stops him to ask why he is so insistent on becoming nunh. M'zhet Tia accuses him of stealing the title from his father, after which they were forced to leave the tribe when he was a child. He goes on to say his father abandoned him, and believes it would not have happened if not for M'rahz Nunh. The M tribe leader is shocked to hear all of this, as he had not seen M'zhet Tia or his father since they left the tribe all those years ago. He claims M'zhet Tia's father relinquished the title willingly, but is bewildered as to why he would abandon his son. He asks to take M'zhet Tia with you and investigate M'aht Nunh's disappearance.</target>
