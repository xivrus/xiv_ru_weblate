I have some large hemp sacks you can use to drag them back here. Just be sure to tire them out a bit beforehand─any fight left in them and they'll rip right through the sack with those spiky tails of theirs.</target>

Well, just between you and me, we're planning on using the yabbies as a secret weapon to disrupt imperial military camps.
