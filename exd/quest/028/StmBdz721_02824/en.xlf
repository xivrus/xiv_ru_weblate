While most would find these duels to be an annoyance, M'rahz Nunh sees this persistence as admirable. That is why he asks you to train this would-be warrior. He says your new student can be found idling about Virdjala.</target>

Before you begin training him, he wishes to observe your fighting form, suggesting you pit yourself against a gazelle. To that end, he sets off in search of your prey.</target>
