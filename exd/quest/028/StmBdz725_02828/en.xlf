In light of this news, their strange behavior in recent days has left M'rahz Nunh concerned. He asks that you travel to East End and see if the Qalyana are up to no good.</target>

An Ananta of the Qalyana was trying to catch you unawares, but was thwarted by M'zhet Tia. He comes bearing more ill news from the Vira. As he explains it, the Qalyana were using a strange fruit found in East End to drive the wildlife into a frenzy to drive the M tribe from their village. Having recently discovered another container of Black Rose, Lieutenant Molkoh surmises the chemicals within have leaked into the soil, contaminating the tree and the fruit that grows from its branches. M'zhet decides to take the Ananta back to the Peering Stones for questioning, while Lieutenant Molkoh means to call in soldiers to dispose of the contaminated container. M'rahz Nunh will certainly wish to know of what transpired here.</target>

With his people safe, and M'zhet Tia following in his father's footsteps, M'rahz Nunh is certain the future of the M tribe has never been brighter.</target>
