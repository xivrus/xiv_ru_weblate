As the young scholar explains it, he had sent documents outlining his research to a renowned authority of arcane magicks, who has seen fit to favor him with a response. Eager though he is to know what wisdom they have to share, he cannot neglect his present work. He asks that you precede him and meet with Rowena in Idyllshire.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL520_02403_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Ardashir bursts onto the scene, breathless from an unexpected and hasty return to Azys Lla before finally arriving in Idyllshire. He quickly regains his composure, that he might pore over the sage words of the scholar─who is revealed to be none other than the legendary Matoya. Though her missive is marked with praise for his work, it is not without criticism. To wit, she has reason to believe that Ardashir's approach thus far may have failed to instill the anima with a sufficient sense of individuality. Based on his writings, she has offered a proposal to rectify this issue. And so he returns to Azys Lla to tell Gerolt of the good news.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBREL520_02403_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Little to your surprise, Ardashir's unbridled enthusiasm to resume his work is matched only by Gerolt's loathing and desire for rest.
