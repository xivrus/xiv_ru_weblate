Along with a new set of directives, he decides to send a trustworthy individual to join her in Kugane in order to keep her on track. That individual is you.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK630_02442_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You come across Cemi in the company of a distraught woman. Turning sheepishly to you, she begins to explain what happened, but is quickly cut off. As the lady before her tells it, owing to her plain features, she is always overlooked by everyone she meets and suffers from severe self-confidence issues. When Cemi approached her with the offer of help, she thought it a chance to finally overcome the sad hand life dealt her...only to have the apprentice fiddle with her tools without trying to listen. Ashamed at the unnecessary anguish she has caused, Cemi promises to find a way to fix her problem. Certain that the Mujikoza actors hold the key to standing out from a crowd, she asks that you go and interview them while she escorts the woman to the nearby Shiokaze Hostelry.</target>

This knowledge should be worth sharing with Cemi, who awaits you at the Shiokaze Hostelry.</target>

Allowing her easy access to all her brushes and powders, it is apparently the best remedy for a broken spirit. Craft a high-quality lavish dressing case and deliver it to the lady.

She tells you of how she intends to train in the upcoming days and weeks to elevate her skills. Hoping that you will join in on her quest to improve her woodworking prowess, she suggests you also take up the saw and hammer and build upon your current skill set. You part ways, promising to come back together to assist the people of Kugane in their furniture-related plights when you deem yourselves ready to do so.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Cemi upon reaching level 65.</target>
