Having subsequently risen to a position of responsibility, he has been tasked with finding new recruits, and wishes to pay a visit to the village of Ala Gannha─Lyse's birthplace. Upon learning of this, she insists that she be allowed to accompany you, and Meffrid sees no reason to deny her.</target>
