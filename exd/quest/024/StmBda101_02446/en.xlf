Yet if the Alliance must go to war, it would not do so alone. General Raubahn Aldynn has asked that the Scions of the Seventh Dawn secure the support of the Ala Mhigan Resistance, that they might join forces with the Alliance and drive the legions of Garlemald from Eorzea once and for all. This formal request for aid was not unanticipated, and you and your fellow Scions take little time to reach a consensus. To Ala Mhigo you will go─with Lyse to lead the way, given her ties to the Resistance.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA101_02446_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;As you are preparing to leave the Rising Stones, you are met by Yugiri and Gosetsu.
