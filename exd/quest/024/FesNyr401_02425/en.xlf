        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR401_02425_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Upon the decks of Limsa Lominsa, you are fairly pounced upon by the inu bugyo, who relates to you his mission to foster the bonds of friendship between Eorzea and the Far East. To this end, he is hosting a Heavensturn celebration in the Far Eastern style, and requests your help in spreading the word. Aiding you in this task is Taro, a dog as clever as he is cute, who will give the locals a taste of the spectacle to come. No sooner is Taro introduced than he rushes off, eager to find crowds to please, and you spin on your heels after him.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR401_02425_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;The third time proves to be a curse; you are shocked to find Taro not being doted upon, but snarled at by a menacing dog and its equally menacing owner. The obnoxious man claims to belong to a band of pirates called the Rabid Wives, and makes his dislike of Taro abundantly plain, sending your canine companion scurrying away in fear. Though a part of you yearns to teach the brute a lesson in humility, you decide to give priority to Taro and report the incident to his master.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR401_02425_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Shaken as Taro is, the inu bugyo fears he is in no state to perform. Even as it seems the festival must proceed with only advent cakes, the mochi daikan returns with grave tidings: the Rabid Wives have disrupted the mochi pounding by unleashing their deckhounds. As you make to hasten to the mochi's rescue, Taro lets out a beseeching whine; for all his trauma, he still wishes to be of help. And so you strike out together to save the festival, by participating in the FATE “Who Let the Hounds Out” in one of the following locations: southeast of the Zephyr Gate in middle La Noscea; east of the Salt Strand in lower La Noscea.</target>

Alas, the Rabid Wives are not yet finished with their villainy, and they appear once more to disrupt the proceedings. This time, however, Taro refuses to be cowed, and he courageously confronts his deckhound nemesis. The sight of the little fellow standing up to a foe many times his size lights a fire in the hearts of festival participants, who band together to drive away the pirates. Upon seeing this display of unity between Eorzeans and Far Easterners, the mochi daikan declares this Heavensturn celebration a great success. As a token of his appreciation, the inu bugyo presents you with an inu kabuto, and you promise to rise to the mochi's defense again should the need arise.</target>
