Yet you have grown stronger since last you met, and for a time it seems as though you may have a chance...until your foe elects to bring a new katana to bear against you. At once, his body begins to crackle with a crimson energy, which bursts forth and fells both Yugiri and the viceroy's few remaining soldiers.

Discarding his damaged helmet, he implores you to live on, to endure, to grow stronger, and to face him once more, before whirling about and putting an end to a last desperate attempt by Yugiri to kill him. He advances to finish her off, but pauses when confronted by a group of armed villagers, as well as Gosetsu and Alisaie, who are determined to save the ninja's life. It is a touching display of defiance, but having tasted the viceroy's might, you know that even with such numbers, they do not stand a chance. Nevertheless, Zenos withdraws without a word, leaving you and your comrades free to withdraw to safety.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="5" approved="yes"><source>5</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA322_02498_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;It would seem that Yugiri owes her preservation to one Alphinaud Leveilleur, for it was he who convinced the others to rush to your defense.
