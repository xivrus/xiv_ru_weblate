Coaxed by Sylphie's gentle words, the girl then tells you her name─Gatty─and that she and her mother live in the borderland forest. Before Sylphie can tend to her wounds, however, you are both distracted by another surge of power, and look back to find that Gatty has disappeared. Convinced that the girl and her potent aura are connected to the disturbance, Sylphie suggests that a report to Brother E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Sumi&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Yan is in order.</target>

He surmises that Gatty's uncontrolled aetherial gifts are likely acting as a beacon for marauding voidsent─the presence of the malevolent creatures subsequently agitating the elementals. Return to Castrum Oriens once more, and help Sylphie with her plan to question the elusive girl at her forest home.</target>
