        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWVR700_02435_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With no small degree of pride, Master Keimei informs you that Kotocho has risen from the ashes and reclaimed her former position of geiko, having completed her second apprenticeship in record time. Furthermore, in recognition of her efforts, she has received an invitation to perform at the annual Kugane-odori, known as the event where stars of the flower district are made. Not all is well, however─as Keimei tells it, his butterfly is acting curiously despondent despite the joyous news, going so far as to refuse his offer to commission a new dress for her to commemorate the occasion. At the young master's behest, you make for the flower district in hopes of finding out what troubles the girl and easing her heart as best you can.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWVR700_02435_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;A brief heart-to-heart with Kotocho sheds light upon the nature of her plight. The girl tearfully describes how her sole source of comfort as she toiled and struggled was her dream that she would once again stand on the same stage as Kototsuru, and finally prove her worth to her mentor and role model. Though the butterfly has risen back through the ranks, Kototsuru's impending marriage and retirement from the flower district means this dream will not come to be. Unable to summon the passion she once had, Kotocho asks to be left alone with her thoughts. At a loss, you acquiesce to the girl's request and head back to share what you have learned with Master Keimei.</target>

As Kotocho's patron, he reaffirms his vow to support the girl in this, her time of greatest need. To that end, he would take it upon himself to convince Kototsuru to put off her planned retirement until after she has taken part in one final performance.

She does, however, set one absolute condition: the two geiko must perform the same number─an ancient Doman dance known as the tennyo-no-mai, or descent of the angel─while wearing identical dresses, which you are to fashion. Believing this the only way to raise Kotocho's spirits, the two of you thank Kototsuru for her kindness before returning to Daitenya to prepare the ancient garment─the tennyo hagoromo─needed for the occasion.</target>

It would seem all are eager to see past, present, and future come together on the stage at the Kugane-odori. You take your needle in hand, vowing to create twin masterpieces worthy of the grand occasion.

You wake from this otherworldly dream to welcome the two, who thank you profusely for crafting the garments so sublime it was as if they were truly transformed into heavenly beings. They share a moment of tenderness as Kotocho thanks her mentor for all that she has done, and Kototsuru entrusts the future of the flower district to her erstwhile apprentice. You and Keimei look on warmly as the two geiko reaffirm a bond that will surely last for the rest of their lives, even as their paths diverge.</target>

Kotocho will assume her place atop the ranks of the geiko, where she will lead the flower district into a new era. Great changes are coming, no doubt, but I am confident my butterfly is up to the task. After that ethereal performance, word has it all in the Hanamachi feel the same.</target>
