Furthermore, in recognition of her efforts, she has received an invitation to perform at the annual Kugane-odori, known as the event where stars of the flower district are made. Not all is well, however─as Keimei tells it, his butterfly is acting curiously despondent despite the joyous news, going so far as to refuse his offer to commission a new dress for her to commemorate the occasion.

The girl tearfully describes how her sole source of comfort as she toiled and struggled was her dream that she would once again stand on the same stage as Kototsuru, and finally prove her worth to her mentor and role model. Though the butterfly has risen back through the ranks, Kototsuru's impending marriage and retirement from the flower district means this dream will not come to be. Unable to summon the passion she once had, Kotocho asks to be left alone with her thoughts.
