When presented with Alphinaud's masterful sketch, the few who do not refuse to answer your questions outright will tell you only that they turned the Roegadyn samurai away. Defeated, Lyse is poised to return to the Ruby Bazaar before remembering a final name on the list provided by Hancock: Gyodo, a Namazu said to frequent the Shiokaze Hostelry.</target>

He is more than willing to do the same for you, provided you can pay an exorbitant and undisclosed price. Though eager to proceed, Lyse says she needs time to consult with the others, and Gyodo duly agrees. He warns you to hurry, however, as all must be arranged by nightfall.</target>

All seems lost until a mysterious Kojin appears and bids you hide while he directs your pursuers to another part of the city. Your path now clear, you return to Hancock, and at last learn the identity of your savior: Soroban, a Kojin of the Blue. The jovial beastman duly confesses that he did not aid you wholly out of the kindness of his heart. A merchant by trade, he seeks to broker an agreement with Hancock, who is more than happy to do so. All the while, the unconscious Gyodo that Lyse carried on her shoulder to the Ruby Bazaar twitches...but you will have your answers from him soon enough.</target>

The Kojin language has many similarities with ancient Hingan, you see, and in ancient Hingan, the word for green, “ao,” can mean green and or blue─though I do the word a disservice by even attempting to translate it, so steeped in meaning as it is. Why they elected to keep on calling themselves the “blue” in modern times is anyone's guess─I for one would have much preferred “Kojin of the Ao”─but one theory posits that they prefer the sound of the word “blue” when spoken. Another is that they are physically incapable of distinguishing between the two, which would have interesting implications in their everyday lives...</target>
