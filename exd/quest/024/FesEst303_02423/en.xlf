The creature was last seen making for the city; should it cause a commotion there, the blame is like to fall upon the festival. Nonotta bids you return with her to Gridania in order to alert Jihli at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre.

Dismayed by the prospect of violence, Jihli is determined to resolve the matter peacefully, and bids you reach out to the spriggan.

Jihli invites Riggy to be an official part of the festival, and together they head back to Hyrstmill.

Reflecting upon recent events, Jihli experiences an epiphany: the gemstone in her dream is none other than Riggy, who rode atop his magnificent rock and spread dazzling smiles to those around him. Grateful for your part in making her vision a reality, she spontaneously decides to gift you the eggshilaration system. Loath to part with her creation, Nonotta inadvertently reveals its secret, but much to her surprise, the truth impresses rather than upsets Jihli. After a tender moment, she undergoes a change of heart and gives you her blessing to be the proud owner of a hovering egg. May it bear you to all you have ever dreamed.</target>
