With the blessing of your guildmaster, you set off for the land of Hingashi, that you might forge yet stronger bonds with your new trading partner, and broaden your aesthetic horizons in the process.</target>

To that end, he would have you weave a dress in the Ishgardian tradition to be worn by a geiko─a Hingan dancing girl─who has struck his fancy. Head to Sanjo Hanamachi─the flower district─to learn more about the request from the girl herself.</target>

She reveals, under the condition of secrecy, that the idea of bringing Western fashions to her homeland was originally her own, though one that the young master was quick to adopt. She would have you fashion for her a dress in the Ishgardian style, with a butterfly motif to match the meaning of her assumed name, in hopes of rising above her peers and claiming a position of prominence in the flower district. Impressed with the girl's ambition and resolve, you make for Daitenya to procure the fabrics you require.</target>
