Moved by the gesture, her steely demeanor softens, and you sense that the rift between the two may have finally begun to heal. Alas, there is no time for further conversation, as Carvallain declares that it is time to depart.

The voyage is smooth and almost entirely uneventful... &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Almost.&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; On a day like any other, while conversing with your comrades and the captain below deck, the ship lurches violently. Moments later a deckhand barges into the room, speaking of strange things in the water, and a mysterious force dragging the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Misery&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; off course. With a sigh, Carvallain goes to investigate─but not before asking you to join him.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA139_02469_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Though he puts no stock in Sea Wolf superstitions and faerie tales, Carvallain explains to you that the “things” in the water his sailors refuse to name are the souls of deceased women said to lure sailors to their deaths. Though the very thought is enough to cause Alphinaud considerable distress, Alisaie flatly concludes that whatever the cause of your troubles, you have no recourse but to surrender to the current, let it take the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Misery&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; where it will, and deal with whatever you find there. Carvallain duly agrees, and the matter is settled. Once you arrive at your unknown destination, the crew will remain with the ship while your company proceeds ashore to seek out the fiend responsible for your troubles.
