As the guildmaster tells it, he has an appointment to meet a most promising new trading partner from the Far East, and he is confident that the presence of his most talented protégé─namely, you─would help the negotiations proceed even more smoothly. Seek out the young master of Daitenya in the markets of the Ruby Road Exchange, and do try to make a good first impression.</target>

He explains that he has traveled to this realm with his female companion in hopes of finding Eorzean fashions that he could introduce to his homeland. When the young man expresses concerns that the garb of the Ul'dahn dancing girls may not quite suit Far Eastern sensibilities, Redolent Rose suggests that he pay a visit to the palace ball, where he might find the attire of the visiting Ishgardian delegation more to his liking. The youth expresses his enthusiasm, and at the guildmaster's request, you agree to accompany your two guests to the Royal Promenade.</target>

Your new associates take their leave, expressing their eagerness to see the wonderful garments you will produce for them, and extending a cordial invitation to visit them in Kugane one day. Shirk not your training, that you might be able to share the wonders of Eorzean fashion with your friends from across the Ruby Sea.
