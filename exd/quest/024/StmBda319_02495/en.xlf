He tells the gathered people of the battle between Confederate and imperial forces in Isari, declaring it a brazen, unconscionable act that will not go unanswered. Announcing that some will be required to serve the Garleans in rudimentary support roles for an indeterminate period of time, the pilus prior begins to select villagers one by one, ending with Isse, the young man who implored you to leave Namai and never return. Powerless to intervene without endangering the lives of the villagers, you and your comrades can only watch as the soldiers depart with their hostages.</target>
