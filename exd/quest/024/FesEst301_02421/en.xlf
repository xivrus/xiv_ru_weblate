        <target state="final">TEXT_FESEST301_02421_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide, that most eggcentric of festivals, has returned to Eorzea. This year Jihli Aliapoh has seen a vision of a hovering egg, from which a chocobo emerges to startle people before going on to lay a magnificent, dazzling gemstone. If you would help Jihli recreate her vision, make your way to Hyrstmill in the North Shroud, where her friend and helper Nonotta awaits with detailed instructions.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
