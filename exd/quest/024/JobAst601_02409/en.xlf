        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBAST601_02409_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Leveva, daughter of disgraced (and deceased) astrologian Rufin, granddaughter of eccentric (yet powerful) Mace, came to Ishgard from faraway Sharlayan to preach the virtues of her homeland's school of astrology. However, forces in both the Holy See and the island nation of scholars to the north would work to prevent her from accomplishing that very thing. Yet, with your aid and (to a far lesser extent) that of the nobleman Jannequinard de Durendaire, Leveva is able to thwart her enemies and open the door for bringing Ishgard into an all new era of astrological studies.

A quick chat with Jannequinard reveals that Lady Leveva, now going by the name of her father, is currently awaiting your arrival at the First Dicasterial Observatorium of Aetherial and Astrological Phenomena.</target>

When visiting your old mentor, Leveva, the Observatorium receives a most unexpected visitor in Kyokuho, a traveler from the Far East. Kyokuho expresses his interest in learning the art of Sharlayan astrology, to which Leveva begrudgingly agrees to help─or rather, agrees to let &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; help by accompanying the man to Rootslake in the South Shroud where you will guide him in opening the gate to the first heaven.</target>
