Just as you reach for your coinpurse to toss him a gil and move on, he mentions that the Gold Saucer is currently hosting the Make It Rain campaign, an annual festival where guests have the chance to win magnificent prizes galore. Interest piqued, you make your way to the Ruby Road Exchange to find out more from the Saucer attendant.

Greeting you with all the flair one would expect from a Manderville man, he offers you a limited-edition VIP card bearing the stamp of House Manderville. His duty done, Godbert returns to the Saucer and the attendant instructs you to present your card to Ollier in Wonder Square.</target>
