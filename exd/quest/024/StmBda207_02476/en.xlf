Even after it became clear that the rebellion was doomed, it would seem the young lord resolved to remain and fight on with Gosetsu at his side. Alas, in the ensuing chaos, the two became separated, and the samurai knows not what became of his master─only that he somehow survived, and that the Empire still seeks to make an example of him. Alphinaud then explains your purpose in coming to the Far East, and Gosetsu is overjoyed at the prospect of returning to Othard with new allies. Yet it would not be prudent for all to continue onwards, and so it is decided that Tataru and Alphinaud will remain, while you, Lyse, Alisaie, and Gosetsu go to meet Soroban at the docks.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA207_02476_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Soroban has already seen to the necessary preparations in your absence, and is ready to depart Kugane whenever you and the others are.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA207_02476_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Before you lies the vast expanse of the Ruby Sea, so named for the shade of crimson it turns with the morning sun.
