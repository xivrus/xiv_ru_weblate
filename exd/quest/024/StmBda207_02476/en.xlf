Reunited at last, you inform your Doman comrade that you have found a captain willing to take you all across the Ruby Sea, but elect to save the details until you have returned to the Ruby Bazaar.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA207_02476_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;In the offices of the East Aldenard Trading Company, Gosetsu reveals that he and Yugiri parted ways some while ago, hoping to improve their chances of finding Lord Hien, the missing heir to the Doman throne. Even after it became clear that the rebellion was doomed, it would seem the young lord resolved to remain and fight on with Gosetsu at his side. Alas, in the ensuing chaos, the two became separated, and the samurai knows not what became of his master─only that he somehow survived, and that the Empire still seeks to make an example of him. Alphinaud then explains your purpose in coming to the Far East, and Gosetsu is overjoyed at the prospect of returning to Othard with new allies. Yet it would not be prudent for all to continue onwards, and so it is decided that Tataru and Alphinaud will remain, while you, Lyse, Alisaie, and Gosetsu go to meet Soroban at the docks.</target>
