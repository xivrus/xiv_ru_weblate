        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK601_02441_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Timbermaster Beatin is concerned about a young girl named Cemi who has been in low spirits of late. He has approached her on several occasions to learn what has been troubling her, but she refuses to speak to him of her woes. Believing she would be more willing to open up to you, he requests that you seek her out in front of the guild and ask what has been weighing on her mind.</target>

She tells you of how profits have been dwindling and Beatin has been working himself to the bone to compensate for their losses. Convinced he has pushed his body to its physical limits, she believes it time for decisive action. She then asks that you accompany her to the Carline Canopy, where you are to help interview the local citizens on the types of furniture they are looking to purchase, so you might come up with a viable solution to raise revenue.</target>

It seems people are enamored of the more traditional crafting methods and unique patterns employed in the items exclusive to these regions. Seek out Cemi and inform her of what you have discovered.</target>

To this end, she means to impress upon Beatin the importance of offering Far East-inspired furnishings, and asks that you accompany her back to the guild to lend your voice to this endeavor.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK601_02441_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Timbermaster Beatin is surprisingly receptive to what Cemi has to say. When she tells him that the guild needs to begin producing Far Eastern-style furniture to keep up with the markets, however, the discussion takes an unexpected turn, and Beatin counters Cemi's suggestion with an idea of his own. He says that he would like for her to travel to the Far East on the guild's behalf and learn the traditional ways of crafting oriental furnishings. Thrilled by the prospect, the young girl scurries off to prepare for departure, pausing only to say that she will send a letter when she reaches her destination.

※The next carpenter quest will be available from Beatin upon reaching level 63.</target>
