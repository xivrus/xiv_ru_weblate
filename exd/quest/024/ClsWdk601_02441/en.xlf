She tells you of how profits have been dwindling and Beatin has been working himself to the bone to compensate for their losses. Convinced he has pushed his body to its physical limits, she believes it time for decisive action. She then asks that you accompany her to the Carline Canopy, where you are to help interview the local citizens on the types of furniture they are looking to purchase, so you might come up with a viable solution to raise revenue.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK601_02441_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;By speaking with the people at the Carline Canopy, you learn that furnishings from the Far East are currently all the rage amongst furniture buyers.

When she tells him that the guild needs to begin producing Far Eastern-style furniture to keep up with the markets, however, the discussion takes an unexpected turn, and Beatin counters Cemi's suggestion with an idea of his own. He says that he would like for her to travel to the Far East on the guild's behalf and learn the traditional ways of crafting oriental furnishings. Thrilled by the prospect, the young girl scurries off to prepare for departure, pausing only to say that she will send a letter when she reaches her destination.
