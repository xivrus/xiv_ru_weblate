You make tracks for the Carline Canopy, to share some festive feelings with friends─although your method of expressing said sentiments may not be quite what they were expecting.

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESVLT302_02420_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Upon arriving at the Carline Canopy, you promptly set about blowing a barrage of kisses at your guildmaster of choice.

Nevertheless, you are confident the message was received and set off for your next destination: the Quicksand.</target>

You ponder this weighty issue as you head for the Drowning Wench.</target>
