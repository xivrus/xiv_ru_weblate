Quickly skimming through its contents, you learn that Cemi has arrived at Namai in Yanxia without incident. While she seems to be enjoying her stay there, a great portion of what she writes is dedicated to food. Perhaps it would be best if you were to depart for Namai posthaste and remind her of the purpose of her journey there─to continue her studies on oriental furniture.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK680_02444_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You come across a man by the name of Reizan, who was a chef in pre-imperial Doma. As the Garleans' grip on the lands weaken, he is looking to fulfill his lifelong dream of opening a restaurant. With limited funds, however, it has been difficult for him to acquire the furniture he needs. Cemi jumps at the chance to volunteer, adding that she would like to turn this into a competition between you and her to see who can better satisfy the client. Reizan does not oppose the idea, and requests that you make something to accommodate the dining habits of both enclave and country folk. To determine exactly what that might be, he suggests you speak with the local residents.</target>

A simple explanation quickly calms her, and she apologizes. Handing you the materials you may need, she leaves you to make high-quality ornate partitions for Reizan.
