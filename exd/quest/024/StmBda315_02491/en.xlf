Nevertheless, you decide to carry on and resume your journey to Yanxia.</target>

The acting viceroy waged an indiscriminate campaign of terror, marching into villages without warning and committing unspeakable atrocities in the name of rooting out “radical elements.” After a time, these purges ceased, but the memory remains, and with it the promise of punishment should the people resist. And so there is little need for imperial patrols.</target>
