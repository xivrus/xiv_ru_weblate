				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESPDY303_02401_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Ulala attempts to put on an air of confidence as she tells you in a quivering voice that she knew you would pick her all along. Thanking you, the future number one songstress of Eorzea then goes on to say she also appreciates your discretion regarding the incident that took place earlier in Limsa Lominsa that day. As she continues speaking with you, however, she seems to let slip a vital piece of information that was likely not intended for your ears. Fervently denying that the reason she has so concerned herself with pleasing the fans is because she is looking to start a solo career, Ulala fumbles for an excuse to cut your conversation short before rushing off. No doubt the royal seneschal is dying to hear who is to be the brightest star. Make your way back to the Ruby Road Exchange and let him know your Songbird of choice. 

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Having received the girls' costumes while you were away, he tells you that they are every bit as glamorous as he had hoped they would be.</target>
