Unfortunately, that effect was lost on Jihli, a result which has left Nonotta disheartened. For now, do your part in the festivities by seeking out three festival participants in the Twelveswood and startling them with the shockobo. Once you have three shock eggs for your troubles, deliver them to Nonotta.
