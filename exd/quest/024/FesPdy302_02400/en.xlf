        <target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY302_02400_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;After you agree to keep all that he tells you a closely guarded secret, the royal seneschal reveals to you that the three Songbirds have gone missing. He tells you that upon giving them permission to select the fabrics and dyes they wanted to use for their own costumes, they disappeared, and no one has been able to find them since. While he and his staff continue to contend with the impatient fans, he asks that you use your knowledge of Eorzea to find all three of the girls and see that they return to Ul'dah in time for their show.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY302_02400_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;After a bit of searching, you manage to find all three of the girls, each of whom were so wrapped up in their preparations for the performance that they had completely lost track of time. Thanking you for coming to notify them of both the current situation and the hour, they hasten back to Ul'dah. Your mission now complete, return to the Ruby Road Exchange and inform the royal seneschal of the good news.</target>

While he returns to assist the rest of his staff in dealing with the tumultuous crowd, he asks that you escort the three girls to the Weavers' Guild and ask Redolent Rose to make the Songbirds' costumes.</target>

Telling you he is a steadfast fan of the Songbirds, he says he would be more than happy to oblige your request. With little time left until the concert begins, he sets straight to work to create three glamorous outfits for the Little Ladies' Day stars. Considering all the pressure he has been under of late, the royal seneschal could surely do with some more good news. Seek him out on the Ruby Road Exchange and let him know the three Songbirds will be receiving their dresses promptly.</target>

Having spent time enough with all three to grasp their strengths and weaknesses, he believes that you will be able to select the girl perfect for the role.</target>
