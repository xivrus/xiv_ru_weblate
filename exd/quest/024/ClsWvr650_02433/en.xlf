				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CLSWVR650_02433_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The dress that you fashioned for Kotocho has clearly made an impression. To hear Master Keimei tell it, the girl is the new darling of the Hanamachi, and─despite her relative lack of experience─has received an unprecedented invitation to perform at the inaugural Kaiko-odori, a festival celebrating the opening of Kugane's port to the world. The young master is eager to capitalize on the opportunity, and would have you fashion for the girl a garment that will capture the eyes of the numerous foreign dignitaries who are expected to attend. Seek out Kotocho, that you find the inspiration you need to commence work on your next masterpiece.</target>

Resolving to once again do what you can to help see the ambitious geiko's dreams realized, you make for Daitenya to procure the necessary materials from Master Keimei.</target>

The girl has scarcely slipped her arms through the sleeves when the three of you are joined by Kototsuru, a veteran geiko who is less than impressed with what she perceives as her junior's lack of respect for modesty and tradition. With an ominous warning that the girl's fame is doomed to be fleeting, she walks away. Kotocho, for her part, is more determined than ever, and you and Master Keimei vow to redouble your efforts to see that her debut on the grandest of stages is every bit a success.

※The next weaver quest will be available from Keimei upon reaching level 68.</target>
