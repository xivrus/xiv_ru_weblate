Unable to bear the injustice, Lyse rises to intervene but is stopped by Meffrid, who tells her that saving the man would only invite reprisals against his family, if not his whole village. For a mercy, the Skulls' commander eventually orders them to stop, as they are needed elsewhere. Wercrata will live to see another day.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA125_02459_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;It sickens Meffrid to the soul to see his countrymen doing the bidding of the viceroy.
