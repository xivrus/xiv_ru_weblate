Needless to say, Lyse is reluctant to let him go, and insists that you follow the poor man─not to interfere, but simply to see that he makes it safely to his destination.</target>

The encounter soon turns violent, with the soldiers beating the prostrate villager while simultaneously berating him for defying the imperials and giving them reason to mistrust all Ala Mhigans. Unable to bear the injustice, Lyse rises to intervene but is stopped by Meffrid, who tells her that saving the man would only invite reprisals against his family, if not his whole village. For a mercy, the Skulls' commander eventually orders them to stop, as they are needed elsewhere. Wercrata will live to see another day.</target>
