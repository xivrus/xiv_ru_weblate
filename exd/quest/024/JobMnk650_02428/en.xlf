As a well-known face among the Pugilists' Guild, you have been tasked with delivering the invitation. Make your way to Ul'dah and broach the subject with Hamon.</target>

He issues a stern warning against reviving the Fist of Rhalgr, and goes on to reveal that Widargelt is in fact his cousin, Theodred, who was raised at the Temple of the Fist in order to spare him the King of Ruin's wrath. Theobald then leaves, but not before declaring his intent to rule Ala Mhigo with an iron fist. With the immediate danger passed, you may turn your attention to your comrades.</target>
