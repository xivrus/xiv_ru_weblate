He issues a stern warning against reviving the Fist of Rhalgr, and goes on to reveal that Widargelt is in fact his cousin, Theodred, who was raised at the Temple of the Fist in order to spare him the King of Ruin's wrath. Theobald then leaves, but not before declaring his intent to rule Ala Mhigo with an iron fist. With the immediate danger passed, you may turn your attention to your comrades.</target>

They are the selfsame crew that razed the Temple of the Fist: the Corpse Brigade. Trained in counter-monk combat, they served the King of Ruin as his personal guard─though personal agents of destruction would be more accurate. But when their liege fell, they followed in their turn, becoming overqualified bandits.</target>
