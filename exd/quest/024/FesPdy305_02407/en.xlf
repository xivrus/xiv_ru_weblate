Promising to give their performance her all, she then rushes off to see to some last-minute preparations. Your job, however, is still far from done, as there is one last person who must be informed of your decision. Make your way back to the Ruby Road Exchange and let the royal seneschal know your Songbird of choice.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY305_02407_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The royal seneschal is delighted when he hears that you chose Narumi to star in the upcoming show and is just as excited to inform you that Redolent Rose has made good upon his promise.
