        <target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY305_02407_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Narumi, while initially terrified at the thought of being the center of attention, quickly comes to realize that leading the group may be the perfect opportunity to help her overcome her indecisiveness─a habit which lands her in hot water from time to time. Promising to give their performance her all, she then rushes off to see to some last-minute preparations. Your job, however, is still far from done, as there is one last person who must be informed of your decision. Make your way back to the Ruby Road Exchange and let the royal seneschal know your Songbird of choice.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Having received the girls' costumes while you were away, he tells you that they are every bit as glamorous as he had hoped they would be.</target>
