Telling you she will do her absolute best to ensure a great performance, she thanks you for not only helping their ensemble through a few rough patches, but also goes on to say that she believes the time you spent together─however brief─was very valuable to her. She believes it has helped her to grow as a person and see her goals with greater clarity. No doubt the royal seneschal is dying to hear who is to be the brightest star. Make your way back to the Ruby Road Exchange and let him know your Songbird of choice.
