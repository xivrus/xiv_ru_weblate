Through a tale about his departed son, Erik teaches Widargelt that a man is defined not by his blood, but by the choices he makes. His vigor and purpose thus restored, Widargelt turns his attention to what must be done. He reveals his suspicion that Theobald is in fact someone known to him: a brother from the Temple of the Fist named Adri, whom he had long believed dead. If it comes to it, Widargelt stands ready to strike him down, and he asks that you train him and his disciples in the way of the pugilist, that they might defeat the Corpse Brigade. Make your way to the old training grounds and begin their training.</target>
