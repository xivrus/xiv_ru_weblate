From afar, you catch your first glimpse of Yotsuyu, the imperial viceroy, and &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Grynewaht&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; of all people, who seems none the worse for the trouncings you dealt him in Gyr Abania and Carteneau. To the disgust and horror of your comrades, Yotsuyu forces one villager to execute another, before having him shot for refusing to kill his own parents. Incensed, Gosetsu resolves to end the madness by surrendering himself into the viceroy's custody, reasoning that she will wish to question him thoroughly, giving you time to formulate a rescue plan. Despite your comrades' protestations, the samurai will not be swayed, and you can only watch as he is led away into the local tavern.</target>
