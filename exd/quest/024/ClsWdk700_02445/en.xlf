        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK700_02445_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The client who awaits you is none other than Gairhard. He explains that, ever since his unit's heroic victory over the Ixali forces, new recruits have been pouring in─the latest batch being a mixture of Ala Mhigans and Gridanians who took an immediate dislike to one another. In an attempt to promote harmony, Gairhard held a tea party, only for things to go terribly awry. Now tensions are on a knife-edge, and he has come to the Carpenters' Guild hoping you might have a solution. Beatin suggests that you and Cemi begin by talking with the new recruits at the Adders' Nest to assess what you can do to dispel the unpleasant feelings between them.</target>

You have heard one side of the story; it would be prudent to hear the other.</target>

However, instead of politely receiving the tea, the Gridanians looked down their nose at it. Incensed by this spurning of their goodwill, the Ala Mhigans now refuse to associate with anyone but themselves. Having given both sides their say, you may now return to Timbermaster Beatin with any ideas you might have to restore relations between the two factions.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWDK700_02445_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Timbermaster Beatin believes your idea of holding a tea party in Far Eastern fashion has merit, as it will provide the recruits with the necessary atmosphere to work out their differences. For such a tea party to take place, however, certain Kugane-style furnishings must first be made. As one of the two carpenters to have experienced firsthand the wonders of the teahouses in the Far East, it is up to you to craft them. Fashion a high-quality teahouse bench and present it to Gairhard.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Beatin.</target>

While Gairhard rounds up his men for another tea party, Beatin instructs you and Cemi to take the benches to Apkallu Falls and arrange them in such a way as to replicate the teahouses of Kugane.</target>
