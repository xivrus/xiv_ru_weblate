However, she is long overdue for her return, and U'tykha Tia fears for her safety. With a susurrous sweep of his tail, the Miqo'te suggests you head southwest on a rescue mission.</target>

Though she appears to be none the worse for wear, she reproaches herself for failing to complete her mission. Return to U'tykha Tia in Forgotten Springs to hear what he has to say.</target>

I sent her southwest to hunt anglers, but she is rather long in the returning. She should be back by now, even if she'd killed one, dressed it, and made a saddle out of it.</target>
