He bids you speak with immigrants, and discover their hopes for Forgotten Springs.</target>

Whether the incorporation of such changes will result in positive growth, however, is a question to which no one has an answer.</target>

His strain of foolish cheer can be catching, and I've found it wise to never become &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;too&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; happy. Happiness begets complacency, and it's only through discontentment that one rises to become more.</target>

Unlike U'tykha, the matter of who becomes the next nunh is one I take most seriously. Each of us represents a distinct vision for what lies ahead.</target>

Forgotten Springs is &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;ideally&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; situated to be the waypoint for trade routes across the desert.

It's jus' they couldn't find an inn hereabouts that weren't full up.</target>
