				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_GAIUSA905_00800_BERNADETTE_000_021&lt;tab&gt;Hmmm... Seems to be some manner of decorative button, reminiscent of those worn by the families of old, though I cannot claim to know its sigil. However, I can say with certainty that the white lily is a recurring theme in Gridanian culture.</target>

Of late, there has been a man who is perpetually seated at the bench by the ward's entrance. His name is Ursandel, and I distinctly recall seeing a markedly similar button upon the breast of his jacket. I daresay &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;he&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; can tell you a thing or two about it.</target>
