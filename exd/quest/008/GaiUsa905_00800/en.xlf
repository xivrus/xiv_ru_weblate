        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA905_00800_MIOUNNE_000_011&lt;tab&gt;Well, isn't this a lovely little button. The engraving is quite exquisite─artisan-level quality, I would say.

You will have to find the answer the old-fashioned way─by asking around. You could do worse than beginning with Bernadette, over by the aetheryte plaza. She has a sharp pair of eyes, that one.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA905_00800_BERNADETTE_000_021&lt;tab&gt;Hmmm... Seems to be some manner of decorative button, reminiscent of those worn by the families of old, though I cannot claim to know its sigil. However, I can say with certainty that the white lily is a recurring theme in Gridanian culture.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA905_00800_BERNADETTE_000_022&lt;tab&gt;Alas, I do not know who would make a personal sigil of it. If there is a soul in Gridania who does, it would be Ceinguled over at the Lancers' Guild. The woman makes a point of knowing all the citizens on a forename basis.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA905_00800_CEINGULED_000_032&lt;tab&gt;Wait. A memory comes to me. Of late, there has been a man who is perpetually seated at the bench by the ward's entrance. His name is Ursandel, and I distinctly recall seeing a markedly similar button upon the breast of his jacket. I daresay &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;he&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; can tell you a thing or two about it.</target>
