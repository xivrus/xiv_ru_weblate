Search for and recover any parcels that you find, but make sure that you are prepared to defend yourself if the perpetrators are still present.</target>

As this could be considered proof of heresy, Lord Portelaine advises you against associating with any man of House Haillenarte. As the lord talks of informing the inquisitors, the knight standing behind him locks eyes with you, in an obvious attempt to catch your attention. Perhaps you should take a moment to speak with the grizzled knight.</target>

On the off chance any portion of his shipment remains, I would have you travel to the scene of the robbery and bring back what you find.</target>
