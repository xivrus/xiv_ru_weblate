One of the bereaved wished to place upon the grave of his beloved a sprig of Althyk lavender. He strayed far, for the flower is sparse in these parts─and was grievously wounded by fiends.</target>

I pray you, banish the foul things. They were last seen to the east, near the remains of a goobbue.</target>

The Calamity shattered its native mountains, and it fled before destruction as a caravan flies before a sandstorm. Years, it wandered. We found it dying and received its memories.</target>
