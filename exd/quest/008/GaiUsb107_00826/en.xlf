        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB107_00826_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Speaking to Riridesu elicits a small diatribe detailing the woes he incurred in his attempt to open a shop within Forgotten Springs. Apparently, the nunh of the U tribe forbade the shop due to cultural differences. Business must continue, however, so the Lalafellin merchant has bid you deliver a package to Odinel in Byregot's Strike.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB107_00826_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You have delivered the package to Odinel, who goes on to bemoan the inconvenient location of Riridesu's shop. Though he is not alone in his frustration about the nunh's decision, it seems as though there is little to be done to change the U tribe leader's mind in matters of tradition.</target>

Would've been glorious. An amazing location. A string of customers lined up. A bevy of beauties about. But the nunh of the tribe, U'odh Nunh, up and forbade it. Just like that.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB107_00826_RIRIDESU_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Now, in a way, I understand it. The U kill or gather most of their own food, so they don't need what I'm offering. But surely, the nunh &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;has&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; to see there's more to his oasis than his own tribe. Prospectors, adventurers, Flames...we just don't live or eat as they do!</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB107_00826_RIRIDESU_000_002&lt;tab&gt;...But there I go again, getting on my soapbox. I might as well talk to you about something you &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;can&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; help with. Could you take this package to Byregot's Strike, and get it to a fellow called Odinel?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB107_00826_ODINEL_000_010&lt;tab&gt;Well met, adventurer. A package! Came from the Minotaur Malm, did you?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB107_00826_ODINEL_000_015&lt;tab&gt;Thank you most kindly. The Malm's a poky kind of place─small as the dickens, and all manner of isolated to boot. Makes it tough to get up there and give Riridesu the custom he's due. Right shame about the nunh's decision. A store in the Springs would have been a kindness.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB107_00826_ODINEL_000_016&lt;tab&gt;It's just a crying shame. And the worst part is there's no changing that old Miqo'te's mind─mostly on account of the fact he hasn't one.</target>
