Because the kobolds are stealing food everywhere in Costa del Sol, that's why! The tomato pies, the mashed popotoes, and now the headcheese to boot!</target>

And I can't stand here and do nothing about it, either, as &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;I'm&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; the one getting blamed for the missing eats!</target>

I've placed the meats the kobolds like best in these five sacks. Line them up along the pier to the north, and they should come scurrying.</target>
