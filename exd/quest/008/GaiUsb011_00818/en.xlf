My botanist's hatchet serves its own purpose well enough, but I'd hesitate to use it on anything that bites back. I would guess that your own skill at arms is more apropos for &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;this&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; situation.</target>

What boggles the mind wobbles the body, and before I knew it, I was nearly on my face and the lumber in my arms was scattered all over the bridge. Some of it must've fallen over the side.</target>
