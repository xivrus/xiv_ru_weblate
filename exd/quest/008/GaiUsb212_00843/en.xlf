        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB212_00843_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Shamani Lohmani has suggested that you search for a bottle of Bacchus wine. This popular wine was once abundant in Wineport, but most stores were destroyed during the Calamity. However, rumor has it that one of the resident vignerons may be keeping a secret cache. Speak with the vignerons and see if there is any truth to these tales.</target>

He also admits that he has a personal preference for the drink, as it rekindled his love of fine spirits and helped him to find a new direction in life. With both his plans foiled, the blind vintner begins contemplating how to best approach the situation.</target>
