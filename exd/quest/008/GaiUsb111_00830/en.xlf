To ensure that she has not been too wounded by U'khuba Tia's critiques, seek out U'kahzuna in the Minotaur Malm and inquire as to her mental state.</target>

One thing is for sure: armed with new focus forged by U'tykha Tia and a new weapon furnished by U'khuba Tia, U'kahzuna stalks a brighter future.</target>

I suppose I can hardly expect an adventurer to be loyal... But I &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;can&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; expect you to stay out of U tribe affairs─especially when they concern the training of our young rangers.</target>
