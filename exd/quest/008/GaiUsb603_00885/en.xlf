Having fled from snow-covered Coerthas, they are likely to be a danger to travelers. Idristan has given you a chunk of fetid dodo flesh to be used to draw out the beasts. Find a suitable place to set down the meat, and slay the jackals that appear.</target>

The Calamity has left Coerthas nigh uninhabitable, and the local wildlife have become more dangerous as a result. If you plan on heading northwest, the Quiverman warns you to be prepared.</target>
