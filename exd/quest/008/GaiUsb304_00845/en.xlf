In the meantime, he asks that you deliver a bottle of his own original wine to Drest, a man who saved his life several years ago. Though he does not know exactly where Drest now lives, he does know that the man sometimes works at the Raincatcher Gully docks. Speak with Rhitskylt and see what he knows of Drest.</target>
