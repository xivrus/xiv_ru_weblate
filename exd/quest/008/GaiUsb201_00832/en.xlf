Brayflox, his former quartermaster, was planning to deliver it to Costa del Sol herself. However, something appears to have befallen Brayflox and her people, and Wheiskaet would have you travel to their settlement and offer your assistance. Speak with Ozun Nazun at Hidden Falls docks to receive directions to Raincatcher Gully, where Brayflox's Longstop can be found.</target>

If you wish to obtain the final ingredient, you must first help the goblins reclaim their territory.

※Challenge Brayflox's Longstop with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point.</target>
