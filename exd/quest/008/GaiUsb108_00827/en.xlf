In order to forestall further maintenance, he has asked you to clean up three such piles of sand in the immediate vicinity. He has also warned you of the smoke bombs that may have burrowed into them.</target>

However, he informs you there is much and more to do, as the dangerous smoke bombs which surround the dig are often drawn in by the heat of the machinery. In order to keep the work site free of unwanted visitors, extinguish four of these fiends.</target>

Could you remove the three piles of sand right over there? You be careful as you go about it, though: some smoke bombs have burrowed into them, and they're none too friendly.</target>
