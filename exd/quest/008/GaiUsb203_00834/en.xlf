If that were not bad enough, Kuzai Tazai has informed you that the group is led by an even more fearsome creature. Providing you with a concoction that might be used to debilitate the larger foe, the Lalafell has bid you slay five of the snippers so that you might lure him out.</target>

Even &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;more&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; so because I could use your help once again. It's those quakes that started up a little while ago.
