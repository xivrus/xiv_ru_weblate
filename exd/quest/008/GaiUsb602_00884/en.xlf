Presuming it was not destroyed during the Calamity, he recommends that you elicit the cooperation of the astrologians at the Observatorium, who were doubtless monitoring the skies that night and possess information that may be valuable to the search. However, as Ishgardians are wont to turn away outsiders, Vortefaurt advises you to first offer your services to the soldiers who guard the Observatorium, as a gesture of goodwill.</target>

I could only watch in shock as it disappeared over the mountains to the northwest. If the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enterprise&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; wasn't destroyed during the Calamity, I'd wager it's still somewhere in Coerthas.</target>

But to obtain them, you would need to deal with the Ishgardians who control the region. I wouldn't expect much, though─the High Houses have long been concerned with their own affairs above all else. When Dalamud descended, they took shelter behind their gates, and even now they have little regard for the plights of other nations.</target>
