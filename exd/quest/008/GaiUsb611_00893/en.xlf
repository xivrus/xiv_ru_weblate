Would that this meat were for a feast to celebrate a victory! I hear the unbelievers grow bold, hampered as we are by the snow. I pray that we are not defeated by cold and hunger ere we can meet the dragons in battle.</target>

We are without the men we need to lay in extra supplies, so thin are we stretched by the terrors of this winter.

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB611_00893_SYLVAINTEL_000_060&lt;tab&gt;My gratitude, adventurer. The rocks upon which Ishgard is built are less stalwart than we could ever have thought, five years ago. There has never been such a time as this. The shadows gather with alacrity, and we must make whatever preparations we can.</target>
