It is a curious fact that while Ishgard may worship one god, they no more speak in one voice than those who follow the Twelve, as is right and proper.

Would that this meat were for a feast to celebrate a victory! I hear the unbelievers grow bold, hampered as we are by the snow. I pray that we are not defeated by cold and hunger ere we can meet the dragons in battle.</target>

We are without the men we need to lay in extra supplies, so thin are we stretched by the terrors of this winter.

The rocks upon which Ishgard is built are less stalwart than we could ever have thought, five years ago. There has never been such a time as this. The shadows gather with alacrity, and we must make whatever preparations we can.</target>
