It would seem these rites involve the spilling of maiden blood. Knowing that this madness must end, Ursandel bids you do whatever is necessary to stop Amandine from claiming another victim. Make your way to Haukke Manor, situated on the western edge of the Central Shroud, and seek a way in.</target>
