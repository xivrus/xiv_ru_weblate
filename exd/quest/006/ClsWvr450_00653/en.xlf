To that end, he has taken the liberty of changing Wawarukka's commission. Before you can proceed, you must first obtain approval from the miner. Speak with Wawarukka and obtain his permission.</target>

Convinced that all is lost, he flees the guild in a fit of despair, proclaiming himself unworthy of Kokomo's affections. Resigned, Redolent Rose states that if Wawarukka is determined to give up, then there is nothing either of you can do to help.

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 50.</target>
