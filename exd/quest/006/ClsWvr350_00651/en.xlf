        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSWVR350_00651_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;To compensate for his ignorance of Ul'dahn fashion, Wawarukka enlisted the help of his friends when preparing his new outfit. Alas, the end result is a veritable hodgepodge of conflicting designs, and your linen shirt is no exception. Unable to stop the miner yet again, Redolent Rose falls to his knees and cries out in despair, only to rise to his feet moments later and excuse himself. Though it is likely a futile effort, you can only assume he wishes to pretend that the preceding events simply never occurred...

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 40.</target>
