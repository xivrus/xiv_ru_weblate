It seems the precious stones can only be found naturally in Coerthas. Adalberta beseeches you to not do anything for which you are not prepared. In the meantime, however, you are told that Wide Gulley has something to discuss.

Wide Gulley was attacked by a monster and could not complete the order. While the guildmaster applauds your success, she cannot help but feel concerned for your recuperating comrade, who she says is deeply depressed.

Wide Gulley never got his twenty pieces, you see. As he went about his work, he lowered his guard and was attacked by a fell fiend.

More than the wounds you can &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;see&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, I worry for his state of mind.
