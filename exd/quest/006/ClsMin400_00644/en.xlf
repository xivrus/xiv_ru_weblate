        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSMIN400_00644_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You learn from Adalberta that Deep Canyon has placed an outrageous order for no fewer than twenty pieces of jade. It seems the precious stones can only be found naturally in Coerthas. Adalberta beseeches you to not do anything for which you are not prepared. In the meantime, however, you are told that Wide Gulley has something to discuss. Seek him out in the guild before making any rash decisions.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSMIN400_00644_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Somewhat expectedly, Wide Gulley proposes another contest─the first to fulfill Deep Canyon's order wins. Make your way to Haldrath's March in Coerthas, and there obtain twenty pieces of jade. Once you have the required quantity, present them to Adalberta.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSMIN400_00644_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Delivering the jade to Adalberta, you learn to your surprise that you have won the contest by default. Wide Gulley was attacked by a monster and could not complete the order. While the guildmaster applauds your success, she cannot help but feel concerned for your recuperating comrade, who she says is deeply depressed.

※The next miner quest will be available from Adalberta upon reaching level 45.</target>

And if I &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;have&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; to send someone, you've rightly proven yourself the best candidate. But you should understand how risky the endeavor.

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSMIN400_00644_ADALBERTA_000_022&lt;tab&gt;...By default, that is. Wide Gulley never got his twenty pieces, you see. As he went about his work, he lowered his guard and was attacked by a fell fiend. His wounds were such that it was all he could do to run to safety.</target>

More than the wounds you can &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;see&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, I worry for his state of mind. He saw you as a rival to surpass, but he ended up losing in a contest he himself devised.</target>
