However, Adalberta suspects that more is driving him than simply the sting of defeat. Concerned for his health, she bids you speak with Wide Gulley in order to learn the truth of the matter.</target>

Deeply ashamed, he has taken on a throng of tasks in the hopes of turning Deep Canyon's lies into truths. Unfortunately, he has bitten off more than he can chew, and begs you to fulfill an order in his stead. Make your way to Camp Bronze Lake in upper La Noscea, and obtain twenty chunks of electrum ore on your guildmate's behalf.</target>
