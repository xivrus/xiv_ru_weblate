        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Ever since losing to you in the latest contest, Wide Gulley has been taking on tasks like a man possessed. However, Adalberta suspects that more is driving him than simply the sting of defeat. Concerned for his health, she bids you speak with Wide Gulley in order to learn the truth of the matter.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSMIN450_00645_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Wide Gulley reveals to you that his father has been tampering with official records in order to enhance his standing in the guild. Deeply ashamed, he has taken on a throng of tasks in the hopes of turning Deep Canyon's lies into truths. Unfortunately, he has bitten off more than he can chew, and begs you to fulfill an order in his stead. Make your way to Camp Bronze Lake in upper La Noscea, and obtain twenty chunks of electrum ore on your guildmate's behalf.</target>

※The next miner quest will be available from Adalberta upon reaching level 50.</target>
