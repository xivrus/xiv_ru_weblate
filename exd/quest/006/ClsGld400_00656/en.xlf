Your conversation soon turns to the topic of the Jade Fox, a legendary thief and master of disguise rumored to have come to Ul'dah. Roroton urges you and your guildmates to be careful, as the Jade Fox is known to have a penchant for fine jewelry. Report to Serendipity at the Goldsmiths' Guild and inform her that the commission is complete.</target>

However, she states that you need not worry about any commissions made through the Goldsmiths' Guild, as she will personally scrutinize each and every customer. Whether or not her confidence is justified remains to be seen...

※The next goldsmith quest will be available from Serendipity upon reaching level 45.</target>
