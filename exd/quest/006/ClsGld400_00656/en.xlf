Your conversation soon turns to the topic of the Jade Fox, a legendary thief and master of disguise rumored to have come to Ul'dah. Roroton urges you and your guildmates to be careful, as the Jade Fox is known to have a penchant for fine jewelry. Report to Serendipity at the Goldsmiths' Guild and inform her that the commission is complete.</target>

Whether or not her confidence is justified remains to be seen...
