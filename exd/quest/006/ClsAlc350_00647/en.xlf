Considering the growing disapproval surrounding the guildmaster's actions and concerned for the man's well-being, the receptionist is initially reluctant to grant your request. He eventually suggests, however, that providing one of the guild's valued patrons with a fine-quality vial of hi-ether will generate the goodwill necessary to avoid further obligations for a time. Return to Severian and tell him the good news.</target>
