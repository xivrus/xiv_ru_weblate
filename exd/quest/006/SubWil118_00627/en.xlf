Of course, it's that selfsame simplicity that keeps it from becoming more of a priority for the Order. We can ill afford to assign adequate numbers to its keeping, just as we cannot charge the poor to bury or be buried.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="53" approved="yes"><source>53</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBWIL118_00627_AIRELL_000_13&lt;tab&gt;Yet that does not stop the many who come calling to see their dead put to rest here.
