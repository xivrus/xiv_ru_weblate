        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSMIN200_00604_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You learn that Deep Canyon used to be Adalberta's friend and mentor, but that something has driven a wedge between them. Though they do not see eye to eye on many things, Adalberta concurs with Deep Canyon's advice on the matter of equipment, and proposes materia as a means to augment your gear. In order to teach you about these curious crystals while giving you field experience, she bids you obtain fifteen fragments of grade 1 carbonized matter, a catalyst formerly used in the materia melding process. Dig for the substance around the De Nevelle Checkpoint in middle La Noscea, and deliver the required amount to Adalberta.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSMIN200_00604_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Adalberta explains that materia can only be attached to equipment by Disciples of the Hand, a process that once required the use of catalysts procured by Disciples of the Land. Due to advances in materia melding techniques, however, these substances have since become obsolete. Although this has led to reduced work for miners and botanists alike, Adalberta tries to be happy for progress.

※The next miner quest will be available from Adalberta upon reaching level 25.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSMIN200_00604_ADALBERTA_000_14&lt;tab&gt;By your confused expression, I take it you're not familiar with the stuff. Well then, I reckon a lesson is in order. Simply put, materia's a kind of crystal that enhances the properties of equipment it's attached to. The attachment process is fairly simple, but that wasn't always the case. Time was you needed substances called catalysts, and digging the stuff up once formed a healthy part of a miner's work day.</target>

To that end, I want you to try your hand at mining a variety of it, namely grade 1 carbonized matter. Fifteen fragments ought to do it. You'll have the best luck searching around the De Nevelle Checkpoint, over in middle La Noscea. Oh, and you'll most definitely need your sledgehammer.</target>
