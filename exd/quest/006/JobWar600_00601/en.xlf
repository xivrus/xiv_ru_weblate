Curious Gorge fights at a fever pitch, eventually falling to the ground in a struggle to control his inner beast. In the last desperate moment, he triumphantly quells the rising fury of his inner beast, at last conquering it for good. Then, in a futile attempt to break through the tidegate's mighty defenders, the Sahagin captain attacks with his massive seabeast, but they fall quickly before the full strength of two unbridled warriors.

With the Sahagin threat quelled, Storm Marshal Eynzahr informs them that the Maelstrom will move forward with its plan to train its troops in the way of the warrior, and that Maelstrom Command has requested that the two brothers be the first two to teach the fledgling warriors. Little by little, the dream that they carried down with them from their humble mountain village will come to pass, as more people of Eorzea learn the teachings of their ancestors. Curious Gorge, fueled by his new confidence, swears that he will master the techniques of eld, and promises a fearsome duel once you both reach the peak of your martial prowess. Take care not to neglect your training, lest one day Curious Gorge become the mightiest warrior in Eorzea.
