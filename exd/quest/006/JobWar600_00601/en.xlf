Although Curious Gorge remains doubtful about his ability to control his inner beast, the defense will require two warriors for it to be successful. Broken Mountain will not let you and his brother shoulder all of the burden, however, and he informs you that he will aid you with what limited healing magicks he has at his disposal. Speak with Curious Gorge for further details of the defensive operation.</target>

Wheiskaet informs you that the Sahagin plan to use massive seabeasts to overrun the tidegate, and that he will be joining you despite the wounds he suffered in his fight with the primal Titan. Curious Gorge, still overcome with self-doubt, asks you to once again dispel the fear from his heart with an inspiring /slap to the face.</target>

Curious Gorge fights at a fever pitch, eventually falling to the ground in a struggle to control his inner beast. In the last desperate moment, he triumphantly quells the rising fury of his inner beast, at last conquering it for good. Then, in a futile attempt to break through the tidegate's mighty defenders, the Sahagin captain attacks with his massive seabeast, but they fall quickly before the full strength of two unbridled warriors. With the Sahagin threat finally quelled, speak with Curious Gorge to celebrate this tremendous victory together.</target>

With the Sahagin threat quelled, Storm Marshal Eynzahr informs them that the Maelstrom will move forward with its plan to train its troops in the way of the warrior, and that Maelstrom Command has requested that the two brothers be the first two to teach the fledgling warriors. Little by little, the dream that they carried down with them from their humble mountain village will come to pass, as more people of Eorzea learn the teachings of their ancestors. Curious Gorge, fueled by his new confidence, swears that he will master the techniques of eld, and promises a fearsome duel once you both reach the peak of your martial prowess. Take care not to neglect your training, lest one day Curious Gorge become the mightiest warrior in Eorzea.

※The next warrior quest will be available from Curious Gorge once you have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”</target>
