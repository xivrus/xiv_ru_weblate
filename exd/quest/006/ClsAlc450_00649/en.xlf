        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSALC450_00649_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;It seems that Severian's long-awaited alchemical process has failed to yield the expected results. Without offering an explanation, the frenzied alchemist demands you bring him a number of high-quality concoctions. Create three extraordinary mega-potions─one of intelligence, one of mind, and one of vitality─and deliver the completed substances to the guildmaster.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSALC450_00649_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You have delivered the three mega-potions to the agitated guildmaster. After inspecting your superb creations and regaining a measure of composure, Severian finally explains the reason behind his obsessive research─he means to resurrect W'nahja, the love he lost to the Calamity. With a new batch of components in hand, the determined alchemist returns to his workbench to begin a new attempt. Once more, you are helpless to do anything but await the results...

※The next alchemist quest will be available from Severian upon reaching level 50.</target>
