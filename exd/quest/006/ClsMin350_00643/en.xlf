Being careful to avoid the fearsome creatures in the area, make your way to Hopeseed Pond in the Central Shroud, and obtain twenty raw amethysts. Once you have the required quantity, present them to Wide Gulley.</target>

Keep working at your craft, that you might be prepared when the next contest inevitably comes.
