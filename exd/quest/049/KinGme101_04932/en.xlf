So it is that you join hands with Oblivion, and immediately begin making plans to draw Zoraal Ja out of hiding. Knowing his deep-seated yearning to surpass their father, Wuk Lamat suggests striking at him when he grows weary of waiting and instead moves to invade Tuliyollal again. Until that time, you must prepare for battle by learning about the technology that empowers your foe. To that end, Cahciua offers to show you to Oblivion's main headquarters inside Everkeep, but first you turn your attention to Geode, who wishes to introduce his crew.</target>
