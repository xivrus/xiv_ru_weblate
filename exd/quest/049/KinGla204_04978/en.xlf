To prevent it from resembling the Hanuhanu's book, however, she recommends seeking out your components closer to Earthenshire.

※Minimum collectability rating for this delivery is 230. Delivering items with a rating of 470 or more will earn greater rewards.</target>

You learn of Movalpolos, the sunken city carved out by the Moblins in eras past, as well as the origin of the Moblins' respect for earthenware. The resulting binding reflects their pride and resilience, and Zemoweni is moved by your efforts to represent it. As he concludes his story, he questions Pameka on the tales shared in her family─to which she knows little of. Motivated by her thirst for knowledge, she resolves to investigate the matter in due time.</target>
