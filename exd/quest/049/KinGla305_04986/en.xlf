				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_KINGLA305_04986_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Halnaruk's discovery is that of a Pelupelu experiencing all the symptoms of someone who drank too much mezcal. Xeerol Ja sends the fellow on his way with a glass of water and lecture on the virtues of hydration, but not before he misunderstands her concerns as one of a physician. Halnaruk is all too eager to support the flattering claims, insisting that Xeerol Ja is every bit the healer she once aspired to be, but these words bring her no joy. She confesses that the reason she never became a chirurgeon was due to her utter lack of magical talents─an unthinkable handicap for a member of the Boonewa clan. She can never achieve her dreams because she is inherently broken; and with such a declaration, Xeerol Ja excuses herself, her head hung in shame.</target>

Halnaruk explains that kukuru beans are more highly valued than their pods since they create chocolate─but he vows never to underestimate a kukuru pod again. Both have their strengths, regardless of societal opinion. Taking his meaning, Xeerol Ja's eyes brighten and she resolves to keep trying, for the sake of her customers and for the sake of Xeerol Ja Juicecraft.
