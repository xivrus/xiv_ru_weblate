        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGLA104_04971_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You deliver the lightweight lanterns to Rral Soj. The peddler arrives before long to pick them up, and is thrilled to see her urgent order was completed in so short a time. Unfortunately, however, Papawni seems to have fallen into a slump, failing to craft even a single lantern. Exasperated, Rral Soj pleads with Papawni to pick up her pace, but this only seems to push the former potsworn beyond her breaking point, causing her to flee back to Earthenshire. Rral Soj appears shocked by her employee's sudden departure, and will no doubt need some comforting words once she has had time to process her emotions.</target>
