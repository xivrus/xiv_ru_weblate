You arrive in time to watch Zoraal Ja bend knee to a hulking shadow of his father─a shade which subsequently vanishes into smoke, revealing the elector of Mamook, Zereel Ja. The elector chastises the First Promise for attempting to obtain the keystone by force after being bested in battle, and for this violation, he is disqualified from the rite of succession.

Zoraal Ja has no sooner left the stage than Bakool Ja Ja arrives, a homecoming that turns sour in an instant. When he discovers Bakool Ja Ja has not only failed to make progress in the rite, but suffered defeat at the hands of Wuk Lamat, Zereel Ja banishes him, casting aside his own son as he might a broken tool.

Wuk Lamat refuses, however, stating that she must learn more about Mamook first. Hearing this, the woman standing beside Zereel Ja approaches Wuk Lamat and whispers that she wishes to speak in private...</target>
