In anticipation of this, Cahciua has left you with a program that will send your souls into its memory banks, where you are to seek out and stop Sphene. A virtual domain generated by her memories awaits, and dying there would mean dying in reality, but for the sake of the lives in all worlds, you must brave the dangers and see your mission through.

The Dawnservant thanks you for all that you have done for her nation, while the gleaner reveals that he has given up that calling, that he might fulfill his mother's dream of seeking discovery.

When first you set out in search of the legendary city of gold, little did you imagine that you would discover it to be a twisted utopia. And though Sphene is no more, her hopes survive in Wuk Lamat, who shall watch over her beloved subjects as they rebuild their lives. With the cycle of life restored to Alexandria, its people will once more live and die as creation had intended, with the legacy of one generation being passed down to the next. Thus carrying the memories of those you met in your heart, you look to the journeys still ahead. As you continue walking your path, you may collide with others and your steps may falter. But come what may, you find encouragement in the knowledge that the world shall ever be filled with wonders awaiting discovery.</target>
