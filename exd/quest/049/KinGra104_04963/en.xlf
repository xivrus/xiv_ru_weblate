Seeing no end to the crowd's badgering, you and Yaana break into a run in order to slip away.

The pair impart to you that their mother and father were hunters who died in the midst of one of their expeditions, and thus their elder sister, Eutrope, took it upon herself to look after them. Joining the Arcadion, she became a fighter, climbed the ranks, and eventually rose to the heavyweight tier, only to suddenly disappear one day─right before she was due to be immortalized. Having shown you a glimpse of their past, Yaana informs you the time of your next match is nigh, and so you depart for the Arcadion once more.
