Lovely, who is known to wield both poison and the pheromones of a queen bee to charm her enemies in battle. While Black Cat has some reservations about how you might fare in the coming clash, Metem has full faith that you will claim victory.

Metem suggests you find yourself a “second” in the meantime, which inspires Black Cat to ask if she can fulfill this responsibility for you. Since she appears eager to work with you, and you have no other apparent alternatives, you decide to accept her request. Now acting as your second, she reveals that her real name is Yaana.</target>
