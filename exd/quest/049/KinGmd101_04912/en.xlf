To that end, the gleaner bids you speak with the sentry standing near the gate leading out of the city. Once you show him your travel pass, you can be on your way.</target>

He wishes to see you safely to your destination, and so he asks that you wait a short while until he can prepare mounts for the both of you. To pass the intervening time, Erenville suggests going to the nearby town of Hhusatahwi.</target>

Two men step outside, one chasing after the other, and their heated exchange seems likely to escalate into violence until the timely intervention of a familiar bystander, Estinien. You and the dragoon exchange pleasantries, but he departs as quickly as he arrived, leaving you and Erenville to reflect upon recent events.</target>

To preserve the peace without having to resort to conflict, the Dustwatch was founded, likely at the behest of those who share in Koana's vision of a modern Tural. Knowing your history of solving problems through strength of arms, Erenville urges you to remain on your best behavior, lest you find yourself in one of their jails.</target>
