He states that he has been seeking its next star─you─to join the Ascension Arcadia Championship.

Your goal is to climb the ranks by defeating the respective champions of each tier and ultimately become the grand champion. To ensure the matches are fair, Metem requires that the souls of seven fighters join you in battle. Should you be victorious in your matches, he promises to set them free.</target>
