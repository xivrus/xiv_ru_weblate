As their duel unfolds, the King of Resolve reveals that it is in fact the Queen of Reason who has orchestrated the attacks in order to plunder life force for her people. When Sphene personally appears to confirm the disturbing claim, Zoraal Ja unceremoniously cuts her down, thereby exposing that she is an illusion projected upon a mechanical soldier.

As the battle continues to unfold, Wuk Lamat divests Zoraal Ja of his advantage by destroying his regulator, but he responds by unleashing his war fleet on Tuliyollal. However, his forces are ultimately repelled, prompting him to take drastic measures. Having cut down his own aide for another regulator, he gives the order for all civilians in Everkeep to be executed for their souls, leaving Sphene horrified. It is at that moment that Gulool Ja unexpectedly appears to plead with his father, but Zoraal Ja takes him hostage and places Otis under his thrall. The king then flees, but not before challenging Wuk Lamat to come to the summit of Everkeep, there to settle matters once and for all.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_KINGME111_04942_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Knowing that her brother cares not for others' lives, Wuk Lamat fears the worst for the civilians.
