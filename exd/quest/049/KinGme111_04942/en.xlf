        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGME111_04942_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Zoraal Ja is on the move once more, marching on Vanguard ahead of a second invasion of Tuliyollal, and you accompany Wuk Lamat as she confronts her brother. As their duel unfolds, the King of Resolve reveals that it is in fact the Queen of Reason who has orchestrated the attacks in order to plunder life force for her people. When Sphene personally appears to confirm the disturbing claim, Zoraal Ja unceremoniously cuts her down, thereby exposing that she is an illusion projected upon a mechanical soldier.

As the battle continues to unfold, Wuk Lamat divests Zoraal Ja of his advantage by destroying his regulator, but he responds by unleashing his war fleet on Tuliyollal. However, his forces are ultimately repelled, prompting him to take drastic measures. Having cut down his own aide for another regulator, he gives the order for all civilians in Everkeep to be executed for their souls, leaving Sphene horrified. It is at that moment that Gulool Ja unexpectedly appears to plead with his father, but Zoraal Ja takes him hostage and places Otis under his thrall. The king then flees, but not before challenging Wuk Lamat to come to the summit of Everkeep, there to settle matters once and for all.</target>

In spite of Sphene's crimes, Wuk Lamat offers to help her protect her people, and together you make your way through the district to deal with rampant machines and fiends alike. At length you encounter Otis, who remains under Zoraal Ja's control, and are forced to fight him. Sphene's fervent plea awakens the old knight just in time for him to save her from a marauding fiend, and together you succeed in defeating your fearsome foe. Sadly, the exertion proves too much for Otis's aging frame and he ceases to function, having valiantly protected his queen.</target>
