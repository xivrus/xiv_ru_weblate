        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With a special exhibition match against Wicked Thunder now decided, you can see the conflict in Yaana's eyes. Yet she quickly recovers from her thoughts, declaring that while Eutrope is her sister, she's your second. She once more reviews the neoteric witch's fighting style for you, and then wishes you luck in your upcoming bout. An electrifying clash is sure to ensue.

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGRA106_04965_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;The witch for a new age reveals a shocking truth: the extended use of feral souls causes an affliction called psychonekrosis, a fatal ailment which eats away at one's soul. Eutrope herself suffers from the illness, and seemingly wishes for Yaana to leave the Arcadion so she does not succumb to the same fate. The only cure, according to Eutrope, is the exceedingly dense soul of a person─such as yours. Metem suddenly arrives however, prompting the Arcadion fugitive to flee. The stylish commentator urges you to become the grand champion, that you may release all the souls in the repository without arousing the president's suspicion.</target>
