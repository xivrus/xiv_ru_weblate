She explains that she recently hired an employee named Papawni, who seems to have difficulty with carrying out even the simplest of tasks. Before realizing this, however, Rral Soj had accepted a hefty bulk order, and was in danger of not fulfilling in time─until you showed up. She asks that you find Papawni, who was tasked with purchasing supplies in Bayside Bevy, and bring her back to the shop.</target>

She shares the sad story of her failure to procure supplies for crafting a pot, explaining that in all her years as an artisan, she had never needed to purchase raw materials. Although initially dismayed that you were hired to pick up her slack, she realizes that another skilled crafter can only help her learn more quickly, and affirms her desire to relearn the basics. With her spirits recovered, Papawni bids you both return to meet the proprietress as she had requested.</target>
