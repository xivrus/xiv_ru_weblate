				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_KINGME114_04945_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;After an arduous climb that takes you past technology both extraordinary and disturbing, you finally arrive at the uppermost section of Origenics on Everkeep's eleventh floor. There you come upon a storage chamber for soul cells, but to your dismay, most are already spent of their contents─it would seem Zoraal Ja has wasted no time availing himself of their power. A sudden noise from behind causes alarm, but it quickly gives way to gladness as you make out the figures of Alphinaud, Y'shtola, and Estinien, who have entered the dome in order to lend you a hand. With your formidable crew thus assembled, you press onwards to the summit in search of Zoraal Ja.

Your immediate concern, however, is Zoraal Ja, who emerges from the blanket of clouds. A gasp escapes your lips when you see his tortured form, in the process of being twisted by the profusion of souls he has taken into himself. Wuk Lamat steps forward to challenge her brother, and thus begins the final battle between the siblings─between the Vow of Resolve of Tuliyollal and the King of Resolve of Alexandria─whose outcome will steer the course of the world...

Having told a teary Gulool Ja that he is free to embrace or spurn his legacy, he then breathes his last. As Wuk Lamat laments her brother's path, Sphene arrives and reveals that she still intends to plunder aether from other worlds in order to sustain the Endless, whom she insists are not dead. She takes up the object the king left behind, the key to interdimensional fusion, and sends it through the portal before closing it. In that instant, she disappears, having left you with the fervent declaration that she will stop at nothing in order to save her subjects─even should it demand that she become history's most brutal queen.
