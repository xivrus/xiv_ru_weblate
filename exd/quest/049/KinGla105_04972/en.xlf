        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGLA105_04972_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You speak with a despondent Rral Soj, who is still trying to process why Papawni left to Earthenshire so suddenly. You explain that the potsworn are talented artisans contracted by the Moblins, and she finally comes to understand Papawni's unusual behavior. Rral Soj herself once aspired to craft metalworks that would be recognized by all, but after being told by a Moblin that she would have to travel to Kozama'uka to learn under them, she decided to abandon that dream, and stayed in Tuliyollal to establish her store as the best place to have order-made supplies crafted in a timely fashion. Now intrigued to learn more about Earthenshire, and wishing to make amends with Papawni, she asks that you accompany her to the settlement.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGLA105_04972_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You barely arrive in Earthenshire before sighting Papawni, speaking with her former caretaker. Apparently the cheerful Moblin has already accepted a different artisan into their care, which prompts Rral Soj to encourage her erstwhile employee to return to Tuliyollal and work with her again. Papawni is reluctant, however, and with some exasperation, you hint that they may be able to compensate for each other's weaknesses. The Moblin picks up on this, presenting all three of you with the task of repairing their scales' faulty fulcrum. Rral Soj and Papawni are willing to try out this new approach of cooperative crafting, and so the self-taught proprietress asks that you speak with her once she's had a moment to prepare the necessary components.</target>

Rral Soj and Papawni are both in high spirits from discovering how well they work with each other, and after some encouraging words from the helpful helphand, Papawni expresses interest in returning to XRral Soj Metalwares. The proprietress herself is eager to work with the former potsworn again, and believes that together, they can craft metalwares of unequaled quality at unequaled speed. Yet they will need time to work out the kinks, and Rral Soj would have your aid until they have. The pair return to Tuliyollal, where you intend to join them.</target>
