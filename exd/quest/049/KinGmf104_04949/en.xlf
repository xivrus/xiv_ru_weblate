Having admitted that she had been an Endless all along, she offers to help with your mission to stop Sphene, but asks that you first consider a request of hers. To that end, she bids you join her at a place called Canal Town, which you can travel to from the nearby zip line station.</target>

Seeing the sense in her words, you agree to do as she asks while waiting for the Meso Terminal to become vulnerable. Before carrying out the deed, however, Wuk Lamat expresses her desire to meet the Endless, that she might better understand Sphene. Thus is it decided that you will speak with as many of the inhabitants of Living Memory as possible as you make your way to the terminals holding their memories.</target>
