Wihuwte, the deputy chief of the Dustwatch, is both the leader of the bandits and the mastermind behind this scheme. To bring him to justice, Zekowa proposes that two of you lure Wihuwte away to Hhusatahwi while the third remains to find these barrels. Erenville volunteers to stay and search, leaving you and Zekowa to keep Wihuwte occupied.</target>

He follows the voice a short distance to find a grinning Zekowa, who leads the deputy chief on a merry chase that ends back in Hhusatahwi. He prepares to arrest Zekowa, but in that moment Erenville arrives with a barrel full of the townsfolk's stolen possessions, and subsequently reveals the existence of the bandit's operation to a growing crowd. Accusing the deputy chief of being behind this criminal enterprise, Zekowa challenges Wihuwte to a duel, who is forced to accept. The ensuing altercation is over in the blink of an eye, and Wihuwte falls to the ground defeated.</target>
