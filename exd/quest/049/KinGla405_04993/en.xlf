        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGLA405_04993_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Uapyota accepts your delivery and apologizes for her rudeness before. She then reveals that Shunye has been living in Tuliyollal for fifty years, ever since the village of his first family was destroyed under mysterious circumstances. Upon hearing Shunye's age, Uvlo flies into a panic, insisting that he must make up for neglecting the proper respect to his elder. Uapyota suggests gathering saleable materials from Urqopacha, and Uvlo leaves at once, begging you to accompany him and share his hefty burden.

※Precious materials can be gathered at the Sunken Stars by miners, and Larh Tortoh by botanists.</target>

He then opens up about his past, confessing that he believes the cause of his former home's destruction to be a fallen meteor. Yet it appears Shunye has little to support his theory, other than fragments of blue stone he calls the Azure Tears. Although it is unclear how he intends to proceed, Shunye may soon call upon your aid to shed light upon a fifty-year-old mystery.</target>
