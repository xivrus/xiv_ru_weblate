There you are to dig deep into the ground in search of anything which might resemble the Azure Tears.

※Deep earth fragments can be gathered near Iq Br'aax by miners, and near the village of Ilyon Asoh by botanists.

※Minimum collectability rating for this delivery is 240. Delivering items with a rating of 600 or more will earn greater rewards.</target>

Although a somewhat disappointing conclusion, you and Uvlo lift Shunye's spirits by reaffirming your dedication to solving the mystery behind his village's fate. The apothecary agrees to move forward, but asks that you wait until he thinks of a better approach than to dig up the entirety of Yak T'el. In the meantime, hone your gathering skills for what is sure to be a challenging search.</target>
