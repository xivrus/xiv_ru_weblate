A moment later, flying warships emerge from its murky depths, and upon realizing that they are heading for Tuliyollal, you and Erenville hasten back to the capital. You arrive in a city embroiled in chaos, with mysterious soldiers in the streets slaughtering innocents seemingly at random. Once reunited with Wuk Lamat, the Dawnservant explains that the enemy forces appeared out of nowhere and attacked without provocation. Together with Erenville, the three of you make your way towards the palace, and there find Gulool Ja Ja locked in mortal combat with a transformed Zoraal Ja. The hardened warrior proves no match for his father, but through the use of an unknown power, he not only revives himself, but manages to deal Gulool Ja Ja a fatal blow.
