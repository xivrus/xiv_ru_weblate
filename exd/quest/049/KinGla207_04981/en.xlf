        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGLA207_04981_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;At Xbalyav Ty'e, Zemoweni admits his intention to commission Pameka again─this time for a book of tales from his homeland. His dilemma, however, stems from the fact that a written work may not properly represent a Tonawawta village that adheres to an oral tradition. Recalling the power of illustration, Pameka proposes the next book be one that incorporates different media to fully tell the tale within. With Zemoweni's materials from Xak Tural in hand, you set out to craft a binding worthy of his people's stories.

※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Zemoweni.</target>
