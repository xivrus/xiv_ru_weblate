A well-intentioned “Dawnservant” later, and she reminds you of how little she enjoys titles. You and your comrades are like unto family, she says, and as such, should call her “Lamaty'i.” Swept up in the happy moment, Wuk Lamat invites you to accompany her as she thanks her supporters gathered in the city.</target>

Wuk Lamat insists she has not prioritized them for purposes of acquiring celebratory snacks, but whether this proves true remains to be seen.

Mablu and Tobli provide updates from Urqopacha from alpaca health to commemorative discounts, whilst Linuhanu reminds Wuk Lamat of her promise to attend Ihih'hana. Wuk Evu, predictably flustered by Wuk Lamat's new title, eventually settles down long enough to offer his services as a tutor regarding the cultures and customs of communities in Xak Tural.

Wuk Lamat echoes the promises she made in her ascension speech to Gurfurlur and Zurmurwur regarding the Chirwagur, and while they predict change will take time, they are nevertheless optimistic. Meanwhile, Rakorok chats animatedly about cooperation and Fonjeantaine seems to have found inner peace.

The Xbr'aax Rax congratulates Wuk Lamat with all due formality, but there is no concealing the pride in his eyes. With an apologetic smile, Miilal Ja explains that Bakool Ja Ja left early, unready to face his new Dawnservant. Just as notably absent is Ketenramm, though it is noted that he has always been somewhat mercurial in his appearances.

Having spoken to everyone she could, Wuk Lamat suggests the two of you head back to the Winged Walk.
