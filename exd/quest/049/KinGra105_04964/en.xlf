        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGRA105_04964_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Yaana presents your next opponent, the Brute Bomber, who is the champion of the light-heavyweight division. She warns you that he utilizes the power of the bomb king, and will attempt to seize victory by whatever means necessary. Nevertheless, she is confident you will not succumb to his unscrupulous methods, and so you prepare yourself for what is sure to be your most heated battle yet.

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGRA105_04964_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;The Brute Bomber interrupts what should have been a joyous event, upset that he failed to seize victory in your bout. He attempts to tackle you, when lightning strikes the pyromaniac from above. The lights in the stadium suddenly go out, only to return moments later with none other than Yaana's sister, Eutrope─otherwise known as Wicked Thunder─standing in the ring. She threatens to take your soul, which Metem construes as a challenge. He has not the authority to permit such a duel however, as the neoteric witch's license was revoked after her disappearance. Conveniently, the Ascension Arcadia president's voice suddenly reverberates over the stadium to sanction this clash, and so your next foe is decided.
