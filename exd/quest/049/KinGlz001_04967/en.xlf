This endeavor is not to be without its challenges, however. In the interest of promoting further unity in Tural following the tumult of recent events, Ropli wishes to extend an invitation to the estranged denizens of the dome in Yyasulani. To that end, you have agreed to make the journey, familiar as you are with the people there. Shunye and Donuhanu are tasked with accompanying you, the pair champing at the bit to depart.</target>
