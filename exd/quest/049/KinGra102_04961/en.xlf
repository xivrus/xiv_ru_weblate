				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_KINGRA102_04961_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You are introduced to your first opponent, Black Cat─the very same prideful girl whom you met earlier. Metem explains that she uses the soul of Cath Palug, a legendary feline said to have fought an ancient hero of their world. Once utilized, her claws will grow sharp enough to rend steel, and her agility will be unmatched. You will need to remain on your toes if you are to come out of this match the winner.

He has barely finished his explanation when Black Cat emerges, frustrated that she lost to you. In an unexpected twist, she indicates her interest in learning more about you and your strength.
