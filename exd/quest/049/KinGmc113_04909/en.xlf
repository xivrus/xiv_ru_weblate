Comrades are precious indeed─especially when they can deduce the location of the golden prize one seeks. Krile shares her growing suspicion that the legendary city may be located in the forests of Yak T'el, and thus the group resolves to ask the now cordial citizens for information while replenishing their traveling supplies.</target>

All parts of the Ja Tiika Heartland have been thoroughly charted except for the Skydeep Cenote, the final resting place of countless young lives lost. Comparing Miilal Ja's testimony with those of Hunmu Rruk and Vorporlor, it seems all but certain that you have at last discovered the city's location.

When Wuk Lamat places her completed tablets upon the provided pedestal, the door opens, revealing an extraordinary room. Black stone and glowing lights seem almost Allagan at first, but their differences quickly outnumber the similarities.

A gate stands dormant at the far end of the room─but before anyone can comment on it, the Dawnservant's booming laugh announces his arrival. Further discussion of this latest mystery is set aside for the time being, as the impending celebration demands everyone's attention. Wuk Lamat has discovered the entrance to the city of gold and successfully completed the rite of succession.</target>
