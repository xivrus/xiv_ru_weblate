        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB904_00927_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Having heard of your desire to earn Lord Drillemont's trust, Haustefort proposes that you do so by helping him serve the knights of Whitebrim Front a decent meal. To that end, the cook asks you to bring him the meat of a mudpuppy's tail so that he can prepare steaks. He furnishes you with a bottle of cider vinegar, explaining that the locals believe it can be used to weaken the beasts─though Haustefort himself has his doubts. In any case, travel to Daniffen Pass and attempt to use the vinegar to slay a mudpuppy.</target>
