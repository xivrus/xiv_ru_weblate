However, it has now been some time since the outpost fell to the dragons, and he cannot vouch for the airship's preservation or even its presence. Though it may all be for naught, you have little choice but to search the ruins regardless. Make your way to the entrance to the Stone Vigil, which stands to the northwest of Whitebrim Front, and speak with Ser Nathelain to gain admission.</target>

Unfortunately, that piece is situated dangerously close to a vast sleeping dragon. Leaving you to keep an eye on the beast, Cid and Alphinaud sneak aboard the airship and begin preparing it for departure. It is at this moment that Lahabrea appears. After remarking that you of all mortals may well have the strength to defeat Garuda, the Ascian uses his magicks to awaken the dragon, and you are soon locked in a desperate struggle with the creature as Cid and Alphinaud look on.</target>
