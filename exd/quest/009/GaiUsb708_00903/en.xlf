I'm a sellsword myself, but I doubt this lot here rates that any higher than adventurers. But I can't complain─I have three squares and clean straw enough to sleep in, even if I moil all day for it.</target>

I tell you, coming west to offer my services was mayhap less wise than I thought. This is a chill that even a bowl of Mun&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Tuy soup won't cure.
