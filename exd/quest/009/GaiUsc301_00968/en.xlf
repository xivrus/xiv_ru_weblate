        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSC301_00968_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;According to Hedyn, ascertaining the precise location of the crystal at any given moment is difficult, due to the fact that it has been devoured by a notorious spriggan named Giggity. The creature has grown so fearsome that other spriggans, fearing for their safety, have begun to petition the kinder inhabitants of the Twelveswood for aid. One such spriggan recently visited Little Solace, and Hedyn suggests that you journey there and attempt to track down the wayward creature.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSC301_00968_HEDYN_000_012&lt;tab&gt;Permit me to explain. You are familiar with spriggans, yes? The furry little rascals that are wont to seek out ores and other stones? Well, one such creature with an infamously insatiable appetite has single-handedly devoured every corrupted crystal in the Twelveswood. Fortunately for you, these crystals take an eternity to digest─assuming they can even &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;be&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; digested─and I am reasonably confident that one still resides within his gut.</target>
