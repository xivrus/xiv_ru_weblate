The creature has grown so fearsome that other spriggans, fearing for their safety, have begun to petition the kinder inhabitants of the Twelveswood for aid. One such spriggan recently visited Little Solace, and Hedyn suggests that you journey there and attempt to track down the wayward creature.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSC301_00968_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Komuxio confirms that a spriggan did indeed come to Little Solace, though he is deeply concerned for the creature's safety.
