This stretches even the very elastic definition of an adventurer's trade, but the imprisoned madman excites your pity. Ferdillaix may know if something can be done.</target>

A mangy dungeon rat is no fatted calf, but give it to Boyle anyway, for heretics cannot be choosers.</target>

It does seem inconvenient that in exposing a man's heresy, the inquisitors also make him loud and more than a little mad. However, no good can come of humoring unbelievers or criticizing the inquisitors...</target>
