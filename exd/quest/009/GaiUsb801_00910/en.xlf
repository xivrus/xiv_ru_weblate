Uncertain what has motivated this dangerous excursion, Lord Haurchefant bids you travel to the ruined outpost, search for Lord Francel, and offer him succor if necessary.</target>

Though you have saved his life today, he explains that he will soon have no choice but to accept the judgment of the inquisitors...whatever it may be.

Unfortunately, your past visit to Skyfire Locks has become common knowledge, and the witness is reluctant to assist a foreigner who may have been consorting with an accused heretic.
