When you relayed this account to Alphinaud, he found several questionable details which he cannot reconcile. He asks that you retrace the path the inquisitor is said to have taken that night, and see if it sheds any light on this mystery.</target>

He claims he fell chasing a figure in the darkness that he saw outside the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;eastern&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; gate, yes? But the main road leads to the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;southwestern&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; gate.</target>

Moreover, he said he glimpsed a “silhouette illuminated by the light of the city,” which would imply that the inquisitor came from &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;north&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; of the eastern gate, not south.
But it cannot be so─that way lies naught but a deep chasm.</target>
