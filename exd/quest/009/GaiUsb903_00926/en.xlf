        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB903_00926_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Lord Drillemont scoffs at the missive from houses Fortemps and Haillenarte, which calls for the increased reliance on foreign sellswords. He rejects the proposal without hesitation, shouting that Ishgard need not rely on outside help to win its war against Dravania. Though Nivie will doubtless not welcome the news, you should probably share with her Lord Drillemont's response.</target>

Despite it being her duty to convey Lord Drillemont's exact words to Lord Francel, she is understandably reluctant to do so.</target>
