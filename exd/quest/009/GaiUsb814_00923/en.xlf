His relief is palpable and his penitence potent. Start the last leg of your journey and deliver the cherry brandewine to Edwyn.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB814_00923_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The convoluted tale of ceruleum shortage is well received by Edwyn, especially when you pass on the cherry brandewine along with Syntgoht's apology. Words are wind, but a costly bottle of nectar sets a great deal to rights.</target>
