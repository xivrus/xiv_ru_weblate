However, in its current state, it will not serve as bait. In accordance with Maerwynn's instructions, you must journey to Amberscale Rock in the Central Shroud, and rub the soulstone against the giant concentration of amber in order to dispel the enchantments woven into the chunk of true heart ore.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSC307_00974_MAERWYNN_000_000&lt;tab&gt;A chert golem was recently sighted near the gates to the Sylphlands. Who created it and why it was left free to roam is anyone's guess. In any case, the construct's presence is profoundly serendipitous, for the soulstone of a chert golem is created by enchanting a chunk of true heart ore. True heart, in case you were unaware, is an exceedingly rare ore, one which Giggity has almost certainly never tasted, and will therefore be unable to resist.</target>

Oh, and do remember to rub the soulstone against a sufficiently large concentration of amber, say, Amberscale Rock in the Central Shroud. Short of petitioning a mage versed in golem magicks, that is the only way I know to dispel the enchantments woven into a true heart. Eh? Why are you looking at me like that? I had relations with a thaumaturge once, if you must know.</target>
