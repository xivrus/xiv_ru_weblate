You learn that the White Rams are in fact a counter-Ixal levy, and on a personal level, Molkot appears to take nearly gustatory delight in defeating the birdmen. </target>

I'm Ireine, a tactical officer of the White Rams─and apparently a medic, for I find myself ordered to keep an eye on this lug. Oh, shut it, Isaudorel!</target>
