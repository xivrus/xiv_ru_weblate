You learn that the White Rams are in fact a counter-Ixal levy, and on a personal level, Molkot appears to take nearly gustatory delight in defeating the birdmen. </target>

I'm Ireine, a tactical officer of the White Rams─and apparently a medic, for I find myself ordered to keep an eye on this lug. Oh, shut it, Isaudorel!</target>

Miah Molkot's slain as many Ixal in battle as there are trees in the woods of Proud Creek. She can be...scary. Waste her time with maffles or bluster, and she might use you as Ixal bait.</target>

Extending the defensive line against the Ixal northwest into Coerthas will be no stroll through the wood, but ah, how the birdies will struggle in the net!
