Though he cannot provide a more accurate location at the moment, he is confident that, with the right astroscope log, he could calculate one. To that end, he asks that you bring to him volume six of the 1572 readings─a large red leather-bound tome, which should be stored on the uppermost floor of the Observatorium.</target>
