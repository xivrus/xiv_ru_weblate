You wonder why he continued taking orders from customers in that case, but that is not your bailiwick. Go to Camp Bluefog and talk to the Concern's company man, Papawazu.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB810_00919_SYNTGOHT_000_001&lt;tab&gt;The fact is, it's been a mighty struggle for many moons to procure processed ceruleum from Amajina &amp; Sons, and now they've entirely ceased doing business with most vendors.</target>

We pay for the sins of producers like Amajina and what do we get from them in turn? Not so much as a how-do-you-do. Edwyn's quarrel is with them, not me.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSB810_00919_SYNTGOHT_000_004&lt;tab&gt;Tsk, do you not know? The Concern has the exclusive right to mine ceruleum in northern Thanalan. They can do whatever they want. You can always try them directly. Go talk to Papawazu at Camp Bluefog─though I warn you, he's a smug little toad!</target>
