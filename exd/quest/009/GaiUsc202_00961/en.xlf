She asks that you speak with Skyfryn in an effort to learn how he obtained permission to travel to the isles.</target>

In a rare moment of lucidity, he gives you a golden feather and bids you give it to a man named Mimidoa, along with his apologies. Return to Ceana and see what she makes of Skyfryn's words.</target>

However, the craftsmen have all abandoned their work or simply vanished, presumably due to the rumors of an undead infestation. Upon learning that you wish to visit the Isles of Umbra for your own purposes, Mimidoa offers you a writ of passage, on the condition that you look into the rumors on his behalf.

I've given your findings some thought, and I've concluded that this talk of spirits is naught more than local folklore. As for why all travel to the Isles of Umbra is restricted, well...mayhap it's considered too dangerous, owing to the abandonment of Pharos Sirius?</target>
