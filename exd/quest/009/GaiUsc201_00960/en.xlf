However, she has yet to test this hypothesis, as all access to the isles is prohibited at present. As she lacks your charming wit and way with words, she bids you question the Yellowjackets of Aleport in her stead, and attempt to discover the reason behind the travel restrictions.</target>

It's rather puzzling, since I always take the time to explain my motivations in great detail to the subjects of my questioning.</target>
