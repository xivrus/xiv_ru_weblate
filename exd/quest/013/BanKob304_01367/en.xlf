				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANKOB304_01367_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Bo Bu, proving to be among the more spirited kobolds at the dig, dismisses the vaunted abilities of Zo Ga and his followers, asserting that their strength is merely the product of superior resources paid for with ill-gotten wealth. To test his theory, he would “borrow” some crystalline saltpeter from the 13th Order's stores in U'Ghamaro, and deliver it to the 789th's own Ba Go, to see what destructive wonders the acolyte might fashion from such prime material. Or rather, he would have &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; do this─there is a limit to the dustman's courage, after all.</target>

Break the news to Bo Bu, and try to be gentle about it.</target>
