To wit: you will bring ore to Camp Overlook under the pretense that you confiscated it from the kobolds' stock, requesting spare rations as reward for your efforts. As the dustman himself has no intention of parting with his own meager mining haul, travel to Iron Lake and acquire the necessary ore in his stead.</target>
