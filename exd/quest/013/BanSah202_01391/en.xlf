Instinct being what it is, anyone slaying a couple of young Sapsa elbst should find &lt;var 08 E905 ((herself)) ((himself)) /var&gt; in the company of the irate sire. With this knowledge in the back of your mind, proceed into Trident territory and start dispatching elbst. When the sire arrives, use the milky vitriol given to you against the steely skinned creature and lay it low.</target>

Things are definitely not better under this sea, and there may be calls on your service again.</target>
