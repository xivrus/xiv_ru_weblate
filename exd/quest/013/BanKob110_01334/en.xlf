None the wiser, the 411th Order plans to smelt the 789th's yield in their furnace, and Bo Zu fears that his ingenuity will not be well received. At Bo Zu's request, consult with the acolyte Ba Go, that you might lay waste to the furnace before the dustman's duplicity comes to light.</target>

※Fail to complete your objective in the allotted span of time, and the limpet bomb will detonate, causing damage to you in the process.</target>
