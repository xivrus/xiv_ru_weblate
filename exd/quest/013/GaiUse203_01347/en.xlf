Believing that they may have valuable information on the current state of affairs within the Empire, he is resolved to seek them out, and wants you on hand to ensure that all proceeds smoothly. Knowing how unaccommodating the Sultansworn can be, he suggests beginning the search on the Royal Promenade in Ul'dah.</target>
