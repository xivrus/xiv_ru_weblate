The need for action is plain, but it soon becomes clear that neither the Admiral nor your fellow Scions know of any means to vie with the Lord of the Whorl upon the open sea. It is then that Storm Marshal Eynzahr steps forward with a most unorthodox proposal: to use the power of corrupted crystals, borne upon an improvised twin vessel, to rob Leviathan of his command over the element of water. Being the best─and only─plan available, all involved swiftly agree to support the endeavor, yet you cannot help but wonder at its ambition.
