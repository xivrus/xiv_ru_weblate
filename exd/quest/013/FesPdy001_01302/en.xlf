        <target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY001_01302_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;As might be expected given the season, the Goldsmiths' Guild already struggles to meet a deluge of doll orders, and cannot accept any further commissions. All hope is not lost, however, as Serendipity appears to have one last trick up her sleeve. Should your heart be set on proving yourself the daintiest doll-dresser in the land, speak with her once more.</target>
