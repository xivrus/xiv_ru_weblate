        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSD301_01313_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;After sharing their findings with the Sons of Saint Coinach, Urianger and Alisaie have come to a conclusion: that the elder primal Bahamut can be banished into the aether if the colossal devices which hold him captive are deactivated. According to their information, the path to the second mechanism can be found in the North Shroud, where a gigantic fragment of Dalamud impales the ground. Make your way to Fallgourd Float and speak with Alisaie's assistant, Lieutenant Anaelle, to learn what dangers lie ahead.</target>
