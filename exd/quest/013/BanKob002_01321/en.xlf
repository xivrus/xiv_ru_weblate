				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANKOB002_01321_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Gi Gu shares with you the sad tale of the 789th Order─unable to meet the demanding quotas imposed upon them by their betters, they have been exiled from the tunnels and forced to eke out a meager existence on the fringes of kobold society. While the only route to redemption is to improve their mining output, this is easier said than done, for the ore veins in their new home are as good as barren. Answer Gi Gu's sad plea by traveling to the Kobold Dig and retrieving the dregs cast aside by his more accomplished peers, that the 789th might salvage even a scrap of dignity.</target>
