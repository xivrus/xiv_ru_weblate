        <target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB202_01316_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;According to Inspector Hildibrand, the vase could be reconstructed with the aid of a certain master goldsmith─a man as fearsome as he is skilled, capable of wielding his hammer as both a tool of creation and destruction. The goldsmith is like to be found in Bluefog, where he often goes to gather his materials. With the aid of your comrades─including the newly recruited Gilgamesh and his loyal companion, Enkidu─begin your search there.</target>

Though it pains him greatly, the inspector proclaims that he must perform the dance of House Manderville in order to declare your peaceful intent, and begins to do so at once. Alas, a sudden injury renders him unable to continue, and, left with no other option, he bequeaths knowledge of the dance to you.</target>
