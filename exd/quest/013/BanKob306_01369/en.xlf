Bo Bu has no intention of betraying his friends at the dig, but he would slake his curiosity regarding the delicacies in which his more accomplished peers delight. Pay a visit to the most approachable member of Zo Ga's order─the alchemist Ga Zi─to see what might be done.</target>

As a growing young kobold's stomach hangs in the balance, delve into U'Ghamaro and locate one of the keyholder pots, slaying any patrolman fool enough to interfere.</target>
