The Lalafellin lieutenant is visibly taken aback at the answer. Ururu goes on to explain that the Scarlet Sea Devil was a particularly savage Sahagin pirate that terrorized the seas of western La Noscea more than fifteen years ago. At the culmination of his chilling tale, the lieutenant departs to report the disturbing revelation to his superior.

Lamenting the loss of his vessel and livelihood, but thankful for his life, the captain of the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Swallow&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; gifts you with a sack of oranges he managed to salvage from the hold.
