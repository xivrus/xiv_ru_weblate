        <target state="final">TEXT_BANSAH105_01383_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;According to one of Fyuu's skulking spawnbrothers, the Coral Tridents have captured a number of Maelstrom soldiers. With naught but death or “drowning” awaiting such prisoners, the young Sahagin expects the soldiers' comrades to mount a retaliatory expedition. In order to prevent a violent disruption to the spawning grounds, Fyuu asks that you free the captured troops yourself. Approach the Sahagin sentries guarding the area, and obtain their keys─by peaceful means if possible, forceful means if necessary.</target>

The young Sahagin, echoing the teachings of his clutchfather, appears determined to end the pointless cycle where vengeance begets only further vengeance.</target>
