        <target state="final">TEXT_BANSAH210_01399_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Coral Tridents have seized a merchant vessel, bent on mastering the dubious art of sending shorewalker ships to their watery doom. Your task is to board the merchantman and dispatch four surfspine Sahagin. The open water being a cruel mistress to tender-skinned shorewalkers such as yourself, ask Pahh the seabeast tamer to provide you with an elbst for the journey. </target>

Listening to Houu, you are uneasily reminded that the first casualties of any revolution are the mild of heart.</target>
