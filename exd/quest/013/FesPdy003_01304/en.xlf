He urges you to participate, suggesting that you speak with Serendipity, mistress of the Goldsmiths' Guild in Ul'dah, about acquiring a doll for the contest.

All hope is not lost, however, as Serendipity appears to have one last trick up her sleeve. Should your heart be set on proving yourself the daintiest doll-dresser in the land, speak with her once more.</target>
