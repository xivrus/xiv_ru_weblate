In the discussion which follows, the Archon focuses his attention on the unexpected presence of Nael van Darnus, the defeated imperial legatus who once sought to bring the red moon Dalamud crashing down upon Eorzea. Urianger surmises that van Darnus's early efforts to establish control of the Allagan satellite inadvertently awoke the sleeping Bahamut, exposing the White Raven to the elder primal's irresistible will. Given the role played by such thralls in perpetuating Bahamut's existence, Alisaie declares that all must be found and eliminated─Louisoix's aetherial shade included. With that, she thanks you and departs, leaving Urianger to muse upon the value of uncovering a truth that promises so much anguish and sorrow...</target>
