Inspector Briardien immediately deduces that the first Lady Durilda was in fact the thief who sent the challenge in disguise, and that Gilgamesh was a different thief who had no interest in the Treaty-Blade. The flying card which then embeds itself in the inspector's forehead appears to substantiate this theory, as the words writ upon it match the style of the previous challenge. “I shall come to claim the lapis maiden's virtue,” it reads, a bold challenge Inspector Briardien is glad to accept─until Inspector Hildibrand preempts his declaration, driving his rival into a frenzy. As the two men circle Lord Lolorito's statue in the square, Maria bursts into laughter, and her normally stern mother soon does the same.
