In order to ensure victory, she suggests you put on a show in Ul'dah. With the princess doll in tow, set out to the streets and perform a /dance for crowds of potential voters.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.

※The Princess Edvya doll minion will be lost upon dismissing it or logging out of the game. The doll can be retrieved by speaking with Serendipity.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Your sure-footed display of festival spirit has Ul'dah's most influential aesthetes abuzz with talk of your princess doll.

Upon closer examination, Serendipity discovers that its core has burned out, and suspects that the princess doll had grown quite fond of you─so much so, that the thought of being sold at auction overwhelmed its systems. The doll may yet be saved, but due to its unique architecture, Serendipity requires peach tree oil before any repairs can be attempted. Gather petals from the peach trees in Ul'dah, that Serendipity may extract the oil needed to save the doll.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;You have scoured the flora of Ul'dah for the freshest, most fragrant peach blossoms to be had, and gathered three sackfuls for Serendipity.

It would seem the doll feigned a malfunction in order to realize its one true desire: to remain in the company of the adventurer of whom it had grown so fond. The guildmaster then muses that this behavior is not unlike Princess Edvya's own ruse so many years ago. Though the contest has long since been lost, Serendipity is comforted by the knowledge that you, she, and the doll have celebrated the true spirit of Little Ladies' Day in a way that few do these days. She implores you to take the doll as your own, and grant its holiday wish.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;With the Edvya doll minion summoned, /dance for the festival gathering at the Gold Court.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;With the Edvya doll minion summoned, /dance for the festival gathering near Sunsilk Tapestries.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;With the Edvya doll minion summoned, /dance for the festival gathering outside Arrzaneth Ossuary.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="27" approved="yes"><source>27</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_TODO_03&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Serendipity at the Goldsmiths' Guild.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="28" approved="yes"><source>28</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_TODO_04&lt;tab&gt;Gather petals from the tree at the Gold Court.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="29" approved="yes"><source>29</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_TODO_05&lt;tab&gt;Gather petals from the tree near Sunsilk Tapestries.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="30" approved="yes"><source>30</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_TODO_06&lt;tab&gt;Gather petals from the tree outside Arrzaneth Ossuary.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="31" approved="yes"><source>31</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_TODO_07&lt;tab&gt;Deliver the peach blossom petals to Serendipity.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY006_01307_SERENDIPITY_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Oh, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;.
