Worried that their prideful boasting will encourage others to attempt to emulate their victory, the young Sahagin asks that you slip aboard the merchantman and take the wind out of their sails. Ride an elbst to the trading vessel, and defeat the enemies on deck until the leader is provoked into engaging you himself.</target>
