While he has faith that Seww, Houu, and Fyuu can shoulder the duties of feeding and disciplining their clutchmates, the clutchfather is concerned that the Coral Tridents may attempt some manner of retaliation in his absence. Seww, however, seems distressed at Novv's departure. Speak with the young Sahagin, and learn what troubles him.</target>

He asks that you track down the elder Sahagin who once fought with Novv, and learn what secrets they might unwittingly reveal. Take the clutchmark given to you by Seww, and visit the veteran beastmen found near the Reef of Sending, in Reaver Hide, and on Moonshade Isle.</target>

His intimidating aura undiminished, Novv breaks the spirit of his would-be attackers without a single word and dismisses Zugg with barely concealed contempt.
