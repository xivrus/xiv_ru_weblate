Alas, there is one small complication: the presence of an arcane ward preventing access to the inner chambers that is passable only by servants of Ox'Dalan, protector of the underworld. As all present ponder a suitable course of action, the Great Serpent of Ronka lets forth a great scree, no doubt seeking to impart wisdom to your band. Sadly, no one present is able to comprehend the meaning of the divine protector's words, leaving you no choice but to accompany Chaqurl Qhotl to Slitherbough to seek the aid of the one man who can.
