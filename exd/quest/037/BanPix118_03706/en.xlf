Because water is so precious there, they can barely have enough for a bath, let alone play games like “Dunk the Witch” or “Bismarck's Bluff”!</target>

Once I've worked my magic on it, we'll have rivers and waterfalls galore! Naturally, you'll be the one collecting the heart, though I doubt its owner will be too happy to part with it. Don't worry, you &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;probably&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; won't be horribly killed!</target>

It's only a dream, so it's all perfectly safe, unless the rumor about “if you die in your dreams, you die in real life” is true...
I might have to check that at some point, actually.</target>
