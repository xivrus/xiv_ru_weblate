        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX118_03706_UINNEE_000_003&lt;tab&gt;All we need is an icewater undine heart. Once I've worked my magic on it, we'll have rivers and waterfalls galore! Naturally, you'll be the one collecting the heart, though I doubt its owner will be too happy to part with it. Don't worry, you &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;probably&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; won't be horribly killed!</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX118_03706_UINNEE_000_012&lt;tab&gt;Soon, Lyhe Mheg will be filled with the sounds of children's laughter as they splash and swim and drag each other into the depths, just like the Fuath! It's only a dream, so it's all perfectly safe, unless the rumor about “if you die in your dreams, you die in real life” is true...
I might have to check that at some point, actually.</target>
