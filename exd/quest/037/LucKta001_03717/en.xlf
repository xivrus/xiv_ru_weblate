The culprit has yet to be identified, and there are fears that the lingering enmity between the dwarven communities could lead the residents of Komra to hold Tomra's people responsible, so &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;someone&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; must solve the mystery before tensions rise. Why this someone should be you is unclear, but is that not always the way of it?</target>

Alas, he is at a loss for leads, so he suggests that you continue the investigation in his stead. Perhaps there will be some manner of clue that can only be spotted through eyes honed by many years of seeking out random objects at the behest of everyone and their mothers.</target>

Its make and general state of cleanliness suggest that it was not so recently recovered from ruins as its location might lead one to think, but the dig site chief ought to be able to tell you for certain.</target>

Unfortunately, she does not know whence the site watch himself purchased the item, or indeed how he managed to afford it to begin with.</target>
