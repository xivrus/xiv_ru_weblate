All for the chance to go higher, and higher, and feel like you're about to take flight. But you won't! It's depressing, is what it is.</target>

In any case, I have a tree and this piece of wood I picked up off of the ground, so I've practically built the entire thing already!</target>

Falling to your death is no fun at all, even if it &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;is&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; a dream. Maybe you could get me some of that sturdy psammead silk everyone raves about? Pretty please?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX127_03715_UINNEE_000_004&lt;tab&gt;It's the big, nasty mother psammeads that have the strongest silk. They're always a bit reluctant to come out of hiding, but fortunately, they'll come scuttling if you attack the smaller ones!</target>

Wouldn't want to risk the children! Once it's properly spun into the dream, maybe I'll even give it a try myself!</target>
