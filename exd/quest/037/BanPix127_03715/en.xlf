All for the chance to go higher, and higher, and feel like you're about to take flight. But you won't! It's depressing, is what it is.</target>

And if they want a sad simulacrum of flight, who am I to refuse? In any case, I have a tree and this piece of wood I picked up off of the ground, so I've practically built the entire thing already!</target>

Falling to your death is no fun at all, even if it &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;is&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; a dream. Maybe you could get me some of that sturdy psammead silk everyone raves about? Pretty please?</target>

I'll have to trick some mature mortals into testing it first, of course. Wouldn't want to risk the children! Once it's properly spun into the dream, maybe I'll even give it a try myself!</target>
