Seeing this as merely the natural progression of events, he casually walks off to report to Lisette while barely acknowledging your presence. While there is no end of places you would rather be, you resolve to follow him and honor your promise to Lisette.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
