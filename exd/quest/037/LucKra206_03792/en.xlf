The sprouting of lush plant life around the camp fills each member of the group with hope for the future, although it may be some time before this remarkable change becomes widespread. Ryne proposes that everyone take a well-earned rest before considering the next move, displaying patience in place of her usual hastiness. She also demonstrates a surprising degree of maturity when she admits to not being able to solve every problem by herself, and expresses her wish that she and Gaia should support one another in the coming days. After a somewhat reticent Gaia gives her agreement, Urianger directs the group back to Amh Araeng.</target>
