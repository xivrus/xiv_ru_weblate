Gazing upon Elidibus with a mixture of pity and scorn, she proceeds to expose him for what he truly is: a primal, granted strength by the desire for salvation. Thus has he sought to inspire the masses to rise up as Warriors of Light. Unmoved, the Ascian coolly confirms Y'shtola's theories, but when she subsequently questions whether the many voices that sustain him have irrevocably changed his own, his expression hardens. No matter how much he should forget, he declares, he will always remember his duty. With that, he vanishes, but not before serving notice of his intent to gain the power to defeat you.</target>
