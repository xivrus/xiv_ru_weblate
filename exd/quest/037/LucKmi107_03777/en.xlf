Even as you ponder what your foe may do next, another starshower appears in the skies over Eulmore, this time accompanied by an illusion of Amaurot... Yet it does not end there, for you are promptly set upon by spectral warriors who emerge from arcane rings resembling those conjured in the Exarch's summoning rituals. Whatever the reason for this uncanny similarity, all agree that you must take the battle elsewhere lest innocents fall into harm's way. To that end, you resolve to board a waiting airship and fly for the Crystarium.

Wings thus clipped, you have no choice but to make your way back to the Crystarium on foot, with spectral foes dogging your every step. Though your route proves to be unexpectedly circuitous, aided by many a friend made during your time in Norvrandt, you finally emerge in the familiar environs of Lakeland.</target>

But a short distance from the Crystarium, you are surrounded by an army of spectral warriors, halting your party's breathless advance. In an oft-repeated scene, your comrades duly volunteer to hold the enemy at bay while you alone press on to your destination, and so you leave them. As you plunge through the forest, you stumble upon the prostrate forms of the Exarch and Beq Lugg, who have apparently escaped a close encounter with Elidibus. In rueful tones, they inform you that the Ascian has stolen the Exarch's spirit vessel─and has thus acquired the means to control the Crystal Tower. Despite his fast-advancing crystallization, the Exarch expresses his determination to help you to put a stop to Elidibus's plot, and fixes his gaze upon the tower.</target>
