Even as you ponder what your foe may do next, another starshower appears in the skies over Eulmore, this time accompanied by an illusion of Amaurot... Yet it does not end there, for you are promptly set upon by spectral warriors who emerge from arcane rings resembling those conjured in the Exarch's summoning rituals. Whatever the reason for this uncanny similarity, all agree that you must take the battle elsewhere lest innocents fall into harm's way. To that end, you resolve to board a waiting airship and fly for the Crystarium.
