That's it! I'm thinking about this too much. I need something unexpected, something spontaneous. After all, dreams are by their very nature unpredictable!

Not quite as unusual as I was hoping for, I must say. Bits of wood like this are rather commonplace in Il Mheg, you know. Still, it's about the right size for a magic wand.

It's strange to think something so mundane could lead to such a fantastic idea! Of course, we have my imagination to thank for that.
