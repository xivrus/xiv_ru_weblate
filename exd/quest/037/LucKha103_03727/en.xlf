It is revealed that the dragon is none other than Audaine's husband, Marcelloix, whom the inquisitor is determined to punish as a heretic. However, Francel reminds him that, under new laws, those accused of heresy are to be accorded fair hearing, and volunteers to take Marcelloix and the dragonet, Ehll Tou, into his care. The tense confrontation thus ended, you all make your way to the Firmament to further discuss the situation.</target>

Having had a gutful of men's troubles, the dragonet, Ehll Tou, flies off on her own to see the district, and Francel bids you go after her lest she cause alarm among the residents.</target>
