After you are joined by Ryne and Urianger, Yalfort informs you that the girl who has been unconscious since leading the attack on Eden has awoken and is being escorted by Thancred to this very location. You learn that her name is Gaia and that she was originally a resident of Eulmore, although she has no memory of recent events. A short while later, she arrives with her newfound footman close behind, and it seems Thancred has been given the unenviable task of carrying her luggage. It soon becomes abundantly clear that she is incredibly impatient, and she demands that if the group insists on speaking at length, they should at least find somewhere to sit down first.</target>

She attributes these powers to a voice inside her head that she refers to as “the faerie,” which bears an uncanny similarity to Ryne's relationship to Minfilia. Gaia comes to the conclusion that if it was the faerie's intention for her to make contact with Eden, that is where she must go, and in so doing find the answers to the questions surrounding her past. In spite of Ryne's and Urianger's warnings, Gaia rushes off into the desert, displaying a surprising turn of speed, prompting Thancred to lead the rest of the group in chasing after her.</target>

As it lunges to strike, it is suddenly enveloped in swirling magicks that leave nary a trace of the chitin-plated beast behind, while Gaia herself is thankfully unharmed.</target>

Thancred and Urianger's attempts to talk her out of it are vehemently rebuffed, though her two mentors soon admit that it was merely a ploy to test her resolve. Once again, Gaia cuts the conversation short and leads the way to the Derrick, where your transportation to the Empty awaits.</target>
