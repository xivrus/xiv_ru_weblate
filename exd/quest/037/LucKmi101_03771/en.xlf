While on the subject, you take the opportunity to ask him what he knows of Warriors of Light, and he seems all too eager to enlighten you─when suitably prepared. The librarian duly heads back to the Cabinet of Curiosity to gather up materials, and bids you join him there at your earliest convenience.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKMI101_03771_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Reporting for your lesson at the Cabinet, you are soon joined by Alphinaud, Alisaie, and Ryne, who chanced to be there on separate errands. His class duly assembled, Moren proceeds to explain that, despite sharing no apparent connection, many individuals have been hailed as Warriors of Light throughout Vrandtic history, and that in time the title came to be a synonym for hero. Intrigued, Alphinaud observes that the epithet is similarly used in the Source, and posits that Hydaelyn is likely the common thread. As you ponder what this might imply, you are interrupted by a little girl's excited voice followed by the rumble of tumbling tomes. You turn towards the commotion to find three Crystarium younglings, a shame-faced Riqi-Tio and her friends Arkil and Eirwel, whom Moren wastes no time chastising for their lack of care. Upon realizing she is in the presence of the great Warrior of Darkness, however, Riqi-Tio's chagrin reverts to excitement, and she can barely contain herself as she asks you what she must do to become a hero─or “Warrior of Light.”</target>

She wishes to become a specific kind of Warrior of Light─one who uses potions to fight─and has come to the Cabinet to study. Rather than through tomes, however, Alphinaud believes she stands to learn best by observing the chirurgeons at work, and to that end he bids you accompany the Mystel child to Spagyrics.</target>

Instead, he concludes, the desire to help their fellow man was present from the beginning.
