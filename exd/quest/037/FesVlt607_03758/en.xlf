Rodrigault then instructs you to wait just beyond his arranged meeting spot with your masked client.

With some skepticism, Ywain agrees to take part in a meditation exercise at Rodrigault's suggestion, and the two of them make their way to Stillglade Fane where they are greeted by Brother E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Sumi&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Yan. Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by Sylphie, however, who astutely ascertains precisely what sort of love the guildmaster &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;truly&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; seeks, and begins to lecture him on matters including personal hygiene, whisking him off to the Twelve know where that she might transform him into a less offensively odored individual.</target>
