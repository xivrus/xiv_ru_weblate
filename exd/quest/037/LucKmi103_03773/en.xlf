He reveals that he has not been in the best of health since plucking Urianger from a watery grave, suffering regular bouts of dizziness prior to his recent mishap. In the absence of any obvious physical cause, it seems certain that the link between his body and soul has weakened further. With time growing short, the Exarch bids you make a trip to the Source to consult Krile regarding the plan to return everyone home. Thus do you set out for the Rising Stones, where your friends' unmoving bodies still lie.</target>
