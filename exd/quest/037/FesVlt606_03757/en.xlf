        <target state="final">TEXT_FESVLT606_03757_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You accompany Bert─newly minted as this year's emissary of love─to visit your heretofore masked client, who reveals himself to be none other than Guildmaster Ywain of Lancers' Guild fame. Though somewhat skeptical, Ywain humors Bert's suggestion to take up woodworking, and the two of them make their way to the Carpenters' Guild where they are greeted by a skeptical Guildmaster Beatin. The ever-serious soldier stutters that he has come seeking a better understanding of love─a confession which Beatin, as is his wont, egregiously mishears and misinterprets as a desire to deeply understand &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;lumber&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. Convinced that he has found a kindred spirit in his fellow guildmaster, Beatin whisks Ywain off to the depths of the Twelveswood, that they might bond over their newfound shared passion for the wonderful world of wood.</target>
