Should you be inclined to heed his call, seek out Chaqurl Qhotl and see how you might best proceed.

Seeking passage further down in the depths beneath Hopl's Stopple, the Qitari excavation team's path was blocked by a massive water vein. Suffering severe chills in attempting to navigate the icy flow, Towarl Manol has taken ill and lies incapacitated in bed. Hoping to aid their friend, the Qitari father and son once again summon Valan and Quinfort from Slitherbough. The two suggest fashioning a traditional remedy and something to keep the bedridden Qitari warm, and entrust you with the task of finding a vital material for the latter. You resolve to go forth and do your part to keep your Qitari friends in comfort.</target>

Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, it appears to be as weathered and worn as the others. Nevertheless, the Qitari father and son have each come to their own theories regarding the meaning of the markings, which depict what appears to be a curious race of fishmen.
