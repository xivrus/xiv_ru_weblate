They lament that the door remains locked, but fortunately, you have a remedy for their woes: the key dropped by the disgraced watchman. Once you have handed it over to Anogg, there is little question as to whether or not the three of you will be heading inside to explore.</target>

Anogg and Konogg make short work of them with their bombs, and rush to the side of a strangely garbed woman lying prone─completely ignoring the indignant site chief, presumably drawn by the thunderous report of multiple unauthorized explosions, in so doing. The mysterious woman in white identifies herself as “2P,” but gives no further details, instead insisting that you delve deeper into the ruins to stop the “machine lifeforms”─which you gather must be the machina from earlier─without further ado. </target>

The way thus cleared, you are free at last to seek the truth of the machine graveyard─with Anogg and Konogg at your side whether you like it or not.

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKTA002_03718_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Through the metal doors, you find not broken remains scattered across the floor of a darkened cave, but rather rusted metal structures growing out of a verdant valley, reaching skyward and stretching into the distance as far as the eye can see. 2P tells you that this place was used in the manufacture of the so-called machine lifeforms, and indeed, no small number of them remain within. You fight your way past mechanical monsters great and greater until at last you come upon an adversary of an altogether different nature. Though you sense that this 9S and 2P have a complex relationship, you have no opportunity to press for details, as a heated battle ensues almost immediately. Though you are ultimately victorious, there is no telling what might emerge next, and 2P suggests that you withdraw for a time. Reading the exhaustion writ on her face, you agree.</target>

Just then, 2P reawakens. She remains conscious long enough to tell you that both she and 9S are mechanical constructs made to resemble men, that more such “androids” may be on their way to attack Komra as you speak, and that a “key” to understanding─and perhaps defeating─them lies somewhere within the factory. She then ceases to function entirely, coming to a stop all of a sudden like a wind-up automaton.</target>

She also provides you with a new tool of her own design─the portable archive─which you may use to record interesting observations in the course of your investigation. With so much of the unfamiliar landscape that has been so well hidden within Kholusia as yet unexplored, it will doubtless see plenty of use.
