Anogg and Konogg make short work of them with their bombs, and rush to the side of a strangely garbed woman lying prone─completely ignoring the indignant site chief, presumably drawn by the thunderous report of multiple unauthorized explosions, in so doing. The mysterious woman in white identifies herself as “2P,” but gives no further details, instead insisting that you delve deeper into the ruins to stop the “machine lifeforms”─which you gather must be the machina from earlier─without further ado. </target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKTA002_03718_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Though 2P finds her ingress further into the ruins stymied by a technologically secured door, Anogg and Konogg are not above using the same trick thrice, and blow the entire locking mechanism to smithereens before anyone can so much as make an alternative proposal. The way thus cleared, you are free at last to seek the truth of the machine graveyard─with Anogg and Konogg at your side whether you like it or not.

You fight your way past mechanical monsters great and greater until at last you come upon an adversary of an altogether different nature. Though you sense that this 9S and 2P have a complex relationship, you have no opportunity to press for details, as a heated battle ensues almost immediately. Though you are ultimately victorious, there is no telling what might emerge next, and 2P suggests that you withdraw for a time.

Just then, 2P reawakens. She remains conscious long enough to tell you that both she and 9S are mechanical constructs made to resemble men, that more such “androids” may be on their way to attack Komra as you speak, and that a “key” to understanding─and perhaps defeating─them lies somewhere within the factory.
