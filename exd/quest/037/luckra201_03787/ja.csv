"","TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_SEQ_01<tab>In the marketplace of Mord Souq, you are greeted by Yalfort, a member of the select few privy to the details surrounding the investigation being carried out in the Empty. After you are joined by Ryne and Urianger, Yalfort informs you that the girl who has been unconscious since leading the attack on Eden has awoken and is being escorted by Thancred to this very location. You learn that her name is Gaia and that she was originally a resident of Eulmore, although she has no memory of recent events. A short while later, she arrives with her newfound footman close behind, and it seems Thancred has been given the unenviable task of carrying her luggage. It soon becomes abundantly clear that she is incredibly impatient, and she demands that if the group insists on speaking at length, they should at least find somewhere to sit down first.","TEXT_LUCKRA201_03787_SEQ_01<tab>前回までの冒険録：<br>冒険者たちとともに無の大地の調査に乗り出したリーンは、そこに眠っていた最初の罪喰い「エデン」を発見する。守護者を倒し、エデンの制御権を握った冒険者たちだったが、その直後、異質な魔物を使役する謎の少女の襲撃を受ける。撃退に成功するも、その素性や目的など一切が不明のまま、少女は意識を喪失、一行は彼女の身柄を確保するのだった。やがてリーンたちは、疑似神降ろしを通じて、無の大地を復活させる方法を見出す。水属性、土属性の励起に成功すると、無の大地に変化が生じる。残る属性を象徴する疑似蛮神、そして謎の少女の目的……。さらなる激闘の予感を胸に秘めたまま、一行はモルド・スークへと帰還する。<br>　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*<br>謎の少女が目を醒ました。彼女の名はガイア。彼女から詳しい話を聞くため、モルド・スークにいる「ガイア」と話そう。","","False","0x00000001","",""

She attributes these powers to a voice inside her head that she refers to as “the faerie,” which bears an uncanny similarity to Ryne's relationship to Minfilia. Gaia comes to the conclusion that if it was the faerie's intention for her to make contact with Eden, that is where she must go, and in so doing find the answers to the questions surrounding her past.
