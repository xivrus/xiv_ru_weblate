At that moment, countless flying sin eaters appear from nowhere and begin circling above Eden, with the glyph at their center, though rather than attacking this dark entity, they seem to be in its thrall. With Gaia now rendered immobile and entirely defenseless, you have no choice but to take her to Eden's core and decide how best to approach this unforeseen threat.","TEXT_LUCKRA204_03790_SEQ_02<tab>Urianger expliquait à Gaïa que le renouveau du Grand Vide pourrait prendre des années voire des décennies, quand soudain la voix intérieure de l'adolescente s'est de nouveau mise à la tourmenter, la poussant à aller se rafraîchir sur le pont supérieur d'Éden.
