Should you be inclined to heed its call, seek out Chaqurl Qhotl and see how you might best proceed.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANQIQ003_03796_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You seek out and speak with Chaqurl Qhotl. It appears that further progress through the tunnels of Hopl's Stopple will require you to perform a ceremony in obeisance to Ox'Dalan, god of death and protector of the underworld. Qitarl Natl suggests that perhaps the Viis, as a fellow ancient race with ties to Ronka, might be able to offer apt advice in the matter. Finding his reasoning sound, you agree to accompany Chaqurl Qhotl to Fanow in search of wisdom.</target>

After reminiscing about her friendship with one of Chaqurl's ancestors, Master Lanille enlightens you with the knowledge that a traditional Viis ritual may serve to appease Ox'Dalan and offer the Qitari excavation team passage to the tunnels below. At the Viis' request, you set out to procure an item suitable for use as an offering to the gods of old.</target>
