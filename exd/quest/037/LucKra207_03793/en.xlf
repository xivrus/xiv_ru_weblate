        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA207_03793_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;As instructed, you meet Urianger at the Wandering Stairs, and are joined by Thancred, Ryne, and Gaia. Urianger reveals that the time has come for him and Thancred to return to the Source or else risk losing their physical forms permanently. While this does not come entirely as a surprise, Ryne is clearly upset by the thought of being separated, perhaps indefinitely, from the two men she considers her mentors. Thancred in particular has been a father figure to her ever since he freed her from Eulmore, and his absence will be sorely felt. Though as he reminds her, she is not alone, as you and Gaia will continue to offer her your support. Urianger offers Gaia some parting words, warning her not to surrender control to the voice inside her head. Thancred and Urianger then leave to make preparations for the journey back to the Source, leaving the rest of you to contemplate on what the future might hold for the Empty.</target>
