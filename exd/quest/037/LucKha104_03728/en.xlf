        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKHA104_03728_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;At Francel's urging, Marcelloix tells you his tale. He used to support his family as a craftsman, he explains, but disillusioned with the commonfolk's lot, he made the decision to leave Ishgard and follow Lady Iceheart. By the time he had completed his transformation into a dragon, however, the war had ended. And to make matters worse, he found that he was unable to revert to his original form. Deeply remorseful, Marcelloix wishes to make amends to his wife and child, and at Francel's suggestion, he decides to express himself through action, using his skills to make gifts for them and other residents. To begin with, Francel offers to find a suitable venue for Marcelloix to do his work, and together you make your way into the New Nest.</target>
