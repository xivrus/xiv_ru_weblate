        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA203_03789_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Following a brief bout of contemplation and postulation, Urianger arrives at the conclusion that in order to complete the cycle of rainfall and evaporation in the Empty, the elements of wind and fire must be restored simultaneously. Naturally, this means that the burden on Ryne and yourself will in effect be doubled, as you attempt to draw forth and meld the two contrasting types of aether. Not to be deterred, you both accept the challenge, though as Thancred points out, the increased strain will require you to be well rested before embarking on your next voyage. Gaia, impatient as always, storms off, while Ryne ponders over what might be troubling her.</target>

Having been raised in isolation, Ryne has precious little experience in speaking with people of a similar age, and she is unsure as to how to approach Gaia. Given what the pair have in common, it seems reasonable to expect that they would be well matched as friends, although Gaia's sullen demeanor makes even approaching her somewhat daunting. Thancred encourages Ryne to take the first step and initiate conversation, while the rest of you silently observe the exchange from just within earshot.</target>

Unfortunately, this is met with a less-than-favorable response, with Gaia expressing her distaste for Ryne's positive outlook before turning on her heels and making her way to Eden's core. Taking this as a cue, Urianger suggests that now would be the opportune moment to commence the next phase of the plan.</target>

You conjure the images of Ifrit and Garuda while Ryne calls forth the necessary aether to give form to your memories, although some doubt lingers over Ryne's ability to focus on the task at hand. Putting such fears to one side, all that remains is for you to vanquish two raging primals at the same time. What could be simpler?
