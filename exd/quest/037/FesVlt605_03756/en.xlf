Astrid then instructs you to wait just beyond her arranged meeting spot with your masked client.

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESVLT605_03756_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You accompany Astrid─newly minted as this year's emissary of love─to visit your heretofore masked client, who reveals himself to be none other than Guildmaster Ywain of Lancers' Guild fame. Though somewhat skeptical, he takes her suggestion to expand his horizons to heart, and the two of them make their way to the Leatherworkers' Guild where Ywain is scheduled to deliver a shipment of animal hides. Upon their arrival the all-too-serious soldier promptly manages to make a fool of himself by confessing his search for love to Guildmaster Geva. As she eyes Ywain in a manner that suggests she wants to turn &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;his&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; hide into a sack, the three of you are joined by none other than the notorious naturalist Marcette. Spying the collection of rare animal skins in Ywain's possession, she swiftly volunteers him to be her newest research assistant, whisking him off to parts unknown without so much as a second thought.</target>
