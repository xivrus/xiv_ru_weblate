The two apprentices eagerly await your arrival in Hammerlea, where the lesson is to be held, though exactly what skills you are expected to impart has yet to be explained.</target>

Your self-proclaimed mentor gives you a moment to collect your thoughts before he activates the adorable-yet-deadly axe-wielding automaton.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;At the Blue Mages' Guild, you learn that not only is Martyn charging his apprentices for his tuition, but that the demonstration that you provided actually set them back more than the usual amount. He claims that this is a means to an end, as their contributions are required for the day-to-day running of the guild. Perhaps in a somewhat hurried attempt to change the subject, he approaches the topic of the various roles that adventurers fulfill when forming groups to go exploring. Normally, the members divide their duties between offense, defense, and healing, whereas in the blue mage's case, it is possible for them to perform all of these duties simultaneously. In fact, there have been several reports of parties comprised entirely of blue mages meeting with considerable success on such quests. Martyn is keen to investigate this further, in the hopes he will be able to prove the effectiveness of his guild's members in real combat situations. In the meantime, he requests that you prepare for the next lesson with Nutiba Buntiba and P'yandih by mastering Whistle, a spell which he presumably already possesses himself.

※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn upon reaching level 55 and learning Whistle.</target>
