He claims that this is a means to an end, as their contributions are required for the day-to-day running of the guild. Perhaps in a somewhat hurried attempt to change the subject, he approaches the topic of the various roles that adventurers fulfill when forming groups to go exploring. Normally, the members divide their duties between offense, defense, and healing, whereas in the blue mage's case, it is possible for them to perform all of these duties simultaneously. In fact, there have been several reports of parties comprised entirely of blue mages meeting with considerable success on such quests. Martyn is keen to investigate this further, in the hopes he will be able to prove the effectiveness of his guild's members in real combat situations. In the meantime, he requests that you prepare for the next lesson with Nutiba Buntiba and P'yandih by mastering Whistle, a spell which he presumably already possesses himself.

※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn upon reaching level 55 and learning Whistle.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Martyn in Hammerlea.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Martyn again and defeat the arena viking.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Martyn.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="27" approved="yes"><source>27</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_TODO_03&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Martyn in Ul'dah.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBAOZ530_03733_MARTYN_100_000&lt;tab&gt;Come on, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;.
