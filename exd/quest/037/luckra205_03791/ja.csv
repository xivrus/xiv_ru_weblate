"","TEXT_LUCKRA205_03791_SEQ_01<tab>The emergence of the dark force within Gaia has provided few answers to the questions that remain concerning its origin and true purpose. With the mysterious entity nowhere to be seen and its host having regained her senses, the rest of the group resume the plan to revitalize the element of ice, this time using Shiva as a basis for the summoning. Upon hearing of the manner in which Ysayle made herself a vessel for the primal's power, Ryne states her desire to use a similar approach. As ice naturally tends towards stasis and stillness, it is the element most closely aligned with Light, and would require far more effort to draw forth and rebalance. She claims this difficulty could be greatly alleviated by directly influencing the flow of aether by using her own body as a conduit, rather than relying solely on Eden. Your role, as ever, is to defeat the primal, although considerable care must be taken to disperse the aether without harming Ryne. As one might expect, Thancred vehemently opposes the plan at first, though he is forced to concede when met with the steely determination in her eyes. You and Ryne focus your thoughts on Shiva, and commence the summoning. With an even greater sense of trepidation than usual, you prepare for a climactic battle with the goddess of ice.
