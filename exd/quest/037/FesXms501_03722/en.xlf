There is, however, one child who is not feeling particularly festive: a boy by the name of Nalipponcque, who finds himself alone this eve despite a promise from his father─a bowman of the Gods' Quiver─that they would celebrate the holiday together. After the boy dejectedly wanders away, the celebrant muses that perhaps there is a way to return the smile to his face. To that end, she would have you visit one Piers at Quiver's Hold, that you might inquire as to the whereabouts of his colleague, the boy's father.</target>

He explains that Lartonphe, in particular, is an accomplished vocalist who will be one of the stars of the show. The bowman surmises that his colleague has been sneaking off in secret from his son to rehearse for his performance, and encourages you to seek him out and share with him his son's concerns. At Piers's suggestion, you decide to make for Bentbranch Meadows, where the crooning quiverman means to reunite with his loyal chocobo.</target>

He also mentions that he suggested that the quiverman take his chocobo companion for a walk by the gentle waters of the Jadeite Flood, in hopes of calming the bird's troubled heart. You resolve to venture that way yourself, and survey the surroundings to see if you cannot spot your quarry.</target>

Following your ear, you come upon Lartonphe and his feathered friend, who are practicing their singing on the shores of the Flood. As the quiverman tells it, the bird was not suffering from an ailment as he feared, but simply was stimulated by his voice, and anxious to join him in song and dance. He laments his own failures in causing his son grief during Starlight season, and resolves to make amends somehow. Man and chocobo then depart to prepare for the performance, but not before Lartonphe beseeches you to return to Amh Garanjy, and ask the celebrant to see to it that his son attends the concert.</target>

Convinced that nothing would make for a better Starlight gift to the boy than seeing his favorite bird take the stage with his father, the celebrant encourages you to return to Quiver's Hold and earnestly entreat the quiverman, while she sees to it that the boy does not wander off before the main event.</target>

Though he wants nothing more than to give his boy a joyous memory for Starlight, he fears that by his deception he has already alienated the poor child beyond repair. Just when the poor man seems to have lost all hope, the two of you are joined by a most illustrious trio: Miah Molkot of the White Rams, Guildmaster Luciane, and Bowlord Lewin himself. They remind the querulous quiverman of his sworn duty to keep the Twelveswood at peace, and gently point out that going forward with his Starlight performance as promised is a vital part of this. The three illustrious archers offer to cooperate in whatever way they can, after which you provide the final spark of motivation he needs with your inspired proposal that he bring his chocobo companion on stage─a suggestion to which both man and bird eagerly agree. The matter settled to everyone's satisfaction, you set off for Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to report the triumphant news to Amh Garanjy.</target>
