She also takes an interest in the pod, though its sudden return to functionality puts something of a damper on her plans to fiddle with its innards, and a clever device of her own design soon reveals a third exciting discovery─the motionless form of 9S, who, like 2P, must have lost the ability to function after your pitched battle. Though Anogg is willing to cooperate with 2P, that willingness evidently does not extend to outright trust, as she opts to keep 9S both intact and secret from the other android without hesitation.</target>
