Should you be inclined to heed its call, seek out Chaqurl Qhotl and see how you might best proceed.

But there is more troubling news at hand─Towarl Manol's symptoms have returned with a vengeance, and the sickness that afflicts her appears to be spreading about the Stopple. At the behest of the Qitari father and son, you resolve to travel to Fanow in their stead to acquire an additional supply of medicine from your Viis friends.</target>

Deeply concerned for the well-being of your forest-dwelling friends, you set off for the Stopple once more, hoping that the remedy will provide a temporary respite from the suffering until such time as a cure can be found.</target>

As the young Qitari struggles to come to grips with the situation, Quinfort rushes to the scene in a panic and confirms your worst fears─the Night's Blessed of Slitherbough, too, have been stricken with the strange sickness, and your friend Valan lies unconscious in bed as you speak. Deeply distressed at this turn of events─and at the thought that the Qitari themselves might be responsible for spreading the disease around the Greatwood—Chaqurl resigns himself to calling off the excavation effort until a cure can be found, but is convinced otherwise by a timely interruption from the Great Serpent of Ronka. Believing this to be a sign that the very answer he seeks might be found in the tunnels below, he proclaims that the excavation will go on. Admiring the Qitari child's courage and composure in trying times, you resolve to speak to him and give him the encouragement he needs to go exploring without his father at his side.</target>

As the Qitari child tells it, unlike the previous three, it is in pristine condition, and the etchings upon it appear to provide the very answer that you seek. Guided by the divine wisdom of the great serpent, you resolve to scour the forest for the rare variety of Ronkan moss that may stay the spread of the terrible pox that now plagues the forest.</target>

Troubled by the implications and yet taking heart that it was the wisdom of his forefathers that quelled the epidemic, he vows that the Stewards will be vigilant against any similar outbreaks in the future. With the four stelae finally unearthed and restored to their original form, the Qitari resolve to continue their excavation and study, that further lost knowledge may be gleaned.</target>
