Almet and her sisters have discovered hitherto unexplored chambers in the Qitana Ravel that may offer new insight into the Ascians and their motives. She extends an offer to join, though her tone leaves no room for refusal. And so you depart for Fanow, where Almet is already expecting your arrival.</target>

Now that you have arrived, the time has come to plumb its depths in search of yet more ancient knowledge.</target>

That is, until Uimet unwittingly picks up an owl statue near a sealed chamber door. The chamber's guardian soon springs to life, the sight of its ferocious frame duly compensating for any lack of danger thus far. Yet for all its strength, it still proves no match for you and your comrades. With its final, shuddering breath, the seal on the chamber door is broken.</target>

Her mastery of spellcraft was without peer, and it is said she was possessed of a gift suspiciously similar to the Echo. A curious revelation, which proves more than mere coincidence after Y'shtola examines a mural within the chamber. Its inscription suggests this ability was awakened after beholding a starshower. The mural itself depicts a scene not unlike one you witnessed at the start of your adventures many moons ago, and another more recently in Amaurot. This potential link between starshowers and the Echo has given you and Y'shtola much to think about as you return to Fanow.</target>
