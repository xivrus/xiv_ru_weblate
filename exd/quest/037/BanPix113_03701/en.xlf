Did you know, these little darlings are descended from sheep who once lived high in the mountains? That would explain why they love this grass more than any other.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="57" approved="yes"><source>57</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX113_03701_SHEEPPIXIE_000_032&lt;tab&gt;So, Anden, what do you think of your flock now?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="58" approved="yes"><source>58</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX113_03701_SHEEPPIXIE_000_033&lt;tab&gt;Oh, you're not familiar? Anden was a shepherd who used to live on a cliff overlooking Longmirror Lake.
