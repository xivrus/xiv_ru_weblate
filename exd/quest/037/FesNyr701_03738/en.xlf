        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR701_03738_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With your attention duly taken by his traditional kabuto, the ushi bugyo takes the opportunity to introduce himself as this year's delegate from the Far East, come to share their customs with the people of Eorzea during the Heavensturn celebration. Plans for the revelry are proceeding apace...or so the ushi bugyo thought. The pounding of rice for advent cakes should be nearing completion─assuming it has not already finished─and yet there has been nary a word from the pounding site. Fearing something has gone amiss, the ushi bugyo asks you to investigate in his stead.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR701_03738_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You arrive at the site to find sentient mochi, and judging by its seemingly disgruntled disposition, it has developed a desire to deal out poundings rather than take them. After much hacking, slashing, and all manner of beatings reminiscent of pounding, the mochi at last grows still, its remains the perfect size to roll into advent cakes. The ushi bugyo is certain to take an interest in your unorthodox methods of preparing this traditional treat of the Far East.</target>

A seemingly monotonous way of cooking, but I assure you it can be quite fun, and the end result is a most delectable treat.</target>
