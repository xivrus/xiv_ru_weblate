        <target state="final">TEXT_BANQIQ006_03799_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;At Hopl's Stopple, Chaqurl Qhotl reflects upon recent events in the Greatwood. While he regrets the role his people played in spreading the sickness about the forest, he is heartened that the Qitari contributed to stopping the spread of the disease through the wisdom of their forefathers. But this triumph was not achieved alone, and Chaqurl would thank his friends who dwell throughout the wood for their aid and support in a time of need. You resolve to first accompany him to Fanow, where he would express his gratitude to Master Lanille and the Viis.
