This marvelous record of long-forgotten affairs shows them deep in conversation regarding the summoning of Hydaelyn, of all things, which was apparently spearheaded by a personage named “Venat.” Further prodding causes the device to divulge a single additional memory that reveals this Venat became Hydaelyn's heart─and Elidibus, Zodiark's.</target>
