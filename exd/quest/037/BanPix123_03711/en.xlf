Mortal children seem to love them, so I thought─why not try it out? Then I hid in a log for five days and five nights, and no one found me. It was &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;amazing&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;! Then I got bored, so I came back.</target>

And that means that they can't make hideouts! I mean, sure, they could hide &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;in&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; the village, but people would find them.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANPIX123_03711_UINNEE_000_004&lt;tab&gt;I decided right then and there that I would dream up a perfect hiding place for those poor little darlings. And what better to make it from than one of those giant mushrooms the Nu Mou live in? Nothing! There's nothing better. It was a rhetorical question.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANPIX123_03711_UINNEE_000_005&lt;tab&gt;Tragically, Father Collard's Chambers is absolutely swarming with the lawless ones, which makes it impossible to harvest mushroom spawn. If something isn't done, my brilliant plan will never come to fruition, and...I'm sure you can see where this is going. Do it for the children!</target>

We should be able to grow this one nice and tall, then pop it into a dream, and...voilà! Greatest hideout ever. We don't even need to put it in a dank old cave! Imagine the possibilities...</target>
