After expressing confidence that her efforts will eventually bear fruit, he concludes the best course of action for the rest of you would be to wait─which, Alphinaud points out, means that you now have the opportunity to look in on the Exarch and ascertain how his efforts to perfect the spirit vessel are coming along.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKMH110_03770_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You find the Exarch not in his tower, but at the Exedra, surrounded by a crowd of overexcited citizens. It seems the words of “Ardbert” have had the intended effect, kindling such heroic zeal in the people that they are ready to leave their homes without thought to the consequences. As if to compound matters, the sky suddenly turns dark, heralding the arrival of a shower of stars─a spectacle which awakens the crowd to a voice you know very well indeed. With perfect timing, Elidibus appears, proclaiming to those who hear it that they, too, are Warriors of Light, before departing as abruptly as he came. You catch up with him a short distance away, and though he offers no clarity on the subject of his motives, he does confirm that the meteors were an illusion of his own making. With an ominous promise to save the world, he vanishes─leaving you to ponder what all of this implies about Hydaelyn's own role in the creation of Warriors of Light...including you.</target>

Rather than stake everything on the success of Y'shtola's investigations, Thancred proposes he use his ample experience in subterfuge to keep watch over Elidibus, and all readily agree. Urianger, meanwhile, will assist in ongoing research at the Umbilicus─for confident though Beq Lugg and the Exarch are of developing a means to transfer memory into spirit vessels, a great deal of experimentation yet remains. Needful tasks thus assigned, the Exarch suggests you take the opportunity to rest─a statement rife with irony, perhaps, given its source, but one not lacking in wisdom.</target>
