Forced to concede that she may have a point, Konogg agrees to help─though not without complaint. It seems you will be searching for that power source after all.</target>

She sends you off to the Dwarven Hollows to seek one out while she and Konogg consider the problem of how said energy might be harnessed for your purposes.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKTA210_03785_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Though you provide the crystal to Anogg, successful implementation will require an amount of experimentation. The twins are keen to begin, but unfortunately for them, they are interrupted before they can so much as connect a whatsit to a thingamabob by the dig site chief, who will brook no further delay in the completion of their preparations for the upcoming carnival. As they grudgingly leave their work in the tunnels behind, he encourages you to attend the event. What exactly it entails remains a mystery, but one thing is certain: there will be drinking.</target>
