Realizing Lord Varis had no reason to be present at the citadel, he strains to remember who was the source of this anguished memory. In an instant his mind becomes clear, and the visage of Lord Varis is replaced by the man who shot him so many years ago─his own father, Midas nan Garlond. What's more, a closer inspection reveals he is in fact a thrall of the dreadwyrm Bahamut. With the mystery of Cid's past brought to light, you return to the waking world with the inscriptions of the blades of Gunnhildr, as well as an onerous truth.</target>
