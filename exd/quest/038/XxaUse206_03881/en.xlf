The only ones who have yet to be located are a trio who were engaged in a game of hide-and-seek. It would seem that the children are very serious when it comes to the game, and will not move from their hiding spots unless found, leaving you with no choice but to find them yourself.</target>

Many would consider it a valuable skill, to be sure─albeit one Hozan hopes the children never need to use.</target>
