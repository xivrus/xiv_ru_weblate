His work is nearly complete, but there is one final component that he cannot obtain on his own: three ice sprite cores, which he has asked you to bring to him.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_XXAUSB914_03869_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Cid's efforts are ultimately for naught, as Inquisitor Guillaime makes another unannounced visit and warns the chirurgeons against accepting gifts from foreigners who have interfered with the trial of an accused heretic. The revelation shocks the chirurgeons, who immediately reject Cid's newly constructed alembic. The inquisitor appears to have developed a hatred for you and your associates, and it has become increasingly clear that he will do his utmost to prevent you from achieving your goals.</target>
