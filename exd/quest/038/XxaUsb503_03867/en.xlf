				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_XXAUSB503_03867_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;When tending to the bodies of the recently deceased, Marques came across a broken horologe. The contraption is strangely familiar to the refugee, and he hopes that, by tinkering with it, he will recall its significance. Marques requests that you assist him by acquiring the necessary tools: a bull-point chisel, and a pair of needle-nose pincers, both of which should be available in Camp Drybone.</target>

Apologizing for the inconvenience, he bids you take the device to Sister Eluned, who is currently tending to the body of its owner outside the church.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_XXAUSB503_03867_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Sister Eluned has never before seen an intricate device like the horologe, which is reminiscent of the technological marvels Garlemald is said to possess. The brief association causes her to suspect that the deceased owner may have been a Garlean spy, and she considers informing the Immortal Flames stationed in Camp Drybone. However, Marques's ability to repair the horologe appears to be an even more stunning revelation, one which also bears further investigation.</target>
