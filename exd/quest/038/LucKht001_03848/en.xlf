Their aim is to perfect several prototype field and tradecraft tools unearthed from the manufactory's storehouse, and they require the assistance of a person skilled in such crafts to test and help improve said tools. Given that you are such a person, you agree to help─and with no further ado receive an eminently serviceable prototype for your trouble.</target>
