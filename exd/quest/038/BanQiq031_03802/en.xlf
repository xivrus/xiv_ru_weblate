        <target state="final">TEXT_BANQIQ031_03802_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Convinced of the merits of Qitarl Natl's argument, you express your support for his theory that his people were originally hunted by the Viis, a vote of confidence that pleases the Qitari steward greatly. Grudgingly agreeing that his father may have a point, the Qitari youngling Chaqurl Qhotl agrees to assist in the restoration of the second stela.
