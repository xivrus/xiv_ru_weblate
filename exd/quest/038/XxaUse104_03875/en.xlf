During their tearful reunion, Minfilia explains that her father was once a member of the Ala Mhigan Resistance, and that following his death in a tragic accident, F'lhaminn raised her as her own. After praising Minfilia for her victories over the Empire, F'lhaminn states that the Scions must leave Ul'dah behind if they are to continue their work. Agreeing at last to Alphinaud's proposal, a reinvigorated Minfilia declares that the order will quit Vesper Bay and establish a new headquarters in Revenant's Toll.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_XXAUSE104_03875_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Report to Minfilia at the Waking Sands.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_XXAUSE104_03875_SYSTEM_100_000&lt;tab&gt;To accept this quest, you must abandon the current main scenario quest.
