        <target state="final">TEXT_BANDWA003_03898_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The next essential piece of the Rolling Tankard prototype is its cannon, though Ronitt is unsure how best to proceed. He comes to the conclusion that utilizing condensed aether should prove effective in combating sin eaters, although this is a field in which none of the dwarves present have any experience. Regitt recommends seeking the advice of Lorathia, who was once an engineer at the Crystarium.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANDWA003_03898_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Ronitt arrives in Clearmelt to ask Lorathia whether she has any knowledge of aether-based weaponry. Fate conspires once again to bless him with outrageous fortune when Lorathia reveals she is in fact the very person who designed the crystal cannons that line the Crystarium. However, rather than go into any further details regarding this, Lorathia instead invites you to a tea party with her two friends, Iriolva and Cobleva. These elderly twins own merchant caravans that deliver goods across Norvrandt, and they are looking for a way to fend off sin eaters. Lorathia points out that this is an opportunity for Ronitt to secure buyers for his tanks, although his lack of social decorum requires that you be on hand to guide him through this informal exchange. </target>
