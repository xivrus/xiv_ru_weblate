        <target state="final">TEXT_BANDWA002_03897_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With the prototype Rolling Tankard nearing completion, it dawns on Ronitt that he has yet to find a suitable fuel to power it, and he gathers his comrades for an exchange of ideas. Their discussion has barely begun when they notice the presence of a mysterious interloper─Ozogg of the Gogg, one of their archrivals. She claims to be descended from Watts, much like Ronitt, to whom she issues a challenge: a test of engineering skill, with rightful claim to Watts's hammer at stake. Ronitt eventually accepts, but on the condition that Ozogg wait until he has finished work on the Rolling Tankard prototype. Having overheard their discussion of fuel, Ozogg offers her village's secret formula to expedite their upcoming showdown, but only if she is supplied with booze beforehand. Much to her dismay, the other dwarves inform her they have no ale to share, nor the means to produce any. Ozogg offers to oversee the construction of a brewery and appoints you as her assistant. Like most present, Ronitt finds this sequence of events absolutely baffling, but if the end result is fuel for his work and workers both, he is all for it.
