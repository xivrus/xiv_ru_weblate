        <target state="final">TEXT_XXAUSE119_03878_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Minfilia's father, Warburton, was a Garlean spy whose true loyalties lay with the Ala Mhigan Resistance. Before his untimely death some fifteen years ago, he stole a wealth of imperial research on the primals, and compiled the findings in his private journal. Though this journal has served to guide Minfilia ever since, she has resolved─after no small amount of soul-searching─to entrust it to Urianger, in the hope that he may succeed in unraveling its remaining mysteries. Present Warburton's journal to Urianger on Minfilia's behalf.</target>

Fearing the worst, Minfilia bids Urianger do everything he can to determine the cause of their uncharacteristic silence.
