				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_XXAUSE119_03878_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Minfilia's father, Warburton, was a Garlean spy whose true loyalties lay with the Ala Mhigan Resistance. Before his untimely death some fifteen years ago, he stole a wealth of imperial research on the primals, and compiled the findings in his private journal. Though this journal has served to guide Minfilia ever since, she has resolved─after no small amount of soul-searching─to entrust it to Urianger, in the hope that he may succeed in unraveling its remaining mysteries. Present Warburton's journal to Urianger on Minfilia's behalf.</target>

The distant yet dependable Students of Baldesion are no longer responding to his messages. Fearing the worst, Minfilia bids Urianger do everything he can to determine the cause of their uncharacteristic silence. For the time being, however, the Scions have no choice but to continue their work without the aid of one of their closest allies.</target>
