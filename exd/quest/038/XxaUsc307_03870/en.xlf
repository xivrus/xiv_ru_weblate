Although this ravenous beast tends to conceal its whereabouts, Hedyn has the perfect lure to draw him into the open: the unusually named true heart. Make your way into the lair of the spriggans and use the true heart to lure out and slay Giggity.</target>

Hopefully Cid will have developed a less irksome way to do the same...</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_XXAUSC307_03870_HEDYN_000_013&lt;tab&gt;Permit me to explain. You are familiar with spriggans, yes? The furry little rascals that are wont to seek out ores and other stones? Well, one such creature with an infamously insatiable appetite has single-handedly devoured every corrupted crystal in the Twelveswood. Fortunately for you, these crystals take an eternity to digest─assuming they can even &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;be&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; digested─and I am reasonably confident that one still resides within his gut.</target>
