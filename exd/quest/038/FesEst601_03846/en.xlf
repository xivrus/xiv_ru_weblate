        <target state="final">TEXT_FESEST601_03846_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, you come upon Jihli Aliapoh, who regales you with the history of the event known as Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide─a festival born of her vision of the Twelve Archons of the Sixth Umbral Era. As she tells it, this year she was blessed with another vision: this one not of storied heroes, but of fluffy rabbits─which may in part explain her curious appearance. Though what she has in mind is not immediately clear, one thing is: she requires your aid to make the festival a success. Should you be inclined to lend your assistance, seek out her colleague Nonotta by the Carline Canopy and see what you might do on the celebrants' behalf.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
