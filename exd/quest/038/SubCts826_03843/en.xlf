You may have just taken up your rod, but anyone can see you've got the keen eye of a fisherman, and I reckon you're looking to make that eye keener still. Bigger fish, more exotic locales─aye, that's what we all seek, ain't it? And it just so happens, I can tell you how to find them!</target>

I've heard tell you're a big fisher in a small pond, and by the looks of it the rumors are true. But what if I told you there were bigger ponds out there, and bigger fish besides?

I suppose the concept becomes something of an afterthought when one becomes so focused on water's surface. Regardless, I am here to ensure the ship adheres to its schedule, both by managing its finances and ensuring new crew members board smoothly.</target>

If you're lookin' for other kinds of bait, you can buy it here on the docks or on the ship. Try to switch it up now and then, because if you only use the same bait, you're only gonna keep catchin' the same fish, and that ain't why we do this, is it?</target>

So when I say we're fishin' here or we're sailin' there, I won't hear no objections. As long as we're clear on that, I believe there'll be bounteous fishin' for all.</target>
