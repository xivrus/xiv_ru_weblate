It would seem your singular ability to coax the great serpent into obedience with a mere whistle has made you quite the commodity. Uterl Matl was just asking after you, and requested that I send you his way with haste. The matter seemed quite urgent─so urgent, in fact, that he ran off before I had a chance to inquire as to the details!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANQIQ127_03832_UTERLMATL_000_010&lt;tab&gt;Ah, good &lt;var 08 E905 ((madam)) ((sir)) /var&gt;, let me thank you for answering my summons on such short notice. My time spent with the great serpent has given me a certain intuition when it comes to anticipating its needs, and recently I've noticed something peculiar about its behavior.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="50" approved="yes"><source>50</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANQIQ127_03832_UTERLMATL_000_011&lt;tab&gt;It fidgets inside the vase restlessly, but I don't sense that it yearns for freedom. No, this is another matter entirely. It wishes to free something from within &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;itself&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;─doubtless that mystifying light it has a habit of disgorging from its eyes.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANQIQ127_03832_UTERLMATL_000_012&lt;tab&gt;I must admit I am grateful for the serpent's forbearance in the matter, when it is we who are obliged to serve.

Pray bring the serpent to Fruit of the Protector, where it can shed light to its little heart's content.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="52" approved="yes"><source>52</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANQIQ127_03832_UTERLMATL_000_013&lt;tab&gt;You've arrived just in time!

Oh, I see! What an unorthodox request.
