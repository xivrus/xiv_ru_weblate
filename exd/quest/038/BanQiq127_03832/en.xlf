        <target state="final">TEXT_BANQIQ127_03832_QHOTERLPASOL_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Ah, such splendid timing! It would seem your singular ability to coax the great serpent into obedience with a mere whistle has made you quite the commodity. Uterl Matl was just asking after you, and requested that I send you his way with haste. The matter seemed quite urgent─so urgent, in fact, that he ran off before I had a chance to inquire as to the details!</target>

My time spent with the great serpent has given me a certain intuition when it comes to anticipating its needs, and recently I've noticed something peculiar about its behavior.</target>

No, this is another matter entirely. It wishes to free something from within &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;itself&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;─doubtless that mystifying light it has a habit of disgorging from its eyes.</target>

And serve we shall─with your help, of course. Pray bring the serpent to Fruit of the Protector, where it can shed light to its little heart's content.</target>
