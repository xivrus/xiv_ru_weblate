This blessing will provide a steady supply of sustenance as we dig deeper. That is, of course, if we can catch the fish.</target>

However, a fruit worm &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;may&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; suffice to catch what we need. Go to Mjrl's Regret with fruit worm on hook, and bring us back a splendid larva.</target>
