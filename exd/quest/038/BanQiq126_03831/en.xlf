This blessing will provide a steady supply of sustenance as we dig deeper. That is, of course, if we can catch the fish.</target>

Those in the Husk are fat from feasting on the remains littering the area. My workers and I would be grateful if you would bring us some─for the fish, of course, not for us!</target>

However, a fruit worm &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;may&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; suffice to catch what we need. Go to Mjrl's Regret with fruit worm on hook, and bring us back a splendid larva.</target>

It fills our bellies, but I'm of the philosophy that a meal is meant to be savored. Perhaps finally we can forget the fact that we're toiling away under the earth, if even just for one meal.</target>
