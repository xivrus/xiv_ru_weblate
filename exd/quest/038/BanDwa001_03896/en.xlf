It seems that he has set his sights on the Crystarium, where he hopes to track you down, for reasons that are as yet unclear. You kindly agree to accompany Regitt and unravel the mysteries surrounding Ronitt's sudden departure.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANDWA001_03896_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Ronitt is, as Regitt had predicted, cowering in a corner, seemingly overwhelmed by the presence of so many “big folk” in one place. Before long, Katliss of the Mean comes to make the acquaintance of the two dwarves, which in turn prompts Ronitt to reveal why he has journeyed to the Crystarium. Until recently, he was under the impression that you were little more than a passing traveler. Having been informed of your heroic achievements, however, he is now determined to perform great deeds of his own, so as not to be outdone by you, his dear friend. As he cannot hope to compete with you in terms of martial prowess, he instead hopes to improve the lives of the various peoples of the realm through his skills as an engineer. Much to his surprise─and no small amount of chagrin─you reveal that you too have an affinity for crafting, to which Ronitt responds by suggesting that the two of you cooperate in helping the Crystalline Mean. Katliss explains that roving sin eaters have taken to attacking merchant caravans of late, and she is looking for a means of transporting their goods across Lakeland without placing the traders at risk. Ronitt toys with the idea of using his existing line of automata as a possible solution, but comes to the conclusion that major improvements must be carried out, necessitating the need for a large and fully furnished workshop. Katliss then offers the use of an area in Lakeland once designated to the Mean, though you will first need to gain the permission of Lorathia, the land owner, who is known to frequent the baths at Clearmelt.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANDWA001_03896_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Ronitt and Regitt get off to a bumpy start with Lorathia, who is not one to tolerate any of their endearing dwarven impertinence. Upon hearing of the plan to upgrade Ronitt's automata, she immediately dismisses the idea, as the current design lacks both the storage capacity for transporting cargo and the weaponry needed to fend off sin eaters. It then dawns on Ronitt that he has been carrying the solution about his person the entire time, and produces from his pocket a blueprint for a tanklike vehicle originally designed by his ancestor and famed engineer, Watts, which he aptly dubbed the “Rolling Tankard.” With room inside for large quantities of goods and a cannon capable of dealing with threats from a distance, all that remains is to actually build one. A task easier said than done, it would seem, as the designs do not show any of its inner workings. Not one to be discouraged, Ronitt claims he will be able to employ modern techniques to finish what would have been impossible in Watts's day. Lorathia eventually caves in and allows the use of her land, mainly out of curiosity, as she too was once an engineer. Ronitt goes ahead to survey the site of the new workshop, with automaton in tow, while Regitt heads back to Tomra to recruit volunteers to assist in building the tanks.</target>
