Some seemed quite intimidated at first to see a veritable army of oversized rabbits, but they quickly changed their tune after receiving the gift of extravagant eggs containing all manner of tasteful and toothsome treats!</target>

It is because of you that the parade was far and away the highlight of this year's festivities. Why, I was originally intending to stand aside and direct the procession, but everyone looked to be enjoying themselves so much, I simply had to take part myself!</target>
