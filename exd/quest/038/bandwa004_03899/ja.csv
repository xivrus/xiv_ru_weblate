"","TEXT_BANDWA004_03899_SEQ_01<tab>The newly completed Rolling Tankard prototype has been put through its paces, and a lack of screaming and charred earth indicates the final test run was successful. The next step is to produce more tanks, and for that, Ronitt requires a larger workshop. He calls a meeting with the other members of Watts's Anvil, but their talks are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Chief Xamott of the Tholl and Chief Glagg of the Gogg. Quite how these archrivals suffered each other's company long enough to reach Lakeland is unclear, but their ire for Ronitt and Ozogg's disobedience is palpable. Not only have aspiring inventors broken the strict code of their respective tribes, but they have each been accused of perpetrating heinous crimes. Ozogg of sharing Gogg technology with the Tholl, and Ronitt of stealing Watts's designs without permission, an act punishable by banishment. Although Ronitt is able to convince his chief of the importance of the Rolling Tankards, he is given an ultimatum: complete five tanks by the next Beardtide festival or he and the other Tholls will be sent back to Tomra. What's more, he must forfeit Watts's hammer should he fail. Such a grim prospect fails to dampen his determination, and he readily accepts the wager.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.

With no prying eyes or ears to hear, she confesses her resolve to never return home, making any punishment from her elders─even the threat of banishment similar to Ronitt─a matter of little concern. All she cares about is carrying on with her engineering, which has been her lifelong passion. She then goes on to share her childhood memories of meeting Ronitt as a boy and their all-too-brief encounter and her giving him a Gogg coin as a token of their friendship. Though Ronitt was too young to remember, Ozogg has fond recollections of that day, and her work at Watts's Anvil reminds her of the simple joy of crafting that she felt all those years ago. Though she insists that she is only here to challenge Ronitt as rightful heir to Watts's hammer, it seems that this may be merely a pretext for her to spend time with like-minded individuals.
