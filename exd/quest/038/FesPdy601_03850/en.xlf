Lady Aldiytha of House Thorne, ever a proponent of this special day, appears to know just where to start. She tells you of a downcast Lalafell with flaxen hair, whom she spied among the festive crowds, and enlists your aid in finding her. Hurry to Emerald Avenue, that you might find this troubled soul and set her heart at ease.

Lady Aldiytha is moved by Lorie's plight, and proposes bringing the merriment to Lorie and the other children in the ward.
