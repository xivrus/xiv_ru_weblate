        <target state="final">TEXT_XXAUSA801_03864_AIDEEN_000_002&lt;tab&gt;I somehow doubt that the answer's that simple, but for the sake of thoroughness, we should look into it. Why don't you put down, say, three of the creatures, and see if you can find any proof connecting them to the deaths?</target>

Aaanyway, I believe we can safely strike ziz from our list of suspects. Which leaves us with...the masked man and his winged eyeball!</target>
