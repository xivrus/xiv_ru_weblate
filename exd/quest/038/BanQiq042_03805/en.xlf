        <target state="final">TEXT_BANQIQ042_03805_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Convinced of the merits of Chaqurl Qhotl's argument, you express your support for his theory that the Qitari sought to share their food supply with the suffering catfish people, before the latter tribe's unfortunate disappearance from the forest. Grudgingly agreeing that his son may have a point, the stubborn Qitari agrees to assist in the restoration of the third stela.
