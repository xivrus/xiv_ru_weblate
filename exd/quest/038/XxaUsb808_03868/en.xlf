To help you obtain permission to enter the Stone Vigil, he writes for you a letter of introduction to Lord Drillemont of Whitebrim Front. However, he suspects that his endorsement alone will not suffice, and he advises you to ask Lord Francel to write a letter for you as well.</target>

Duly warned, proceed to Whitebrim Front and present your letters to the sentry at the gates.</target>

Well, it so happens that I was monitoring the night sky at the Observatorium during that period. I recall that a small vessel came from the direction of Gridania and landed near the Stone Vigil, in the far northwest.</target>

It shames me to say that it too was once an outpost held by House Haillenarte. In the chaos that followed the Calamity, the Dravanian Horde caught us unawares. The fiends have held the outpost ever since.</target>
