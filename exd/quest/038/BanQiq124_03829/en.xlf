Being the enterprising Qitari that I am, I've arranged to exchange our precious stones for their precious eggs. One of nature's bounties for another─a capital bargain if I do say so myself!</target>

I'd love to give them to you, but I'm afraid I've run into a snag. One of my chickens fled the coop, you see, clucking like the sky itself was falling down!</target>

Hmph, I mean, splendid! These eggs are even more pleasing to behold than the last batch, and there are so many of them! I would've sent one of my workers to fetch these, but the sad truth is that no Qitari could be trusted with the task. </target>
