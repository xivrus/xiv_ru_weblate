				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKSA050_03844_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Thanks to your efforts and Cid's cooperation, everything is in place to begin reforging the blades of Gunnhildr, arms Gerolt would now refer to as Resistance weapons. Before setting to work, however, Gerolt asks you to expound on your exploration of Cid's mind. This insight makes clear to him that the weapons require a final ingredient before they can be completed─a special powder highly conductive to aether. Much to his dismay, the one best suited to acquiring this for you is none other than Rowena. At the risk of incurring more debt, he asks you to meet with her in Kugane to make an arrangement on behalf of the Bozjan Resistance.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.</target>

With matters settled in Kugane, you return to Gangos, eager to see the fruits of Gerolt's labor.</target>
