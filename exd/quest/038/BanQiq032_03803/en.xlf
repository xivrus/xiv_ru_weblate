        <target state="final">TEXT_BANQIQ032_03803_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Convinced of the merits of Chaqurl Qhotl's argument, you express your support for his theory that the Qitari and the Viis enjoyed friendly relations from the earliest of days, a vote of confidence that pleases the child greatly. Grudgingly agreeing that his son may have a point, Qitarl Natl agrees to assist in the restoration of the second stela.
