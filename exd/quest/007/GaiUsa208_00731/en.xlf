Should you happen upon any such items while wandering the area, I would be most grateful if you'd bring them to me.</target>

Judging by the shape and ornamentation, they appear to be cups of the kind once used to serve herbal infusions...or possibly vegetable broth. Perfect!</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA208_00731_ROLANDAIX_000_022&lt;tab&gt;Gridanians have long perceived my people as outcasts and brigands, yet if we Duskwights can return a measure of prosperity to this fallen city, we would no longer need to resort to common theft or banditry in order to make ends meet. Imagine it!
...But I am rambling. Thank you for your help.</target>
