In order to find one such ochu, take the amber syrup given to you by Rosa and pour it on the curious tussock in the Honey Yard. Once uncovered, slay the ochu, and pray that you find some milkroot among its remains.</target>

When chewed, it exudes a cloudy liquid that's said to induce curious visions in the imbiber. You'd not catch me dead trying the stuff, but the sylphs seem to enjoy it to no end.</target>
