As Ianna tells it, however, the antelopes become enfeebled when doused with bits of sparhawk egg soup. Venture south of the Druthers, and utilize the soup given to you to help put down one of the scarred antelopes.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA204_00727_IANNA_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Recently, I shared a flagon with a merchant from Ul'dah, who regaled me with her tales of dangers from the road. Worst of all, as she had it, was the ferocious beast that nigh gored her within an ilm of her life just when she thought she'd reached the forest's safe embraces.</target>

Yes, I doubted mine own ears when I heard the tale, but 'twould seem a most ill-tempered strain of the beast roams the land south of the Druthers of late. You might recognize them by the scars they bear from frenzied battles with man and fellow beast alike.</target>

You may chuckle, but the spices contained within are known to sap the energy of these plant-eating beasts. Now go carefully, and don't let those doe eyes lull you into a false sense of security─lest the next ale you down spill freely from the myriad holes in your body.</target>
