Rumors have arisen that, in death, their rancor has gone into a rock to the southwest, causing it to flash and moan. Hopeful for a clue, Aideen bids you use a firesand stick to blow off pieces of the rock, and then bring back the fragments for her to examine.</target>

The stick doesn't come with a fuse or anything, so you'll have to &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;throw&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; the thing. Once you've torn the rock a new one, bring back some of the fragments, and I'll give them a gander.</target>
