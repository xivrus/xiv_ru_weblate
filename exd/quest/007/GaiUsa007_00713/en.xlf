        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA007_00713_PIRALNAUT_000_000&lt;tab&gt;You look to be made of sterner stuff than the average adventurer. How would you fancy doing your bit to preserve the peace? We patrol the area night and day, but a recent skirmish put a dozen of my best men in the infirmary, and we're sorely shorthanded as a result.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA007_00713_PIRALNAUT_000_002&lt;tab&gt;I'd be grateful if you could help fill in for the wounded. Now, there are three strategic positions on our patrol route, each marked by a Twin Adder standard. What you need to do is go to the three locations in turn and hold your ground for a while. Nothing to it, see?</target>

...A run-in with fell fiends, you say? That is passing odd. We have never had trouble with the local fauna on this patrol route in the past.</target>
