I am Florimond, a sentry of Josselin's Spire...though you would be forgiven for imagining me a sentry of this hut, so seldom have I left it in recent days.

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA005_00711_FLORIMOND_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Anyway, my Wood Wailer comrades are about to commence a culling operation in the Bramble Patch, and the thought of them marching into the jaws of danger while I languish here like a coddled babe is frankly too much to bear. I realize this is sudden, but might I trouble you to take part in the operation in my stead? If you would do me this favor, seek out Captain Aniud at Josselin's Spire. He will tell you all you need to know.</target>
