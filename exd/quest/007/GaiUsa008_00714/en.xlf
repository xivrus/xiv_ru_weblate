Your sharp-eyed mien tells me you're keen to prove yourself, and─to your good fortune─I've a, uh, menial task ideal for one of your fair-to-middling abilities. Wild boars plague the Bramble Patch, and it's about time that someone culled the herd. Well? Hop to it, now.</target>

Josselin's Spire overlooks a hub of trade and military activity, and to shirk my duties would be a dishonor to the hero whose name the spire bears.
