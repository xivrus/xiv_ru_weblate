With these new discoveries, he has enough information to advance his studies for the time being.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA304_00736_TANGATOTUNGA_000_035&lt;tab&gt;Ah, yes, these are fine specimens. These long narrow bones likely belonged to some sort of giant sea creature devoured by Thalaos. From the looks of it, I'd say it was about the size of an adult goobbue, all told.</target>

I have found countless others like it concentrated near the remains. These are good finds, my friend. Both are testaments to the sheer enormity of Thalaos.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA304_00736_TANGATOTUNGA_000_037&lt;tab&gt;Ah, forgive me. We scholars tend to assume all know as much of our subject matter as we. Do you know of the tale of Thalaos? It is said Llymlaen summoned the massive serpent upon the primordial dry, and from its belly it spewed forth the waters which became the seas.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA304_00736_TANGATOTUNGA_000_038&lt;tab&gt;We have no proof the remains that lie here are &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;the&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; Thalaos. Indeed, whatever beast this was first came to be called that by virtue of its size alone. But I, for one, now dare to believe. It just may be that these bones are those of the divine serpent that brought life into this world.</target>
