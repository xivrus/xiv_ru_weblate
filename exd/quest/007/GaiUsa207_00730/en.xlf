Would you fancy a flagon of ale, or perhaps─ah, an adventurer! I can scarce believe my fortune.

Please, pay them a visit at the ruins and see if aught's amiss. You're looking for one by the name of “Irielle,” by the way. I...ah...forget the other one's name.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSA207_00730_IRIELLE_000_010&lt;tab&gt;Yes, may I help you with something?
