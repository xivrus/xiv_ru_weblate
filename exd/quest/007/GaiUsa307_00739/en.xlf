To ease his mind, Auphiliot would have you speak with a Coeurlclaw poacher and a flyer for the Redbelly Wasps, and ask that they keep an eye out for any Garleans they might spy.</target>

He also had you meet the poacher and the flyer so that they would know who you are, and that you do not fear them. He hopes such meetings will serve to make you ever more useful to the proprietor and clientele of Buscarron's Druthers.</target>
