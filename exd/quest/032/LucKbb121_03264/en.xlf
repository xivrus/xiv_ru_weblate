				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKBB121_03264_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The Yellowjacket Futag Yafutag gives a brief outline of your mission, revealing that the person you will be protecting is Guldweitz, former head of the much reviled Flaming Mongrels. While Radovan and Sophie both have reservations about guarding a notorious criminal, Futag explains that the pirate has handed himself in and wishes to testify, implicating countless members of Limsa Lominsa's underworld. Naturally, there are many who would prefer that Guldweitz's silence be made a permanent arrangement, meaning that the assignment to escort him from the Moraby Drydocks is a particularly dangerous one. After Futag departs, Radovan points out the risks of relying solely on the information provided by the client, and suggests asking the Lominsan citizens about Guldweitz and the Flaming Mongrels.</target>

Guldweitz and his gang are believed to have had a hand in almost every case of extortion, with their moneylenders preying on businesses and individuals throughout the city. Many citizens would be glad to see Guldweitz behind bars or even executed for his crimes, and it is plain to see that the man has no shortage of enemies.</target>

She also explains that Futag has been ordered to return to his post, while she is charged with moving Guldweitz to a more secure location until the enemies lying in wait can be eliminated. Though Futag is clearly displeased with the sudden turn of events, he reluctantly informs you, Radovan, and Sophie that your contract has been fulfilled and that your services are no longer required. Radovan, on the other hand, refuses to leave the job half-finished and chases after Guldweitz's newly assigned escort.</target>

She questions why Radovan is denying her vengeance for her friend's death, for which she holds Guldweitz responsible. Radovan states that he gave his word to protect him and that the prisoner is acting for the good of Limsa Lominsa. The Yellowjacket, swayed by this reasoning, lowers her axe and is placed under arrest by Futag, who arrives just in time to witness the aftermath of this unfortunate incident. Your mission, despite being severely waylaid, resumes as per your original instructions, but before you leave, Guldweitz expresses his gratitude to Radovan. After discovering that he is suffering from an incurable disease, Guldweitz came to the realization that people like him are reason why so many Lominsans are dragged into a life of crime. By removing himself and the ones he would implicate from circulation, he hopes to tip the scales in the favor of law and order. These words give you and your friends food for thought as you continue the journey to Limsa Lominsa.</target>
