As was the case in your earlier encounter with Leviathan, this particular incarnation is likely to differ considerably from the Lord of Crags you fought all those moons ago.

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA105_03259_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Ryne guides Eden back to the camp, optimistic that the influx of revitalized aether has led to further alterations in the Empty. The area surrounding the lake has undergone a dramatic transformation, with immense, rocky outcrops having appeared as if from nowhere. However, the change seems to have only affected a relatively small region, though according to Urianger, this is most likely due to the aetherial currents intersecting at this point, and posits that similar phenomena may be occurring elsewhere. Though there is reason to be optimistic, the conversation is cut short when Ryne suddenly drops to her knees, apparently overcome by sheer exhaustion.</target>
