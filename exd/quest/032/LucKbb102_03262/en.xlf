Instead of employing traditional methods, Radovan would rather you learned on the job, and suggests seeking work in Gridania. Since he and Sophie are newcomers to the Shroud, you suggest that they make the Adventurers' Guild their first port of call.</target>

In addition to receiving a death threat, she narrowly escaped being injured by a stone thrown during a recent performance. In his capacity as her manager, Lassenchou has ordered that she remain inside until the perpetrator can be brought to justice. However, the musician has expressed her reluctance to remain confined any longer and insists upon taking an invigorating stroll through the sun-dappled groves of Gridania. As your task is to keep her safe from harm during the outing, Radovan suggests scouting the area and questioning the locals to ascertain the nature of those who seek to intimidate Editha.</target>

Her views are in line with the general consensus that the person threatening Editha is likely to be one of her admirers, although Radovan avoids jumping to conclusions for the time being, deciding to view anyone and all with equal suspicion. Although he would prefer to obtain more reliable information before beginning the assignment, he decides against keeping the client waiting for longer than necessary.</target>

Though Radovan is clearly exasperated that your charge has next to no chance of remaining undetected, he formulates a plan of action, wherein you and your mentor will lead the mission while Lassenchou and Sophie remain behind, ready to provide support if needed. Upon embarking on what is supposed to be a sedate promenade through Gridania, you are soon accosted by bandits and savage creatures, all commanded by an enigmatic masked woman.</target>

She, like Editha, is a harpsichordist, although her popularity waned as her followers deserted her in favor of her young rival. Her hatred festering within her, Ondine sought the cooperation of local highwaymen, and even hired them to assassinate Editha on the road through the Shroud. In a bizarre turn of events, Sophie's distinctive Viera ears were mistaken for the musician's trademark bunny crown adornment, leading the bandits to attack Sophie instead. While your assignment has ended successfully, there is one more matter Editha wishes to discuss with you in private─a secret to which even her manager Lassenchou cannot be made privy.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKBB102_03262_SEQ_08&lt;tab&gt;In a secluded corner of the Greatloam Growery, Editha reveals her true identity: she is in fact a disguised sylph. Dispelling her glamour, she explains that she has been visiting Gridania and enchanting the crowds with her prodigious harpsichord playing, with no one suspecting a thing, least of all Lassenchou. Although she was under no obligation to share this secret with you, she felt that since you risked your lives to protect her, you deserved to know the truth. She also states that her desire to walk outside was not merely a selfish whim, but one born of the utmost necessity, as sylphs wilt and eventually die if deprived of the sun's rays. After Editha says her farewells, Radovan takes the opportunity to tell you more of the gunbreaker's origins and his clan's place in keeping their traditions alive. Since he is the last survivor of his people, it is his duty to pass the art of the gunblade on to the next generation, with you as the prime candidate to become his successor. While the burden is indeed a heavy one, he is committed to helping you gain the necessary skills and experience. As they intend to broaden their horizons, Sophie and Radovan suggest moving on to Ul'dah to seek out their next client.

※In order to travel to Ul'dah, you must first complete the main scenario quest “&lt;var 09 E947 ((The Lominsan Envoy)) ((The Gridanian Envoy)) ((The Ul'dahn Envoy)) /var&gt;.”</target>
