Though he seems to be in good health, he has yet to forge a new partnership with another Virtue-hunter, and so the elderly woman hopes that you can put aside whatever negative feelings you may harbor against the youth, and go to the Crystarium to see how he is faring.</target>

They were overmatched, however, and nearly slaughtered to a man, leaving a sole survivor of the battle to recount the tale to others at the Crystarium. Others then left to take up the hunt in their fallen comrades' stead, Lue-Reeq among them. Most likely he is still in the Greatwood─assuming he is still alive...</target>

Though Lue-Reeq is at first unsure how to reconcile this behavior with his knowledge of Renda-Rae's past, you explain that in truth she did not defeat Balam&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Quitz alone, but rather with the aid of her fellow Warriors of Light. Finally recognizing his folly, the young lordling at last begs your forgiveness for his harsh words, and asks that you return with him to Gatetown to speak with Miss Olvara before you prepare for your final confrontation with Andreia.</target>
