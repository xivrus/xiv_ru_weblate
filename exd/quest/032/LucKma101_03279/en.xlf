Apparently, your colleagues have discovered a pathway leading to the bottom of the ravine in which the Crystal Tower stands, rendering its base accessible. Despite narrowing down the search area, however, it seems there is still a lot of ground to cover. According to Tataru, a boat waits on the northern edge of Silvertear Lake, ready to ferry helping hands over to the newly established survey site.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKMA101_03279_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You cross over to the eastern shore, and enter the expansive hollow at the foot of the Crystal Tower.

This time, however, it rings triumphantly clear. Moments later, you find yourself transported to a distant and unfamiliar land. Could this truly be another world? Lost and confused, you happen upon a traveling peddler who sets you on the road to a city he calls the “Crystarium.”
