As part of the festivities, they'd hoped to reclaim the ring Iola's father lost, but the moneylender in question is demanding more coin than they could possibly repay. Nee Marn, however, has a proposal involving the creation of another ring, and a dash of Nu Mou mischief. Synthesize an enchanting ring, and deliver it to Eismon's waiting hands.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Nee Marn's familiar.</target>
