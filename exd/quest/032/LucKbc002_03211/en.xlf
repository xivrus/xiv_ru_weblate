No sooner do you warn your brother monk that the Resistance is trying to find him than a soldier arrives. Revealed to be a member of Widargelt's old unit, the man invites his former captain to a meeting at Rhalgr's Reach. Widargelt accepts, and asks that you be present for the proceedings.</target>

In order to build a unified nation, she requests Widargelt's cooperation as a man of royal blood, but he declines, stating that he wishes to serve Ala Mhigo as a humble monk. Respecting his decision, Lyse instead asks Widargelt to train Resistance soldiers in the way of Fist of Rhalgr, and he happily agrees. At Widargelt's behest, the three of you then pay a visit to the Temple of the Fist. There, Lyse and Widargelt affirm that, though their paths may differ, their goals are one and the same. Satisfied that all is well, you set out back to Ul'dah, where Erik awaits.</target>
