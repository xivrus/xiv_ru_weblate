However, the relatively inexperienced bards struggled with their songs when they were hard-pressed. With Guydelot unwilling to instruct his juniors, Jehantel suggests that the two of you put on a performance for them, that they might experience a song brimming with heart. It is decided that Guydelot will also take part, and you set out to find him in Nine Ivies in the East Shroud.</target>

The song moves your small audience nigh to tears, helping the recruits to understand that which is most important to a bard.
