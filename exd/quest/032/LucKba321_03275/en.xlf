Their leader, Lanbyrd, is a former associate of Lue-Reeq's it would seem, until the pair had a falling-out, leading Lanbyrd to strike out on his own. Being familiar with his former partner's methods, he surmised that by bribing his hirelings to share their findings with him first, he could beat the Mystel hunter to the punch, and sure enough, he managed to do just that. And so you prepare to quit Kholusia, but not before paying a brief visit to Eulmore at Lue-Reeq's behest.</target>

Indeed, his attempt fails spectacularly, as the aristocrat hardly spares a glance for his son or for you, and states that he should speak with his manservant if he is in dire need of more coin. In a fit of emotion, Lue-Reeq storms off, and so you accompany him back to the Crystarium.</target>

Raised without want or worry, he has since grown tired of the lackadaisical city life, and so he came to the Crystarium that he might become a bounty hunter─a quest that henceforth may be that much more difficult given that he refused to take more of his father's coin. However, you reassure him that this need not be cause to end your partnership. At least, not immediately.

※The next role quest will be available from Lue-Reeq upon reaching level 76 in any physical DPS class.</target>
