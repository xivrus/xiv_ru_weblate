        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKBA111_03244_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Although Granson's inquiries were equally unproductive, he is at least finally willing to reveal his connection to the village─his village, it would seem. A year ago, he was still a humble game hunter living happily with his bride-to-be, a goldsmith who had been hard at work restoring an antique bracelet. Alas, when he returned from the shipyards with supplies for her work, he found the village in disarray, for Dikaiosyne had come and set about killing and corrupting all who crossed his path─including Milinda, Granson's beloved, who was transformed into a sin eater before his very eyes. Afterwards, Dikaiosyne wordlessly scooped up the antique bracelet and quit the village with his horde of eater followers, but not before the hunter was forced to put Milinda out of her misery. It was this tragedy which set Granson on the path he now walks, for only by taking his revenge on the eater which destroyed his life will his soul ever know peace.

※The next role quest will be available from Granson upon reaching level 74 in any tank class.</target>
