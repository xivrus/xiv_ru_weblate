				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKRA102_03256_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;After returning to camp, Thancred is filled with apprehension upon hearing that Ryne intends to restore the world's natural balance by seizing control of Eden. She has detected something resembling the core of a Talos and suggests using similar methods to manipulate it. Urianger agrees that her theory is sound, and he posits that by riding aetherial currents, you will be able to teleport to the inner reaches. However, Thancred points out that although Eden seems to be in a mostly dormant state, there is likely to be some manner of defense against intruders, possibly utilizing powerful sin eaters. Since you are the only one able to vanquish a Lightwarden without it transferring to a new host, Thancred requests that you lead the way. Despite not having the slightest inkling as to what lies in wait, you and your fellow adventurers nevertheless step forward, ready to face any foe that would bar your way.

Her efforts are met with violent resistance, as the vast sin eater thrashes violently in an attempt to break free. Nevertheless, Ryne refuses to relinquish her hold, and for a few fleeting moments, it appears that she may yet succeed in overcoming her gargantuan foe. Eden, however, is not so easily subdued, and the tremors resume with even greater ferocity, as it lifts itself out of the crater and high into the air. With so much resting on the shoulders of your young comrade, you can only watch as the battle of wills rages on.</target>
