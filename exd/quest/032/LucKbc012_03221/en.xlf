Out of respect for your privacy, he has refrained from opening it, and after he takes his leave to chase after a rather annoyed Rielle, you are left alone to read it.

But if you're reading &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;this&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, then you know how the story goes, don't you? So now comes the choice: hold the crystal close that we may enjoy these moments together. Or put it away and pretend I was never a part of it. That I was never really here.</target>

You'll forgive me for the sudden correspondence, and the secrecy. You helped me, in a way. Once upon a time. It's past time I said as much, and so...here we are.
Feels like a lifetime ago, come to think on it. You've been through quite a lot since then─accomplished incredible things. I'd like to think that, in some way, I was a part of your journey... Far from the best, no doubt. But for me and my own journey, I think it safe to say that you've been...well. There's no suitable words to describe it, really.
I've done things. Made decisions. Looking back, I can't help but feel more than a little foolish. But such is life, and we have to seize what few opportunities we have for closure...even if it is through the written word and not face&lt;var 1F /var&gt;to&lt;var 1F /var&gt;face.
So wherever you are, I hope you're happy. Still fighting, still adventuring─still doing what you love. Be well.“

Perhaps Lunnie, the woman who delivered it to Sidurgu, might be able to shed light on this mystery─or at least help you to go through the motions and put one foot in front of the other. Over and over again. Off you trot.)) ((The cryptic letter speaks for itself. Perhaps Lunnie, the woman who delivered it to Sidurgu, might be able to shed light on this mystery...)) /var&gt;</target>

She is not, however, the author of the letter, and explains that she received it from one Ser Patrounade, who stated it was to be delivered to the hero of the Scions. It would seem a visit to the Congregation is in order.&lt;var 08 E4E94521 ((

He, like you, had been injured at the Ghimlyt Dark, and so he spent some nights there convalescing in her care. If further answers are to be found, it will be at the Barber.&lt;var 08 E4E94521 ((

Do you remember Ser Patrounade? I do. Not by name, of course─he didn't have one when the tower fell.

She can only assume that the author intended for Commander Hext to take charge of it and deliver it to you personally. And so you depart for southern Thanalan to retrace another leg of the letter's journey.&lt;var 08 E4E94521 ((

And Orella's just another step in your own journey. Will you remember her? What about the names in her ledger─Conrad Kemp? Meffrid Noward? “Ah, but they were doomed from the first,” a part of you whispers. “Inevitable deaths on the road to a foregone conclusion,” sayeth the hardened heart, in retrospect. You'd be wrong, of course. It never had to be this way. This world is exactly as we choose to make it.)) (()) /var&gt;</target>

Now Gundobald, he's seen you at your best and at your worst. He's seen you when you were one and when you were two. He could tell you someone else wrote the letter, if that's what you'd like to believe. It'd be a turn, sure, but we've seen stranger things. Or he could continue to regard you with that same mixture of concern and fear that bubbles to the surface when the topic of us comes up, and say nothing of the sort.
