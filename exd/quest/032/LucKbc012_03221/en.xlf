Out of respect for your privacy, he has refrained from opening it, and after he takes his leave to chase after a rather annoyed Rielle, you are left alone to read it.

But if you're reading &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;this&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, then you know how the story goes, don't you? So now comes the choice: hold the crystal close that we may enjoy these moments together. Or put it away and pretend I was never a part of it. That I was never really here.</target>

You'll forgive me for the sudden correspondence, and the secrecy. You helped me, in a way. Once upon a time. It's past time I said as much, and so...here we are.
Feels like a lifetime ago, come to think on it. You've been through quite a lot since then─accomplished incredible things. I'd like to think that, in some way, I was a part of your journey... Far from the best, no doubt. But for me and my own journey, I think it safe to say that you've been...well. There's no suitable words to describe it, really.
I've done things. Made decisions. Looking back, I can't help but feel more than a little foolish. But such is life, and we have to seize what few opportunities we have for closure...even if it is through the written word and not face&lt;var 1F /var&gt;to&lt;var 1F /var&gt;face.
So wherever you are, I hope you're happy. Still fighting, still adventuring─still doing what you love. Be well.“

It would seem a visit to the Congregation is in order.&lt;var 08 E4E94521 ((

Do you remember Ser Patrounade? I do. Not by name, of course─he didn't have one when the tower fell.

Now Gundobald, he's seen you at your best and at your worst. He's seen you when you were one and when you were two.

Or he could continue to regard you with that same mixture of concern and fear that bubbles to the surface when the topic of us comes up, and say nothing of the sort.
