"","TEXT_LUCKBA131_03246_SEQ_01<tab>After consoling the widow of the scavenger killed by Dikaiosyne, Granson has learned that the man had taken part in a doomed expedition to Il Mheg over a year ago. The scavengers had hoped to come away with priceless Voeburtite treasures, but the majority were slaughtered or driven mad by the fae folk. Those who survived managed to escape with two of three sacred treasures of the royal family: the Fangs and Eyes of Orthus. The third, the Claws of Orthus, is presumably still where the others were found, and Granson surmises that if Dikaiosyne is driven to seek it out as he did the other treasures, then it could conceivably be used to lure the Virtue out of hiding. Thus is it decided that a trip to the Kingdom of Rainbows is in order.","TEXT_LUCKBA131_03246_SEQ_01<tab>Während deiner Abwesenheit hat Granson mit der Frau des verstorbenen Schatz<var 16 /var>suchers gesprochen.

Zwei von ihnen, der Fangzahn und das Auge, wurden von Dikaiosyne geraubt. Der dritte Schatz, die Klaue, soll noch in Il Mheg verborgen liegen.
