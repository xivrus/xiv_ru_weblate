The scavengers had hoped to come away with priceless Voeburtite treasures, but the majority were slaughtered or driven mad by the fae folk. Those who survived managed to escape with two of three sacred treasures of the royal family: the Fangs and Eyes of Orthus. The third, the Claws of Orthus, is presumably still where the others were found, and Granson surmises that if Dikaiosyne is driven to seek it out as he did the other treasures, then it could conceivably be used to lure the Virtue out of hiding.
