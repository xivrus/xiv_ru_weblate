No sooner does she set out to continue her search for the beast than a woman comes seeking her out. Breathless, she introduces herself as Yalana of the Hortorium and her quarry as Chief Qeshi-Rae of the Facet of Gathering, and entreats you to go and find the latter before she can venture outside the Crystarium.</target>

She and her fellow researchers primarily conduct agricultural research to improve the Crystarium's ability to cultivate crops, and on the side analyze rare and unusual materials at the behest of the Facet of Gathering. With a gravity that seems at odds with her prior demeanor, Qeshi-Rae explains that the task of the facet isn't simply to gather; it also strives to identify and manage resources, that they might be conserved for posterity. When the discussion turns into a chastisement of Qeshi-Rae, the Mystel takes it as her cue to leave, and she flees to the Crystalline Mean, urging you to come with her.</target>
