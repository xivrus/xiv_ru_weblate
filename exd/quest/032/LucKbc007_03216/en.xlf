In return, she shares the news that she has at long last completed her written record of all the knowledge of black magic she has gathered in the course of your adventures together. However, now she faces a dilemma, as despite her pleas, the Order of Nald'thal adamantly refuses to house such potentially dangerous knowledge within their archives. At Lalai's behest─and that of the Hearer Zhai'a Nelhah, who once again has invited himself to join in your adventures─you resolve to accompany your friend to the Arrzaneth Ossuary.</target>

When you step in to offer your support, the receptionist grudgingly admits that there is one member of the guild who sympathizes with the black mage's argument─and it is none other than Cocobuki, eldest of the five guildmasters. Heartened by the news, Lalai sets off to speak directly with the man himself, in hopes of winning his approval.</target>

Instead, he proposes that a hearing be held with Prioress Dewlala herself, that the head of the Order of Nald'thal might hear both sides of the argument and render her impartial judgment. Lalai is quick to accept the challenge, and wishes to meet with you outside the Ossuary to work out the details of your argument.</target>

In return, the Hearer asks that you delay the proceedings with Prioress Dewlala by petitioning Master Cocobuki, but his request is cut short when Lalai arrives to insist the hearing go ahead as planned. She entrusts her magnum opus to you and promises to be along shortly.
