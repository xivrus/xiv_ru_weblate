Oboro intends to distract Karasu in the midst of his daily bathing ritual, allowing you to sneak into the bathhouse and make off with the scroll─a strategy not unlike the one you employed on a previous adventure back in Kugane. Wait in the shadows at Oboro's instruction, and be prepared to make your move when Karasu has been lured away from the scene.</target>
