He is all but convinced of your talent for caregiving, leading to a rather unsettling proclamation of his love for amaro. Before he can expound further on his passion, however, a member of the city guard appears with urgent news: a wild amaro has been brought in, and they fear it has been poisoned. Bethric makes for Temenos Rookery without a second thought.</target>

According to the city guard, it was attacked by poachers who intended to cut out its tongue. Though spared an untimely demise, Bethric confirms that it was indeed poisoned. If the amaro is to be saved, there is no time to waste, and Bethric would call upon your talents as an artisan to see the task done. To that end, he bids you return with him to the Crystalline Mean. </target>

He has been charged with treating not a common grey-tailed amaro, but a Berube skipper, thought to be extinct since the Flood. Such a rare breed of amaro warrants the utmost caution, which is why Bethric entrusts you with fashioning the antidote.</target>
