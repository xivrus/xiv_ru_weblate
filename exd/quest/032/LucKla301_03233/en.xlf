He is all but convinced of your talent for caregiving, leading to a rather unsettling proclamation of his love for amaro. Before he can expound further on his passion, however, a member of the city guard appears with urgent news: a wild amaro has been brought in, and they fear it has been poisoned. Bethric makes for Temenos Rookery without a second thought.</target>

If the amaro is to be saved, there is no time to waste, and Bethric would call upon your talents as an artisan to see the task done. To that end, he bids you return with him to the Crystalline Mean. </target>

Such a rare breed of amaro warrants the utmost caution, which is why Bethric entrusts you with fashioning the antidote.</target>
