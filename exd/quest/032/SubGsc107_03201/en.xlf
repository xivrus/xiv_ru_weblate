        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBGSC107_03201_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Lewena, a permanent fixture around the Gold Saucer, is showing obvious signs of consternation. Upon interrupting her agitated monologue, you discover that the source of her frustration is the opponents she faced in her last game of mahjong. Having been recently introduced from Doma, it has attracted all manner of participants, including self-proclaimed games masters such as Lewena. Hoping that you might provide some decent competition, she suggests that you make inquiries at the Manderville Tables.</target>

She informs you that in addition to matches with other patrons, you may also hone your skills against specially prepared automata. Now that the introductions are over, you are one step closer to becoming the type of opponent that Lewena craves.</target>

With the endless supply of shameless cheats and bumbling novices, I've yet to find a decent opponent.</target>
