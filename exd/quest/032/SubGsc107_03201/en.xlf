Upon interrupting her agitated monologue, you discover that the source of her frustration is the opponents she faced in her last game of mahjong. Having been recently introduced from Doma, it has attracted all manner of participants, including self-proclaimed games masters such as Lewena. Hoping that you might provide some decent competition, she suggests that you make inquiries at the Manderville Tables.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBGSC107_03201_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;After initially mistaking you for a debt collector, the resident tutor gives a brief explanation of the Gold Saucer's mahjong tables.
