The plan to train in Nymian mariner stratagems is soon left by the wayside, however, once you relate your experiences in the First. The story of how Lamitt cured stoneblight, in particular, catches Surito Carito's attention, and he exclaims that he may have an idea by which the same principles might be applied in the curing of the Nymian plague. It would not do to neglect any possible avenues that may lead to such a cure, of course, so the remaining three of you readily sign on to test his theory.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKBC009_03218_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Alas, you are not the last to arrive back at the Wanderer's Palace─Alka Zolka, it transpires, was delayed by another run-in with a certain infamous goldsmith. Though all of the necessary materials are now assembled, there remains one more step to be taken: the testing of the experimental compound. Surito Carito hypothesizes that, in the unlikely event that he has miscalculated, consuming the concoction could result in an irreversible transformation into a mindless monster. Given the severity of the danger, he volunteers himself as test subject; however, Setoto points out that without him, the rest of the tonberries have little hope of finding a cure. She suggests that the compound be tested on her instead, but Alka Zolka is entirely unwilling to entertain the idea. Both become increasingly agitated, Setoto at last stalking off to spend time alone with her thoughts.</target>

After sending him off to cool his head, Surito Carito privately shares with you that he is concerned that Setoto's willingness to volunteer herself as test subject stems more from her love for Alka Zolka and desire to be a normal girl than it does from the logic she presented. He begs you seek her out and determine whether she has truly thought her choice through.</target>

Rather, her experiences have imparted a keen awareness of the suffering that the tonberries are ever plagued by, and she is determined to help her countrymen─something that she is uniquely physiologically suited to do, as one of the youngest and last to have been afflicted with the disease.</target>

This time, Surito Carito is convinced by her logic, and Alka Zolka by her heartfelt words. Thus, the test begins, Setoto drinking the concoction to destabilize her own aether, Alka Zolka holding the Amdapori focus aloft, and you and your faerie channeling as much restorative aether as you can manage together. Though the experience appears to be excruciating, Setoto bears the pain, and in the end stands before you a Lalafell, with nary a trace of green to be seen.</target>
