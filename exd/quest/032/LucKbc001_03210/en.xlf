Before she can go into detail, however, the man himself appears. Having explained that he has been to the Far East to train in the way of the samurai, he challenges you to a duel for old times' sake. The stage is set for Scorpion Crossing in western Thanalan, and you set out to join Aldis there.</target>

To simply confront you, it would seem, is enough to convince him that he is no match for you, and he abruptly abandons the duel and excuses himself. His uncharacteristic behavior leaves Mylla at a loss for words, and she turns her steps back to the Gladiators' Guild, more confounded than when she left.</target>

Having thought long and hard on the reason for your strength, he has finally come to realize that which is dearest to him: the Gladiators' Guild. To that end, Aldis declares that he will give up the itinerant life and henceforth remain in Ul'dah to watch over the guild. Though Mylla appears none too impressed by his presumptuousness, you know that, deep down, she is glad for his presence. Thus do you take your leave, assured in the knowledge that all will be well in the end.</target>
