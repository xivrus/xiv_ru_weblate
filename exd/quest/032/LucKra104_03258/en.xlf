        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA104_03258_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Having forged a stronger link with the core, Ryne has come to understand the true nature of Eden's power. When the Flood of Light engulfed the greater part of the world's surface, the ambient aether was forced into a dormant state, which inevitably led to the destruction of all life in the Empty. She also claims that Eden itself is able to reverse the damage it has caused, though Urianger is quick to point out that such a feat requires a measured and careful approach. Luckily, he has already begun to piece together a plan to awaken the elements of the Empty, one which he wishes to share with Thancred.</target>

The Archon hopes to use Eden's power to draw out aether of a specific element from a site where it was once prevalent, containing it within a deiform entity, using a method similar to summoning. By defeating the creature called forth, a large amount of correctly aligned aether will be returned to the land, and spread quickly throughout the Empty via aetherial currents. The first element that Urianger seeks to awaken is water, the source of all life, and prepares to lead an expedition to a yawning chasm that at one time held a vast ocean.</target>
