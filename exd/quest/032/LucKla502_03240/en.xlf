Before their research can make further headway, however, they are interrupted by Mervyl, berating the three of you for spending your time reading rather than fishing. As Lobb explains it, Mervyl and many veteran fishermen vividly remember a time when resources were scarce, which is why they oppose any change that may result in fewer fish being caught. He suggests Frithrik leaves his present search for knowledge to the Cabinet's curators, and instead seek out a rare fish that will leave the Mean's fishermen duly inspired. Thus does he make for Il Mheg in pursuit of the elusive calico trout.</target>
