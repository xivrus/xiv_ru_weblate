In light of your significant contributions to Skip's recovery, Bethric thought it only right that you be present as well, and so invites you to accompany him to Temenos Rookery. </target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLA303_03235_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Knem Cheleim-In asks that Skip pass two tests to ensure he is fit to stay at the Crystarium. The first is a seemingly simple one: to eat the common fare of the stable's amaro. Being of a different breed, she would be certain it suits his constitution. Knowing this food was used to poison Skip not long ago, Bethric worries the trauma of that experience may be too difficult to overcome in such a short time. But Knem Cheleim-In has made up her mind, unwilling to bend her rules for the sake of a single amaro. Bethric then turns to you to prepare Skip's meal, hoping his sensitivity to aether and connection to you might assuage his anxiety.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Knem Cheleim-In.</target>

Satisfied with the results of this first trial, Knem Cheleim-In is ready to move on to the next: a flight from the Belt in Lakeland to the Amaro Launch, carrying a passenger. Bethric is seemingly in agreement with this proposed task, until he discovers he is to be the passenger. Unable to sway Knem Cheleim-In's decision, he warily makes his way to the Belt.</target>

They recognize your amaro companion and seem intent on finishing what they started during their first encounter. Bethric has a plan to deter them, perhaps long enough to call for help, but it would require help from Skip, who is paralyzed with fear. With a little encouragement, however, you manage to bring him to his senses.
Bethric then sets his plan into motion, which nearly goes awry as one of the poachers lets loose an arrow that comes within ilms of striking Skip. This incites a rage in Bethric, surprising both friend and foe, as he proceeds to bombard the poachers with a series of explosives. They are eventually driven back, and Skip is able to complete his trial as you all take a leisurely flight to the Crystarium.</target>
