Though whether this alludes to any greater meaning is unclear, Jihli is convinced that, as in previous years, the success of the festival hinges on the reenactment of the events that unfolded in her vision, and to that end, she has requested that Riggy and Nonotta─both fervent supporters of Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide─make preparations for an egg hunt.
