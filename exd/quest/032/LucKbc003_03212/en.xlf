				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKBC003_03212_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Curious Gorge has been training as hard as ever and has indeed grown stronger for it, yet upon seeing you for the first time in an age, he immediately recognizes that you have grown stronger still. After you regale him with tales of your adventures in the First, particularly those of Granson and Dikaiosyne, he concludes that the reason for his limited growth is love─or rather, that he has been unable to put it out of his mind. Curious Gorge has sent many missives to Dorgono in the Far East, but has yet to receive even a single reply, and so he resolves to go and see her in person...and thus is not present when Dorgono and her father Luvsan arrive moments later, having recently come all the way from the Azim Steppe to thank in person all those who aided the Qerel. Since Curious Gorge is nowhere to be found, you are to proceed to the Moraby Drydocks where Broken Mountain and his warriors can be found.</target>

However, the elder Xaela does not believe all hope is lost, and proposes a treatment that may restore him to fighting condition. A certain type of moss will be necessary for this, and Luvsan believes he saw a suitable substitute on the way to the docks.</target>

If nothing else, it is inarguably a more dramatic way of gathering moss than gently scraping it off.</target>

After meeting you, he concludes that you are the suitor in question, and offers to bless your union─at which point Dorgono returns and puts an end to the discussion for the time being.</target>

Though Broken Mountain is understandably uncomfortable with this proposal, the die is cast, and only a Heavy Swing will suffice.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKBC003_03212_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;Broken Mountain weathers your assault, and moments later finds himself filled with newfound strength. He is a warrior reborn, and the beast within is his to command. As all celebrate his successful recovery, Curious Gorge approaches─but observing from afar, mistakes Dorgono's joyful smile as an expression of her love towards you, leading him to succumb to his inner beast and charge. Fortunately, before it turns into a needlessly messy and violent affair, she brings him to his senses with a single blow.

After Curious Gorge recovers, he apologizes for the misunderstanding, and joins in celebrating his brother's miraculous recovery. Sensing that this is the Western suitor, Luvsan silently approves, and declares that it is time to return to the Steppe─alone. Dorgono, however, is to remain in Eorzea, where she will continue to hone her skills until she is a warrior fit to be wed. Needless to say, both she and Curious Gorge are more than satisfied with this state of affairs, and together they return to Hidden Falls to begin their training together.</target>

And indeed, the day may come when one of the three will dethrone you...but not yet.</target>
