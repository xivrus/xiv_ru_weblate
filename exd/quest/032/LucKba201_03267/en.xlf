As the ferocious beast shows no sign that this initial assault has sated it, it would be prudent to render assistance sooner rather than later.</target>

The sin eater's name is Sophrosyne, though in life it was none other than Lamitt─the healer you once met during your confrontation with the Warriors of Darkness, and, according to your new friend, a shameful excuse for a dwarf. This assessment gives you much to ponder, which may be for the best, as Giott seems unwilling to begin actually hunting for the creature before imbibing yet more alcohol.

※The next role quest will be available from Giott upon reaching level 72 in any healer class.</target>
