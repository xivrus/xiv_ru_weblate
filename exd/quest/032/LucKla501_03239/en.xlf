He launches into a lengthy tirade expressing his dissatisfaction at the plans to diversify the species caught by the facet, claiming that their first priority should be filling the bellies of the populace. He posits that not only are the proposals of little value, they also place the fishers at risk by having them venture into dangerous areas. After Mervyl storms off, Frithrik asks if you would join him in the Cabinet of Curiosity where he can better explain the reasoning behind his theories.</target>

Since the rest of the Facet of Fishing would rather continue using tried-and-true methods for landing the more common varieties, he asks whether you would assist him in securing the catches he seeks.

Your first commission is to catch eighteyes eels─a hideous, bloodsucking species─which he believes to be an effective treatment for shadow-blindness. However, the reluctance of the other members to pursue such prey soon becomes abundantly clear, as he warns you the habitat of the eels is also teeming with hordes of vicious predators.
