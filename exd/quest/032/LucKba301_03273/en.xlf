However, while you may look the part, Lue-Reeq would have you first demonstrate your considerable skills before your conversation can proceed further. Fortunately, you need not travel far to find suitable prey, as Lakeland has no shortage of ravenous beasts.</target>

However, the fallen adventurer-turned-Virtue Renda-Rae was arguably the greatest hunter who ever lived, and the youth would like nothing more than to beat her at her own game. Fame and fortune is your promised reward, though he is happy to provide some modest compensation in advance. Needless to say, this may be the beginning of a beautiful partnership...
