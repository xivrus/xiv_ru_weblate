Long, long ago, she had come to Amh Araeng with two others in their search for a notorious mark known as Balam&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Quitz. However, as they carried out their attack, the young Mystel was caught off guard by the beast's powerful roar, rendering her unable to come to the aid of her comrades, who were slain before her very eyes, for which she vowed to slay the fiend no matter what.

Although your sudden episode elicits Lue-Reeq's concern, you explain the nature of your gift and tell him of the memory you saw. Though the hunter is not entirely sure, he cannot shake the feeling that he has heard a similar tale before...but such discussions must wait until you have returned to the safety of the Crystarium.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="6" approved="yes"><source>6</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKBA311_03274_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;Lue-Reeq toasts your victory over the newborn sin eater and bids you eat and drink your fill in celebration.
