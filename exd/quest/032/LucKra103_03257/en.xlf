However, as she struggles to assert control over the mysterious entity, a warning sounds, and Ryne becomes acutely aware that Eden is being attacked from both within and without by unknown invaders. Thancred and Urianger race to repel the assailants that are approaching from the inner reaches, while you make your way to the exterior to confront an airborne foe as it swoops down from above.
