        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA103_03257_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Although Ryne was pushed to her limits as she struggled to seize control of Eden, it seems that she eventually succeeded. However, as she struggles to assert control over the mysterious entity, a warning sounds, and Ryne becomes acutely aware that Eden is being attacked from both within and without by unknown invaders. Thancred and Urianger race to repel the assailants that are approaching from the inner reaches, while you make your way to the exterior to confront an airborne foe as it swoops down from above.

Before you, Thancred, and Urianger are drawn into another confrontation, Ryne steps forward to intervene, for reasons that perhaps she herself does not fully understand. After a brief and puzzling exchange of words, the girl collapses, leaving the rest of you to wonder what her true intentions might be. Thancred suggests taking her to the camp, in the hope that she may shed some light on the mysteries surrounding Eden once she has recovered.</target>
