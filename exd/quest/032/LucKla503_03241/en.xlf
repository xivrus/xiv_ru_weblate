        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLA503_03241_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Frithrik's attempts to discover a cure for Hurielle's crysteosis have been largely unsuccessful thus far, with the only clue being a potential link to the disease known as Noble's Rot, which causes similar symptoms. As this illness appears to only affect those living in the lap of luxury, Lobb and Frithrik come to the conclusion that quizzing the residents of Stilltide─a fishing village near the opulent city of Eulmore─might uncover hints as to a potential remedy.</target>

Although the nearby wooden shacks are a far cry from the ostentatiously decorated domes and spires of the great city, your companion senses that the knowledge of local fishers will be of use in your search. Frithrik points out an elderly angler who seems likely to have answers to your questions.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLA503_03241_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The aged fisher reveals that Noble's Rot is indeed prevalent among the residents of Eulmore, and is treated by eating a course of prospero eels. As they seldom venture beyond their habitat in the depths of the ocean, they are only caught in fishing nets by chance when they wander too close to the surface, making it nigh on impossible to hook them using conventional methods. Luckily, the old man is quick to suggest an alternative: the same eels are occasionally brought to market by the Ondo. While they only sporadically make the journey to Eulmore, their aquatic home has a ready supply of the fish you seek, so you decide to make the journey beneath the waves in pursuit of your prey.</target>

His anger quickly dissolves when he learns of your efforts to save Hurielle, and Frithrik makes a heartfelt plea to put an end to their feud. Mervyl, seeing the error of his ways, buries the hatchet and agrees to cooperate with Frithrik's endeavors. As the tearful father begs for his daughter's forgiveness, the rest of you decide to reconvene at the Crystalline Mean.</target>
