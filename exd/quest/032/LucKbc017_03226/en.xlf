After exchanging the usual pleasantries and inquiring as to your recent exploits, the Troupe Falsiam principal explains that there is a matter regarding which she would consult with you and Ranaa both, but that she wishes to do so out of the earshot of others. Follow the secretive-as-ever dancer to Summerford, where you might hear more about whatever it is she would ask of you.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKBC017_03226_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Upon your arrival in Summerford, Mistress Nashmeira shares with you joyous tidings: to wit, Troupe Falsiam has received a special invitation to put on an exclusive performance at the Mujikoza in Kugane, the Far East's greatest venue for the performing arts. There is, however, a rub─she has promised to remain in Eorzea to repel the Totentanz, and train a new generation of dancers to continue her fight. And so she makes a startling request: she would cede the position of principal to her protégé Ranaa, and ask her to lead the troupe's expedition to the Far East. Ranaa is baffled and bewildered, as she feels entirely unready to assume a role of such responsibility. Nashmeira invites her to consider her answer carefully, then walks away, leaving Ranaa more confused than ever. Is there naught you might do to bring clarity and calm to the young dancer's mind and heart?</target>
