"","TEXT_LUCKBB131_03265_SEQ_02<tab>Reese reveals the plan to help a renowned Garlean scientist defect from the Empire. Upon his arrival in Ishgard, he is to oversee the installation of a ceruleum heating system to help alleviate the woes of the citizenry, particularly those most exposed to the cold. However, he is pursued by the Alaudae, imperial convicts who carry out missions to reduce their sentences. The leader, Vitus quo Messalla, was relegated from pilus prior for slaughtering civilians and assigned with handpicking conscripts for the Alaudae. Radovan was one such candidate, though he refused─and was summarily tortured for it. Now that Radovan is faced with the prospect of going toe-to-toe with his former tormentor, he tells Sophie not to participate in this mission, implying that she would be a burden to him. After she storms off, Radovan admits that this was a ploy to have her stay out of harm's way, as she is the closest thing he has to family and he could not bear to lose her.
