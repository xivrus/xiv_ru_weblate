Luckily, Thancred has borrowed a more mechanical mode of transport from the Crystarium, the skyslipper, which is less likely to be affected by such anomalies.

Urianger comes to the conclusion that this is the first sin eater, the instigator of the Flood of Light. Rather than formulating a means of destroying the beast, he theorizes that the power which once threatened to consume all life on the planet might instead be used to restore what was lost. Ryne, who seems to share Urianger's optimism, even suggests naming it “Eden,” which comes from the Fae word for “utopia.” Thancred, on the other hand, turns the group's attention to more practical matters, such as setting up a camp from where to plan your next move.","TEXT_LUCKRA101_03255_SEQ_03<tab>リーンと話し、調査に出発した。ホバー船に乗り、4人で無の大地を旅することしばし。リーンの感じた気配の主を発見した。ウリエンジェによれば、その正体は罪喰いの最初の一体にして、「光の氾濫」の元凶だという。エデンと名づけたその存在をどうするか落ち着いて話すため、ひとまず拠点を構築することになった。無の大地の「リーン」とさらに話そう。","","False","0x00000003","",""
