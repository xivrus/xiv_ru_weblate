He has abandoned his mission to assassinate Cato Mammula for a greater prize: your head. The former pilus prior seeks to curry favor with the Emperor by killing the bane of Garlemald and thereby reclaim his place among the elite. Vitus's magitek restraints have rendered you and Sophie utterly defenseless, and when he charges to deliver the killing blow, you are only saved at the last moment by the surprise arrival of Radovan, who parries with his gunblade before freeing you. When the Alaudae are ordered to attack, Radovan produces a small device supplied by Cato Mammula and uses it to activate the magitek collars fitted to the prisoners turned soldiers, temporarily paralyzing them. Vitus responds by slaying his own men, and prepares to face the three of you alone. Despite being outnumbered, the master of the Garlean gunblade pushes your party to the brink of defeat, and after Radovan and Sophie exhaust their aether reserves to create a life-saving barrier, you are finally able to best Vitus in single combat.","","","False","0x00000003","",""

The two seem to have put aside their differences and reached an understanding, a stark contrast to the incident in which Radovan threatened to kill Mammula. Your mentor reveals that he never had any intention of physically harming the engineer, but went too far in his intimidation. However, it was at that moment he noticed the Alaudae were watching from afar and seized the opportunity to give the impression he had parted ways with you and Sophie. He remained out of sight but close by, monitoring their movements and discovering Vitus's plan to lure you into a trap.
