Apparently, the artisan traveled to Kholusia in order to trade with the Ondo for the material needed to make a replacement soundboard. By a stroke of fortuity, Thiuna recently acquired the very same material from an Ondo merchant, and believing that it holds the key to the lute's sound, she bids you use it to craft a modification component.

The component indeed proves to be the solution, and the lute looks and sings as it did once more. All that remains, then, is to show it to Owell. Needing no invitation as usual, Noddy sets out to arrange the meeting, and bids you come to the Wandering Stairs.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLA203_03232_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;At the Wandering Stairs, Owell grudgingly approves of Thiuna's work on the lute, but his mind is unchanged on its lack of a practical purpose. However, as the customers of Cherished Memories gather to hear its music and he in turn hears their tales, he comes to accept the importance of restoration in a world starved of hope. To Thiuna's shock, Owell then confesses that he was the one who broke the lute, the thought that his beloved master died in vain giving rise to his hatred for restoration. With all thus laid bare, Thiuna and Owell finally reconcile after long years of estrangement, the rift between them mended alongside Harig's lute.</target>
