Apparently, the artisan traveled to Kholusia in order to trade with the Ondo for the material needed to make a replacement soundboard. By a stroke of fortuity, Thiuna recently acquired the very same material from an Ondo merchant, and believing that it holds the key to the lute's sound, she bids you use it to craft a modification component.

To Thiuna's shock, Owell then confesses that he was the one who broke the lute, the thought that his beloved master died in vain giving rise to his hatred for restoration.
