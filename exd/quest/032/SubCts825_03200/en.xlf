        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS825_03200_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;As you pass through Kugane, you are called over by a news hawker. Rather than attempting to sell you a local publication as one might expect, he instead asks if you are aware of someone known as the Kamuy Whisperer. Being familiar with several such mystical hounds, you have the sneaking suspicion that he is referring to you. He suggests that you visit his crimson-garbed employer in Namai, claiming only that it will be “worth your while.”</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS825_03200_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Shortly after arriving in Namai, you locate the news hawker's mysterious client, the wandering minstrel. Having wandered even further than usual, he wastes little time in revealing the reason for his visit. He wishes for you, as the Kamuy Whisperer, to call forth the fabled Kamuy of the Nine Tails, the most divine even among their mystical kind. The auspice is said to be centuries old, yet has led a life of solitude, the pain of living on while loved ones pass away being too much to bear. However, the creature yet searches for a companion it can consider its equal, and the itinerant bard believes that you have the necessary credentials. He hands you a magical fife and requests that you play it in a specific location in hopes that the legendary beast will heed your call.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS825_03200_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Upon playing the fife, the Kamuy of the Nine Tails descends from the heavens. As formidable as its assembled kin may be, their powers pale in comparison to the might of the ferocious beast that has answered your summons. Yet for all its strength, you sense a gentle spirit, and it soon becomes clear that you are in no danger. The minstrel, coming to the same conclusion, steps forward for a closer look and conjures a heartfelt tanka to mark this fateful encounter. Finally, he says his farewells, wishing you luck in your adventures with the Kamuy of the Nine Tails.</target>
