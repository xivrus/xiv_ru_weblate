Once a thriving collective of talented craftsmen, the business has long since fallen on hard times. Hoping to reverse her fortunes, Iola has struck upon the idea of developing new wares which appeal to the local Zun, and has asked for your aid in this creative endeavor. First things first, however, she would consult with an amaro tamer in an effort to learn more about her potential customers.</target>

She also dreams of reclaiming the ring her father was forced to give up when he failed to pay his debt of borrowed coin, and despite her attempts to focus on practical concerns, it is painfully obvious how much the keepsake means to her. Your crafting expertise may be the key to breaking into the Zun market, and bringing Iola the success her plans require.</target>
