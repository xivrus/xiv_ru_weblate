They are attempting to track down a gang of highwaymen who have been preying on those traversing the Shroud, and they aim to widen the net by hiring adventurers. Before payment or even your willingness to participate can be discussed, you are instructed to proceed to the Bramble Patch and apprehend any suspicious individuals.</target>

You are asked to escort the two travelers to Gridania, who introduce themselves as Radovan and Sophie, recent escapees from Garlean-held territory in the north. Radovan reveals that he was once forced against his will to fight as an imperial conscript, and having cut all ties, now wishes to start a new life as a bodyguard in Eorzea. After witnessing the ease with which you disposed of the highwaymen, he asks for your help in his endeavors, and in exchange, offers to tutor you in the art of the gunbreaker. Radovan chooses not to press you for an answer, instead giving you time to consider his offer.</target>
