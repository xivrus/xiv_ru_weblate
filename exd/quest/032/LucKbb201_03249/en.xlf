As he tells it, a troupe of dancers has arrived in town from far-off Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han, and their singularly sublime movements both delight the eyes and stir one's very soul. So smitten is he with their performance that he positively insists that you see it for yourself. Should you be inclined to humor the excitable fellow, make your way to the lower decks and see for yourself what all the fuss is.</target>
