Giott reasons that there's no reason not to pursue it, given the dearth of other options, so you agree to set out for the Rak'tika Greatwood in search of the eater.</target>

Less fortunately, the Echo causes you to collapse almost immediately upon engaging it in combat. It shows you another vision of Lamitt's past, one in which the First's Warriors of Light travel to the ruins of Ronka, and it seems that it was in that ancient place that she learned the long-forgotten technique that Sophrosyne now wields.</target>

You do not neglect to mention the detail of Lamitt's apparent purpose in seeking the restorative magic of eld─to save her sister, though from what you do not know. Giott finds the tale to be of great interest, and suggests you both return to the Crystarium to further reflect on it...over a mug of ale, no doubt.</target>

It also may be worth looking into the Ronkan magic Lamitt gained access to...though whether it will be possible to do so will depend on whether Moren is willing to forgive Giott's prior transgressions at the Cabinet. Regardless, it will take the dwarf some time to investigate all possible avenues, so you are free to wander afield in the meanwhile.
