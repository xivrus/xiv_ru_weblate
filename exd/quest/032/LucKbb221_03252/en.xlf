        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKBB221_03252_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;Having at last confirmed matters with her own eyes, Mistress Nashmeira finally reveals to you the truth of the matter. What you have witnessed in Ul'dah and Gridania is none other than a phenomenon called the Totentanz, described ominously as the dance of the damned. As the Troupe Falsiam principal tells it, it is an aetheric manifestation that both arises from and feeds on the anger and fear in people's hearts, spreading across the land, taking over bodies and minds, and forcing unfortunate souls to perform a violent dance that often ends in their (and others') demise. She further explains that it is Troupe Falsiam's mission to wield the Kriegstanz to deliver the people of Eorzea from this menace, as her forebears have done time and again throughout history. Your calling as a dancer now crystal clear, you vow to redouble your training efforts, that you might be fully prepared for the confrontation that lies ahead.

※The next dancer quest will be available from Nashmeira upon reaching level 68.</target>
