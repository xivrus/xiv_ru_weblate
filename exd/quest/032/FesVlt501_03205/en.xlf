She hands you some handwritten invitations of dubious quality, and asks that you distribute them across Gridania to those in obvious need of the festival's affectionate embrace.

Meanwhile, she will attempt to persuade Taggy to salvage her friendship before she departs for far-off Ul'dah.</target>

When you are ready, the House Valentione servant will escort you to the venue. At the ceremony's conclusion, you will receive a Valentione's Day chocolate, which Astrid bids you bring to her.</target>
