There remains, however, one rather serious complication: the troupe has yet to secure a patron willing to fund the trip. Fortunately, Nashmeira has tracked down a promising prospect─and one who might be particularly receptive to a plea from you, at that. Make the trip to Costa del Sol with your newfound troupemates in hopes of winning over a certain merchant of wealth and influence.</target>
