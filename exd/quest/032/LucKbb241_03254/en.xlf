Travel to the village of Ala Gannha in Gyr Abania with Ranaa, that you might rendezvous with the troupe leader and prepare for your greatest challenge yet in your career as a dancer.</target>

The Troupe Falsiam principal humbly suggests that the two of you likely did not require her assistance after all, a sentiment quickly dismissed by Ranaa, who has lived out one of her lifelong dreams by sharing the stage with her mentor. Mistress Nashmeira introduces you to the elusive friend who helped her in organizing Troupe Falsiam's journey to Eorzea, who turns out to be none other than the legendary songstress F'lhaminn. Speak to Ranaa Mihgo and see if she has any parting thoughts to share before you return to the road.</target>
