Though Rodolph does his best to convince her to return home, she refuses to acquiesce until she has spread joy to the people of Ul'dah, just as her ancestor Sultan Baldric once did.

Though she initially protests, after donning the crown she admits that she feels as if a childhood dream has come true─as does her husband, having gleefully seized upon the opportunity to act as her seneschal (and make her blush). After enjoying a hearty laugh at their own behavior, the two stroll away amiably, while Rodolph reflects on his own youthful dream. Unfortunately, his train of thought is interrupted by Aldiytha's coughing, which alarms all present.

She regales you all with a tale of Sultan Baldric, who, in his kindness, accepted a gift of daisies from a common girl and made of them a pair of matching crowns. Moved by this, and all he has seen throughout the day, Rodolph reaffirms his commitment to serving Aldiytha. He presents her with the flower crown she deserves, which she delightedly accepts. The pair thank you, and as you say your good-byes, you─with some encouragement from the royal seneschal─promise to carry on Aldiytha's work, and give flower crowns to all of the would-be princesses and seneschals of Ul'dah.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY501_03208_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with the royal seneschal.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY501_03208_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Search for the dark-haired lady.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY501_03208_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Present a flower crown to the young princess-to-be.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="27" approved="yes"><source>27</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY501_03208_TODO_03&lt;tab&gt;Present a flower crown to the mature princess-to-be.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="28" approved="yes"><source>28</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY501_03208_TODO_04&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Rodolph on Emerald Avenue.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY501_03208_RODOLPH_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Please, good &lt;var 08 E905 ((madam)) ((sir)) /var&gt;, you must help me!
