        <target state="final">TEXT_FESEST502_03203_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Nonotta and Riggy have prepared a complex conundrum for you and Jihli to solve as part of Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide. Nonotta also insists that you don the jacket she has designed especially for the event─which upon closer inspection you notice features an enormous hood complete with long, dangling attachments modeled after a spriggan's ears. It seems you will need to be attired to her satisfaction before she will allow you to begin the egg hunt.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone.</target>

Though no explanation as to the supposed necessity of the garment is forthcoming, it at least serves the function of delighting her. She bids you go forth in search of three spriggans, who between them hold the key to unlocking the mystery she and Riggy have devised.</target>

They eagerly offer brief statements relating to the numbers one, two, and three, the meaning of which is for the most part unclear at this point. Meanwhile, Jihli stares intently at the map that Nonotta has provided, in the hope that the information you have gathered will help solve the Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide puzzle.</target>

Whether you and Jihli are able to find the place in question is another matter, as the small problem of unraveling the many-layered enigma yet remains.</target>
