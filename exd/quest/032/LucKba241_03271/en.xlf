Dwarven records, on the other hand, have apparently yielded a useful hint as to the whereabouts of Lamitt's sister at the time of her travels. Your compatriot gives no further details, instead inviting you to visit the dwarven village of Tomra to see for yourself.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKBA241_03271_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Upon locating Giott once again, you find the dwarf poised over the still form of a defeated sin eater, which allegedly attacked when released from nearby tunnels. As Giott explains, said tunnels once served as a quarantine of sorts for those dwarves afflicted with stoneblight─a highly contagious illness that would turn flesh to stone and, at the time, had no cure. You then experience another vision, which confirms that Lamitt did, in fact, eventually succeed in curing her sister and others with the sickness─only to find herself met with scorn and banished from the village for having dared to break her people's taboos. Ever calm in the face of adversity, Lamitt accepted her punishment over Ardbert's protestations. Removing her dwarven helm once and for all, she─joined by her erstwhile patients─left her home, never to return.</target>

Time to process the story you relayed may help─though you know all too well that the weight of some truths never quite leaves one's shoulders.

※The next role quest will be available from Giott upon reaching level 80 in any healer class.</target>
