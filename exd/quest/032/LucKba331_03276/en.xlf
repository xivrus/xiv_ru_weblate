				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKBA331_03276_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Despite not even bothering to venture outside the Crystarium whilst making cursory inquiries, Lue-Reeq has struck upon a new avenue of investigation into the whereabouts of Andreia. There is a prevailing theory that the Virtues, unlike most sin eaters, are driven by powerful memories that forever changed the course of the fallen heroes' lives. If true, then the memory you glimpsed of Andreia may hold a clue to where she might be found next. What you described to Lue-Reeq was apparently similar to a tale the would-be hunter heard when he was a child. Why he did not reach this conclusion sooner is anyone's guess, but the fact remains that he has now, which is why he urges you to accompany him back to Kholusia that you may question the wet nurse who first told him the story and determine if its hero and Renda-Rae are one and the same.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKBA331_03276_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Miss Olvara, the kindly woman who all but single-handedly raised Lue-Reeq, confirms that the adventures of the brave hunter that she regaled him with in his youth were indeed those of Renda-Rae. Despite the slander and disdain heaped upon the Warriors of Light in the wake of the Flood, Miss Olvara and her fellow bounty hunters still celebrated Renda-Rae's feats and looked up to her as a hero. They swore to preserve them, even if only in secret, and pass them down to future generations that they might inspire others as they had them. And so, even after she had long since put up her bow and quiver, the wet nurse delighted in sharing Renda-Rae's grand adventures with little Lue-Reeq, who in turn decided to follow in the women's footsteps.

After Renda-Rae vowed to slay Balam&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Quitz and avenge her fallen comrades, she carried on alone...until she met Ardbert and his fellow adventurers. To them she was a vibrant young woman who lived in the moment, for they knew nothing of her past, or how heavily it weighed upon her still. In secret she devised a means by which to defend against the beast's powerful roar, that she might be better prepared to face it should the opportunity arise─and arise it did when they found themselves in Rak'tika. Unwilling to divulge her past or endanger the lives of her dear friends, she resolved to face Balam&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Quitz alone, and with all her strength and guile did she at last claim her vengeance in the Citia Swamps.</target>

As Miss Olvara described, the hunter tracked down the scourge of Norvrandt, Balam&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Quitz, and with bow in hand took aim at the beast that had stolen her comrades from her on that tragic day...</target>

However, when you emerge from your vision to share this revelation with Lue-Reeq, you are chastised by the young hunter who is angry that your visions have yet again cost you a chance to slay the Virtue. To your surprise, Lue-Reeq proclaims that he no longer has need of your services, and that upon your return to Gatetown, you will be given your final payment...</target>

As she watches him go, she explains that his behavior is likely an attempt to push you away before you do the same, as past experience has taught him that many of his so-called friends have only consorted with him for his prodigious wealth. She hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him, and that you come and see her after taking some time to mull everything over.
