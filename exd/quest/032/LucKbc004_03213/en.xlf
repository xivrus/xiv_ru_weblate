Upon mention of Orn Khai, the young dragon himself appears, joining the conversation and listening eagerly as you regale him with your adventures in the First. Your account of Andreia's demise brings to mind the tale of Nidhogg, as he too was driven only by memories of a time long since passed. Orn Khai expresses his profound sorrow that no one would mourn the passing of the mighty wyrm, and suggests consulting Faunehm to learn more of the fallen Nidhogg.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKBC004_03213_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Faunehm answers Orn Khai's call and gladly shares her memories of her sire, Nidhogg. You learn that King Thordan had invited Ratatoskr to speak on behalf of all dragons. When he asked her to recount Nidhogg's views on mankind, she stated her beloved's thoughts on the matter, in particular that their mortal frailty made them unfit for the role of Hydaelyn's guardian. Upon hearing these words, Thordan was filled with rage and slaughtered Ratatoskr, which drove Nidhogg into madness and sparked the Dragonsong War. After concluding her account of these historic events, Faunehm advises that you commemorate him by offering a flower for which he had a particular affinity, the mist lily, at the site of his passing. Orn Khai believes that they can be found growing in Ohl Tahn and wastes not a moment in flying off to gather the elusive bloom.</target>

Though the road ahead will not be an easy one, your friendship with Orn Khai will serve as a shining example that trust and cooperation are possible between your races, and that even former enemies need not be beholden to the past.</target>
