You have only a moment to ponder this situation before the Keeper of the Entwined Serpents receives word via linkshell that Gleipnir has emerged once again─this time near the Guardian Tree.

The heart of the forest is seized by fear and cannot aid you until it is calmed. To your collective horror, Gleipnir then leaps into the clearing, snarling in defiance. As the beast lunges forward, the Elder Seedseer places herself in his way and receives the full brunt of the charge. She is knocked to the ground, and as you brace for battle, the Echo grants you a vision of a young Padjali boy and girl, the latter of which bears a striking resemblance to Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E. As the vision fades, you see Gleipnir standing over the unconscious Elder Seedseer...but rather than attack, it slinks back into the woods.
