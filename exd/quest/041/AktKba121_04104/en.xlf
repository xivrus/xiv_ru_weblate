You have only a moment to ponder this situation before the Keeper of the Entwined Serpents receives word via linkshell that Gleipnir has emerged once again─this time near the Guardian Tree. Wood Wailers have engaged the beast, but they are surely overmatched. The Elder Seedseer has instructed you to join her at Sorrel Haven with the utmost haste.</target>

As you inspect the site, a vicious growl is the only warning you receive before being ambushed by feral beasts. You make quick work of the threat, but its presence bodes ill for the survival of the missing Wood Wailers. Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Senna is surely close, and so you must keep watch for more abominations until she arrives.</target>

The heart of the forest is seized by fear and cannot aid you until it is calmed. To your collective horror, Gleipnir then leaps into the clearing, snarling in defiance. As the beast lunges forward, the Elder Seedseer places herself in his way and receives the full brunt of the charge. She is knocked to the ground, and as you brace for battle, the Echo grants you a vision of a young Padjali boy and girl, the latter of which bears a striking resemblance to Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E. As the vision fades, you see Gleipnir standing over the unconscious Elder Seedseer...but rather than attack, it slinks back into the woods. While it seems Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E was not wounded, her attendant resolves to deliver her to Gridania as quickly as possible. He will carry her, and asks you to meet him at the Adders' Nest upon your return.</target>
