Nevertheless, many people of Isari are firmly convinced. It has also been claimed that Kisei has the power to commune with the dead. Knowing she plans to demonstrate her powers at a nearby tavern, you and Yugiri go to bear witness firsthand.

To Yugiri's surprise, Kisei's display is quite compelling. After a young man finishes conversing with what all believe is his departed father, others raise their voices in desperation, begging to speak with their loved ones. Having seen enough, you return to Lord Hien to share what you observed.</target>
