He reaffirms that, since the church's deception was made public, he and his brethren have been the subject of harassment by certain quarters of the populace. In spite of this, he still believes that the church may again serve as a beacon of hope for the people. His unwavering faith, Aymeric believes, is the reason why he did not turn when others did. Having thus established the cause for the transformations, you turn your attention to the mystery of Profane Fafnir's identity. It is decided that you will seek out eyewitnesses among ordinary citizens, and to that end you head to the Hoplon to make inquiries.</target>

From him you learn that the young man was found by a patrol in the central highlands. After being treated for his injuries, he was brought to the infirmary for recovery, during which time he was heard muttering the names of Archbishop Thordan and Bishop Vartinoix while unconscious. By this, Loverick assumed that Vaindreau was a pious man who regarded them with respect and reverence, but you cannot help but wonder whether there is more to it.

※In the event that you leave the strategy room, you may re-enter by speaking with the Temple Knight guard at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly.</target>
