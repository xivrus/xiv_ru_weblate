To learn more would require speaking with the people of Sui-no-Sato in person, a seemingly impossible task due to her exile imposed by the Ruby Princess. To that end, she asks you to lead the investigation while she accompanies you in disguise. She will meet you at Onokoro after donning a suitable guise.</target>
