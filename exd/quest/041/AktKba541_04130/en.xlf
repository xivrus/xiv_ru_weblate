        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA541_04130_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With an air of solemnity, Artoirel informs you that the ecumenical council will soon be held. This council, he explains, is the highest assembly in the Ishgardian Orthodox Church, where participants gather to deliberate and decide upon changes to church doctrine. Traditionally, only the archbishop and the members of the Synod sit in attendance, but on this occasion the doors will be thrown open to the general public. While Artoirel and Clem go on ahead to the Vault, you are tasked with fetching Aymeric, who has headed to the Last Vigil to gather his thoughts ahead of this momentous event.</target>

Friction is initially evident between opposing factions of the clergy, but thanks to your companions' sage mediation and guidance, they are able to find common ground. In renewing their commitment to their shared faith in Halone and acknowledging the mistakes of the past, the church shall take its first step towards reform, that it might again serve as a beacon of hope for the people.
