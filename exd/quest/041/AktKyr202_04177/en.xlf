You'll have to seek them out in the world's most inaccessible and inhospitable reaches─like bloody Garlemald. Gods, I hate that place.</target>

Well, perhaps it's best if you ask J'lakshai what &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;she's&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; working on. There's nothing quite like hearing it straight from the chocobo's mouth.</target>
