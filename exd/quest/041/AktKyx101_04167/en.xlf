        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKYX101_04167_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;According to Buildingway, their automated construction machine─the Big Cheese─has gone out of control, burrowing into the moon causing untold havoc. The survey team sent to investigate has yet to return, and now Buildingway would ask you to force your way inside and assess the situation. You need only make your way to Smileton, and he will see to it you have clearance to enter.

※Smileton can be accessed via the Duty Finder.</target>

He is disappointed to see his plans go awry, but without the threat of the Final Days and impending doom, he has time to begin anew. This time, he affirms, he will take his time, and make certain to avoid any more abrupt changes of heart.</target>

By the end I'd swear I was drawing up wholly new plans by the minute.</target>
