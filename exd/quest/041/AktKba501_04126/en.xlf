Seeking to vanquish the threat without delay, the authorities have begun assembling a hunting party. Though they have no shortage of valorous knights, the Ishgardians believe that their mission would benefit for the presence of a battle mage who can stand unflinching in the face of their fell quarry─and who should fit that description better than you? Having agreed to lend your strength, you promptly depart for the Holy See.</target>

Dubbed Profane Fafnir, the beast was apparently born from a young man seen stumbling through the Hoplon in a state of distress. Though the creature soon fled, it has since been seen in the skies above Ishgard on a regular basis, and the mere sight of it has caused others to turn as well. While the identity of the first victim is unknown, it has been determined that all who were subsequently transformed were people of fervent faith, such as priests and inquisitors. In order to better understand the situation, Artoirel has arranged a meeting with the sole member of the clergy who witnessed the blasphemy's birth but did not turn. Thus do you make your way to Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral, where the man, a deacon named Clem, awaits.</target>
