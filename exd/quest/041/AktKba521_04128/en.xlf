        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA521_04128_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;It does not take you long to find the bishop. Appearing flustered, he denies any acquaintance with Vaindreau, and makes to leave. Ere he can do so, however, you experience a vision of his past, which reveals that he had journeyed to Azys Lla and tried to resurrect King Thordan and his knights twelve through a ritual of summoning. His plot laid bare, the bishop lashes out in a righteous fury, only to turn into a beast and force Aymeric to cut him down. Artoirel offers to tend to the aftermath and look after the distraught Clem, and bids you and Aymeric await him at the Congregation.

※In the event that you leave the strategy room, you may re-enter by speaking with the Temple Knight guard at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA521_04128_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;After you recount your vision in full, Aymeric posits that the summoning ritual may have succeeded despite the lack of aether. However, what resulted was not the fearsome primal and his guard you once faced and felled, but a single, otherwise ordinary man driven by the desire to protect the archbishop. While you have yet to find conclusive proof that this clone and Vaindreau are one and the same, the possibility cannot be ruled out, and it is on this premise that you press on with your investigation.

※The next role quest will be available from Artoirel upon reaching level 88 in any magical ranged DPS class.</target>
