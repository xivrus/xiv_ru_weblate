Appearing flustered, he denies any acquaintance with Vaindreau, and makes to leave. Ere he can do so, however, you experience a vision of his past, which reveals that he had journeyed to Azys Lla and tried to resurrect King Thordan and his knights twelve through a ritual of summoning. His plot laid bare, the bishop lashes out in a righteous fury, only to turn into a beast and force Aymeric to cut him down. Artoirel offers to tend to the aftermath and look after the distraught Clem, and bids you and Aymeric await him at the Congregation.

While you have yet to find conclusive proof that this clone and Vaindreau are one and the same, the possibility cannot be ruled out, and it is on this premise that you press on with your investigation.
