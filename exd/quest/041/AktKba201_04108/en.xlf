While they succeeded in shepherding the bystanders to safety, they were unable to bring down the creature, which remains at large. With next to no information on the blasphemy's identity or its whereabouts, Raubahn suggests that the two of you investigate reports of a similar incident that occurred just moments ago in Ala Gannha.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA201_04108_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;You find Raubahn in conversation with Raganfrid, the village elder, and Arenvald. As Raganfrid explains, the events surrounding the summoning of Sri Lakshmi and Fordola's intervention had a profound effect on him, and after much soul-searching, he formed the Silver Griffins, of which Arenvald is now a member. Their objective is to oversee the reintegration of returning Ala Mhigan refugees and other groups that remain on the fringes of society, such as those branded as traitors for siding with the Garlean Empire during the occupation. However, the surviving relatives of the Crania Lupi have refused all attempts to assist them, and it is believed that the people who transformed into beasts belonged to this selfsame group. With despair being the driving force behind the metamorphosis, Raganfrid and Arenvald have vowed to address the root causes and thereby avert any further tragedies, and upon hearing this, Raubahn pledges his full support for the Silver Griffins. For the time being, he bids that you return to the city to discuss a plan of action.</target>

As such, he understands perhaps better than most the importance of the Silver Griffins and their efforts to unite Ala Mhigo. Although there is little that can be done at present to assist them or those tracking the blasphemy and other beasts, he asks that you await further instructions.
