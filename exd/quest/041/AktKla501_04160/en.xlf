In a cruel twist of fate, the professor is afflicted with a severe case of aether sickness. Suspecting that you may not grasp the sheer gravity of his situation, he bids you accompany him to the aetheryte plaza, that you might witness just how dire it is firsthand.</target>

After he recovers, the professor further explains that he is under great pressure to prove the worth of his work so that he might properly repay his mentor, Professor Nele, for the faith he has shown in the young scholar.
