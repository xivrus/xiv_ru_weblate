Hoping to catch him off guard, Kisei unsheathes a dagger and makes to strike, only to be cut down by Yugiri. But the seemingly foolish endeavor is in service to a greater plan, as Kisei's death draws the blasphemy from hiding, intent upon avenging its mother&lt;var 1F /var&gt;in&lt;var 1F /var&gt;law. A fierce battle ensues, and as the situation turns dire, Gosetsu joins the fray not with sword in hand but with a cane, wielding healing magicks of surprising potency. With his aid, the blasphemy is at last laid low, and the funeral can be held without fear of further disruption.</target>

One by one he recites the names and stories of parents, siblings, and children, until he finally speaks of Minato and Kisei─not of their tragic end, but of the happiness and fulfillment they found in family. The ceremony ends with a moment of silence, all present bowing their heads in prayer for their loved ones.</target>

Yugiri praises Gosetsu's skill with healing magicks, prompting him to stress that he is still but a novice. It is for that reason that, unfortunately, he must once more leave on pilgrimage to hone his skills─though he reassures a disappointed Hien that he will fly to his side should the need arise. And so the former samurai takes his leave, prompting you to make ready to return to your other affairs as well. Hien thanks you once more for your aid, and bids you relay word of the blasphemy's demise to their representative at Radz-at-Han.</target>
