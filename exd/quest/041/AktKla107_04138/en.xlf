She theorizes the device contains some heretofore forgotten knowledge, but a faulty connector may be preventing the mammet from accessing this repository of wisdom. To that end, she bids you fashion a new connector that should finally allow the Golden Dhyata to function as it was intended.

※Check Rurusha's box for more materials should you run out while attempting to craft the gold connector.</target>

However, it soon becomes clear that her continued employment can only benefit the Studium when she presents the fruits of her labor. The relic all believed to be little more than rubbish is, in truth, capable of translating ancient languages. Professor Namono apologizes for his animosity, after which Montichaigne suggests the two professors work together in their pursuit of knowledge. With the inquiry ended, Rurusha invites you back to Makers' Meet to thank you properly.</target>
