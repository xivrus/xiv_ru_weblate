On this occasion, however, it will be employed to purify the corruption that plagues the Twelveswood. The branches of the great one have been delivered across the Twelveswood, and the final one is to be placed in Gridania itself. Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E asks you to do the honors, and bids you follow her to the Leatherworkers' Guild, where the ancient tree that will receive the branch resides.</target>
