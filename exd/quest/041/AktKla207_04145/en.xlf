This prompts Jude to lash out in his friend's defense, much to everyone's surprise. The poetry club members soon take their leave, and Jude implores Jeromere to accompany him in this last attempt to search for the Azure Star. He reluctantly agrees, and so the three of you make for Scholar's Harbor.</target>

Try as he might, however, the Azure Star fails to appear. As Jude begins to lose hope, you add your aether to his, strengthening the starlens's gaze into the heavens. Watching his friend struggle, Jeromere feels suddenly compelled to lend his strength as well. After a few moments, a new light begins to shine in the harbor─the Azure Star. Equal parts exhausted and elated, they return to Jude's workshop, their dream at last realized.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKLA207_04145_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Jeromere hypothesizes that modern telescopes fail to pick up on the existence of certain heavenly bodies, including the Azure Star, because they detect light rather than aether. By contrast, the starlens detects aetherial fluctuations, detecting the very life force of stars that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Jeromere is inspired to resume his studies in astronomy and explore the celestial skies alongside his dear friend. Jude bids you farewell, and though you may find yourselves worlds apart, you will always be with him each night when he gazes at the stars.</target>
