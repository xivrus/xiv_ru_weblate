        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA401_04120_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;At the mere sight of you, the Doman delegate is equal parts excited and relieved. As he tells it, dread beasts heralding the Final Days have begun to manifest in Doma, following the appearance of a blasphemy. Though they have made great strides in slaying the lesser creatures, the greater threat continues to elude them, keeping to the heavens and beyond the reach of their samurai and shinobi. To that end, Lord Hien seeks a marksman able to pluck the beast from the sky. You agree to answer their call for aid, and so he begs you make for the Doman Enclave, where Yugiri will receive you.</target>

A young man of Namai recently transformed into a terrible beast, inciting panic in the people as it fled. Hien would take swift action in slaying the creature, and so he and Yugiri leave with the villager for the Glittering Basin, and you are to follow.</target>

He runs off in a huff, and shortly after Isse arrives. It would seem that the young boy, Tonbo, pursued the beast born of his sibling when it fled their village, and Isse gave chase to ensure he did not come to harm. He goes on to explain the circumstances that have left the people of his village, and perhaps all of Doma, in the grips of despair. The youth's account gives Hien much to consider as you all return to the Doman Enclave.</target>

Meanwhile, Yugiri and the other shinobi will continue to hunt the blasphemy that yet eludes them. Until more is known, Hien bids you rest, that you may be ready and able to aid them once more.
