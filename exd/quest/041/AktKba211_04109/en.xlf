Since the recent incident in Ala Gannha, rumors have been spreading that suggest those with familial ties to the Crania Lupi are the ones most likely to turn, which has only served to isolate them further and exacerbate their plight. As the former commander of the imperial unit that she herself annihilated, Fordola has volunteered to investigate the matter, with you assigned to accompany her to Ala Gannha.</target>

Raganfrid's lamentations are interrupted by a man named Evrat, the brother of one of the Crania Lupi who has benefited from the efforts of the Silver Griffins. His expression soon darkens when he notices Fordola, the person responsible for his bereavement, and he is quickly overwhelmed by a malevolent aura, one with which you are all too familiar. In mere moments, his transformation into a beast is complete, and he moves to strike a young girl standing nearby. Fordola arrives in the nick of time, taking a blow to the shoulder before cutting him down. When she attempts to check on the creature's intended target, the girl's mother demands that she keep away from her child. Fordola turns to leave, but as her injury has yet to be treated, Raganfrid bids you go after her.</target>

For a moment, you fear she may transform into a beast in the same way as Evrat, but a few well-chosen words soon help her to regain control.
