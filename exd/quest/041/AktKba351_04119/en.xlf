The battle is joined, and this time you and your companions─aided by Lorens, who enters the fray somewhat late─succeed in defeating the blasphemy. With the beast at her mercy, Merlwyb fires the final bullet and puts it out of its misery once and for all. Two members of the Crushing Tide are present to witness the struggle, and are moved by your deeds and Merlwyb's words to put aside their hatred of the Lominsans and work towards peace. Your mission accomplished, you and your companions breathe a sigh of relief and prepare to sail home.</target>

Nevertheless, she understands he had his reasons, and is forever grateful to the man she considers a brother in all but blood. Lorens brushes aside her kind words, stressing that she has shouldered a heavy burden for a long time─too long, perhaps...but she is her father's daughter, and Limsa Lominsa yet has need of her leadership. His part in the tale finished for now, Lorens wishes Merlwyb and you well and goes off on his own once more.</target>
