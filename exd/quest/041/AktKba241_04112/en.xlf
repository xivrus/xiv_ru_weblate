It appears she witnessed the young girl's memories of a man she met moments before he transformed into the blasphemy you seek. Fordola was heard to utter the name “Charlet,” and though it is unfamiliar to your present company, Raganfrid may have useful information to share.</target>

After learning of the deaths of his brother and the other Skulls, he blamed himself for abandoning his friends and eventually disappeared.
