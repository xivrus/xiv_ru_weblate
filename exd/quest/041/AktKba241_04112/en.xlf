It appears she witnessed the young girl's memories of a man she met moments before he transformed into the blasphemy you seek. Fordola was heard to utter the name “Charlet,” and though it is unfamiliar to your present company, Raganfrid may have useful information to share.</target>

They were also childhood friends of Fordola's, and while Ansfrid joined the army, Charlet's compassionate demeanor made him unsuited to a life in the military. After learning of the deaths of his brother and the other Skulls, he blamed himself for abandoning his friends and eventually disappeared. As the pieces of the puzzle come together, you ponder the bigger picture as you make your way back to Ala Gannha.</target>
