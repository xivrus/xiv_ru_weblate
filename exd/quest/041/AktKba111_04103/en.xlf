Their pleasant reunion is undercut by tension, as fear of Gleipnir grips the remote community. Although none of its residents have come to harm, Raya&lt;var 1F /var&gt;O believes that it is only a matter of time before the blasphemy strikes. She urges her sister to entreat the elementals for aid, but the Elder Seedseer is reluctant to do so just yet. For now, she decides to speak with the people of Camp Tranquil, that she might assuage their fears and assure them that this crisis will soon pass.</target>

Per the Elder Seedseer's earlier instruction, however, all are to remain within the safety of the camp until the threat has passed. Nevertheless, the people are adamant that they be allowed to cross the border, and the Wood Wailers are but few, and so the Elder Seedseer goes to resolve the situation before it comes to a head.</target>

Before it can claim his life, however, despair takes hold of his heart, and he turns into a beast. The man beside him recoils in shock and, after crying out for his lost companion, undergoes a similar transformation. Both must be slain before they flee and spread terror throughout the Twelveswood.</target>

The Elder Seedseer finally accepts that she must seek the aid of the great one, but there are preparations that must be seen to beforehand.
