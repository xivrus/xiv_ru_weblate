Their pleasant reunion is undercut by tension, as fear of Gleipnir grips the remote community. Although none of its residents have come to harm, Raya&lt;var 1F /var&gt;O believes that it is only a matter of time before the blasphemy strikes. She urges her sister to entreat the elementals for aid, but the Elder Seedseer is reluctant to do so just yet.

Per the Elder Seedseer's earlier instruction, however, all are to remain within the safety of the camp until the threat has passed.
