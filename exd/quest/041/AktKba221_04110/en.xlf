The sultana reaffirms her commitment to treating all Ala Mhigans who reside in her city equally, regardless of their background. While this will go some way to easing their troubles, Arenvald suggests further measures, namely a memorial ceremony dedicated to all who died during the occupation and war for independence─including Ala Mhigans who sided with Garlemald. As the guests would presumably include staunch loyalists and relatives of collaborators, Raubahn expresses concerns that such an event may invite disaster. He does, however, concede that only by confronting these issues can they begin to move forward as one people, and he thus offers Arenvald his full support.</target>
