				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKBA101_04102_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The effort to find the blasphemy is being led by none other than the Elder Seedseer herself, Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Senna. She explains that their troubles began after an unidentified man transformed into a hideous beast which the people dubbed Gleipnir─so named for its similarity to a creature of legend which bears chain-like patterns on its hide. Its claws and horns appear to be coated with a potent poison that causes these selfsame patterns to manifest on an injured victim's skin. This mark is disturbingly similar to one caused by an infamous sickness known as the Creeping Death. Alas, unlike the sickness, those poisoned by Gleipnir cannot be cured by medicine or magick. This leaves you with few options to combat the beast, and as you contemplate this problem, Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E's attendant receives a chilling message via linkpearl: Gleipnir has struck again. Fortunately, the victim yet lives and is being conveyed to Fallgourd Float, and so the Elder Seedseer bids you accompany her to the settlement and speak with Aethelmaer, its overseer.</target>

The vilekin are known to carry the Creeping Death, and the Hearer fears that allowing them into Fallgourd Float would spark panic among its people.

The distraught Elder Seedseer strives not to let her emotions cloud her judgment, and concludes that Gleipnir's poison must be far too powerful to be carried by chigoes or any other ordinary creature; the people need only ware the blasphemy. While this knowledge comes as a relief of sorts, you are no closer to stopping the blasphemy. The beast must first be found, and to that end the Elder Seedseer suggests returning to the Adders' Nest to scour recent reports for any new information.</target>

However, when panic clouds judgment, a rabbit in the brush is often mistaken for something much more sinister. The Order of the Twin Adder must nevertheless carefully consider every report and determine which merit further investigation. And so, Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E's attendant asks that you stay safe in the meantime.
