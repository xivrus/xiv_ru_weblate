Nevertheless, she is resolved to help however she can, and joins you in discussing your next course of action. She suggests that identifying the man Gleipnir was before its transformation might help you gain insight into its behavior, prompting you to share the vision granted to you by the Echo. Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Senna then reveals that the young Padjal you saw was Ea&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Sura&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Supin, childhood friend and fellow student, who was stripped of his horns after being deceived. Though he was cast out for his mistake and seemingly vanished, E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Sumi&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Yan tells you that the boy sought the counsel of the moogles, hoping to find a way to regain the elementals' favor. Fortunately, the reclusive beings can be easily found in the Bramble Patch.</target>

One of the pair, Pukwa Pika, further explains that the moogles are hard at work cleansing the corruption that has spread throughout the woods. Asking for your help, she rises high into the air so as to survey the surrounding land. Although no obvious pathway up is available to you, it is plain the moogle means for you to follow her.</target>

Her enthusiasm is dampened, however, when she learns that the corruption is spreading faster than the moogles can cleanse it. As an alternative approach, Kupdi Koop suggests following in the footsteps of Jorin, sire of the first Padjal, who planted saplings throughout the Twelveswood in a show of fellowship with the elementals. All present agree this is a fine idea, and the moogles head off into the Twelveswood to gather what saplings they can. The Elder Seedseer's attendant at the Adders' Nest will want to know of this new development.</target>
