Before you leave, however, you are approached by a man who is surprised to see the Elder Seedseer in his village, and distressed to learn her purpose in coming there. He protests her efforts to placate the elementals at the expense of her people, as he perceives it. As Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Senna attempts to calm him, she learns that they suffered tragedy in the days preceding Gleipnir's appearance, when the Creeping Death claimed the life of a poor woman─the wife of a man she soon realizes is Ea&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Sura&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Supin, her childhood friend who was stripped of his Padjal horns and cast out many years ago. The nature of Gleipnir's apparent hostility towards the elementals becomes clear: the blasphemy is driven by the lingering resentment of one who grew to believe he had been twice robbed of purpose by the guardians of the Twelveswood.

While it is grateful for your efforts to cleanse the Twelveswood of corruption, the elementals still fear the blasphemy's poison, and are reticent to lend their strength. The Keeper of the Entwined Serpents protests, and is joined a moment later by a chorus of other voices─people come from all across Gridania to lend their support to their leader. Moved by this display, the great one relents and offers up branches of the Guardian Tree, instructing those present to attach them to the oldest trees in the forest. By doing so will the great one be able to channel its power to every corner of the woods, purging once and for all the corruption from their home. The end of Gridania's great ordeal draws near, and the Elder Seedseer returns to the city to prepare.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="8" approved="yes"><source>8</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA141_04106_SEQ_08&lt;tab&gt;Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Senna's attendant informs you that the people are hard at work bearing the Guardian Tree's many branches to the far reaches of the Twelveswood, in preparation for the final ceremony the Elder Seedseer must perform.
