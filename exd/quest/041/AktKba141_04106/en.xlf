She senses that the flow of aether has become warped near Greentear, and so it is decided that it will be your first destination.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA141_04106_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;The corruption in Hyrstmill is faint, and the ceremony is carried out quickly and without incident. Before you leave, however, you are approached by a man who is surprised to see the Elder Seedseer in his village, and distressed to learn her purpose in coming there. He protests her efforts to placate the elementals at the expense of her people, as he perceives it. As Kan&lt;var 1F /var&gt;E&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Senna attempts to calm him, she learns that they suffered tragedy in the days preceding Gleipnir's appearance, when the Creeping Death claimed the life of a poor woman─the wife of a man she soon realizes is Ea&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Sura&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Supin, her childhood friend who was stripped of his Padjal horns and cast out many years ago. The nature of Gleipnir's apparent hostility towards the elementals becomes clear: the blasphemy is driven by the lingering resentment of one who grew to believe he had been twice robbed of purpose by the guardians of the Twelveswood. More resolved than ever to see this crisis resolved, the Elder Seedseer makes for Everschade, where the great one slumbers, to beseech its aid.</target>

While it is grateful for your efforts to cleanse the Twelveswood of corruption, the elementals still fear the blasphemy's poison, and are reticent to lend their strength. The Keeper of the Entwined Serpents protests, and is joined a moment later by a chorus of other voices─people come from all across Gridania to lend their support to their leader. Moved by this display, the great one relents and offers up branches of the Guardian Tree, instructing those present to attach them to the oldest trees in the forest. By doing so will the great one be able to channel its power to every corner of the woods, purging once and for all the corruption from their home. The end of Gridania's great ordeal draws near, and the Elder Seedseer returns to the city to prepare.</target>
