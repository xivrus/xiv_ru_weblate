        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA531_04129_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;As you begin conversing with Artoirel, Aymeric arrives with grim news: upon being confronted, those who had abetted Bishop Vartinoix in his attempt to summon King Thordan turned into beasts and were subsequently put down. Deprived of their accounts, you consider other ways to confirm the clone and Vaindreau are one and the same, and it is decided that you will attempt to retrace their movements. While Artoirel heads to Azys Lla, you and Aymeric will make inquiries at Camp Dragonhead, where Vaindreau was first taken upon being found in the wilds.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA531_04129_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;At the conclusion of your search, you are surprised to find not only the wreckage of the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Soleil&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, the archbishop's personal vessel, but Profane Fafnir itself lying nearby. At the sight of the imposing creature, you experience visions of Vaindreau's past─from the time his ship crash-landed to when he fled the infirmary. Coming out of your reverie, you steel yourself for a confrontation with the dread blasphemy, but instead of attacking, the beast elects to flee. After that close encounter, Aymeric suggests returning to Ishgard.

※In the event that you leave the strategy room, you may re-enter by speaking with the Temple Knight guard at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA531_04129_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Back at the Congregation, you share your revelations with Aymeric and Artoirel, confirming beyond a doubt that the clone and Vaindreau are one and the same. Based on what is known of primals, the man's confusion can be attributed to the mixture of memories he inherited from the multiple individuals who had transformed into King Thordan and his knights twelve. Though the Heavens' Ward took up arms against him and his allies, Aymeric laments their terrible fate, and expresses his fear that other Ishgardians who have become disillusioned with the church may succumb to despair and turn as Vaindreau and the clergymen did. Given courage by your words, the lord speaker makes the decision to hold an ecumenical council, that the church might establish new doctrine, and sets off to make the necessary preparations.

※The next role quest will be available from Artoirel upon reaching level 89 in any magical ranged DPS class.</target>
