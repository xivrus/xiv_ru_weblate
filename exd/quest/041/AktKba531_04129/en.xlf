Deprived of their accounts, you consider other ways to confirm the clone and Vaindreau are one and the same, and it is decided that you will attempt to retrace their movements.

At the sight of the imposing creature, you experience visions of Vaindreau's past─from the time his ship crash-landed to when he fled the infirmary. Coming out of your reverie, you steel yourself for a confrontation with the dread blasphemy, but instead of attacking, the beast elects to flee. After that close encounter, Aymeric suggests returning to Ishgard.

Based on what is known of primals, the man's confusion can be attributed to the mixture of memories he inherited from the multiple individuals who had transformed into King Thordan and his knights twelve. Though the Heavens' Ward took up arms against him and his allies, Aymeric laments their terrible fate, and expresses his fear that other Ishgardians who have become disillusioned with the church may succumb to despair and turn as Vaindreau and the clergymen did. Given courage by your words, the lord speaker makes the decision to hold an ecumenical council, that the church might establish new doctrine, and sets off to make the necessary preparations.
