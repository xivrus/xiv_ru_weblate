I would give you a hefty sack of coin if you could retrieve it for me.</target>

I suggest sharpening your weapons beforehand, but I won't tell you how to do your job.</target>

Of course, I'm sure I said that the droppings &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;resemble&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; mud, didn't I? Regardless, I aim to speed up the ripening process, creating in days what takes nature centuries to accomplish. If I succeed, farmers across the realm will rejoice, and they will have you to thank for it!</target>
