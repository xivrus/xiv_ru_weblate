Although there is a strong chance they will refuse to attend a ceremony that involves mourning the deaths of Ala Mhigans branded traitors, Arenvald believes your presence might tip the scales. In addition to the basic details of the invitations themselves, he has also provided a brief but heartfelt treatise. Even should his offer be declined, the invitees will at least comprehend his reasons for hosting the event.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKBA231_04111_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Now that delegates from each of the Ala Mhigan communities have arrived in the Royal Palace, Raganfrid opens the proceedings. Several guests are quick to voice their objections to the memorial ceremony, and for a few moments, it seems that the differences of opinion may be irreconcilable after all. Raubahn cuts through the din of bickering voices to state his intent, which goes some way to easing the tension in the room, though a few remain unconvinced. It is then that Arenvald takes the floor, delivering an impassioned speech which seems to have won over the naysayers. The discussion then turns from the “why” of the ceremony to the “how” as they set about deciding the finer details of the event.</target>
