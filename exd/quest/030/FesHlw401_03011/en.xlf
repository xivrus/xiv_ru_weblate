				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;It is a day like any other in Gridania, except that a wolfman from Doma has wandered into the city and expressed a desire to join the Continental Circus. Said circus is, of course, no place for any good-hearted individual─beastman or otherwise─and the investigator is desperate to save the Lupin from a life of devilry. For lack of a better plan, he begs you to join the Continental Circus along with the Doman traveler.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

He explains that he wishes to turn his uncommon appearance to his advantage by joining the troupe, where he believes he will be welcomed with open arms and be rich in “nakama” or some such. Yet all who wish to become a member of the Continental Circus must first receive the blessing of the Impresario...</target>

First, however, you must complete a simple task. To wit, you must frighten several Gridanians for reasons the Impresario is quick to obfuscate. While Soga may use his gods-given gifts to accomplish this, you must rely on other means provided by the Continental Circus: a guise of the werewolf, which you may use to assume a rather more beastly form!</target>
