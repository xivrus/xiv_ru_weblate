        <target state="final">TEXT_FESHLW401_03011_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;It is a day like any other in Gridania, except that a wolfman from Doma has wandered into the city and expressed a desire to join the Continental Circus. Said circus is, of course, no place for any good-hearted individual─beastman or otherwise─and the investigator is desperate to save the Lupin from a life of devilry. For lack of a better plan, he begs you to join the Continental Circus along with the Doman traveler.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
