				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESVLT401_03082_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Valentione's Day, that celebration of ardor and affection, is come to Eorzea once more, and the indomitable Lisette de Valentione has returned to spread the message of love across the land. This year, she and her crew are collaborating with the Sanctum of the Twelve to deliver an all-new experience in matchmaking, and she cordially invites you to participate before seamlessly transitioning into a request. She asks that you lend a hand to a trainee named Astrid, whom she worries is too sober and rational to discharge her duties. If you have a mind to oblige, you will find the girl nearby at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

The three moogles tasked with setting up the venue have abandoned their work, and at this rate the event cannot begin. It falls to you to seek out the moogles and discover the reason behind their untimely desertion.</target>

Thus informed, you turn your steps back to Astrid.</target>

Nevertheless, she is determined to rectify the issues raised and make the test fit for public enjoyment. Here, Hortefense shamelessly maneuvers himself into the conversation and suggests that you turn to a moogle for advice. Though loath to accept any sort of help from her brother-in-law, Astrid concedes that he speaks true, and together you set off to find Kuplu Kumu, the leader of the Sanctum choir.</target>

While she and Kuplu Kumu discuss ways to improve it, you are tasked with rounding up the three lazy moogles. They are like to be found over by the Leatherworkers' Guild, their preferred place for being unproductive.</target>

All that remains, then, is to have a couple actually trial the test, henceforth known as the Valentione's Ceremony, and Astrid would have you and your chosen partner do the honors. When you are ready, the House Valentione servant will escort you to the venue.
