        <target state="final">TEXT_BANANA302_03043_ESHANA_000_000&lt;tab&gt;As I'm sure you recall, the battle to reclaim Castellum Velodyna was quite fierce. Naturally, the bridge did not remain unssscathed, and it is our resssponsibility to tend to its repair and maintenance. The problem, however, is we lack the proper materials to do so.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANANA302_03043_ESHANA_000_001&lt;tab&gt;The Garleans erected this bridge using materials not often found in this region, but the cermet plating from their war machines has ssserved well in our work. If you could retrieve, say, three sheets of this plating, your effortsss would be greatly appreciated.</target>
