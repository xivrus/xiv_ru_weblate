The problem, however, is we lack the proper materials to do so.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANANA302_03043_ESHANA_000_001&lt;tab&gt;The Garleans erected this bridge using materials not often found in this region, but the cermet plating from their war machines has ssserved well in our work.
