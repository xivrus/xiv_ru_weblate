Having heard rumors of a contingent of fellow undead on a certain island in the Sirensong Sea, he embarked on a grand journey...only to find at his destination the various skeletons wholly devoid of unlife, owing to your prior intervention. After gently chiding you for your propensity for violence against the undead, he further explains that he continued on to the Far East after sensing the presence of Master Zombibrand, for whom he is still searching. Oh, and somewhere along the way he acquired some werewolf attire, because life is funny like that.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="5" approved="yes"><source>5</source><target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB722_03021_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;With the aid of the Gentle Dead Man, you finally catch up to the Wolf Burglar, as he flees across the Isle of Bekko with a still-frozen Inspector Hildibrand on his back. Resolving once more to restore her mentor to the land of the moving, Nashu draws forth a set of her infamous Delights and heaves them into the inspector's waiting arms. The resulting explosion leaves the awakened Hildibrand and the annoyed Wolf Burglar clinging to opposite sides of a rocky bridge, the ground far below promising a swift and painful death. Nashu assures you, however, that the inspector will surely survive the fall, having lived through the rather more harrowing experience of returning to the star from the false moon, Dalamud. And so you all prepare to seize the Wolf Burglar and bring him to justice at last, only to watch helplessly as he escapes astride a giant bird of prey that swoops in at the last moment to catch him, in yet another twist that you really ought to have seen coming. Shortly thereafter, Inspector Hildibrand rejoins you atop the cliffs, albeit for only an instant, as his keen inspector's sense alerts him to a petitioner in need not far away.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="6" approved="yes"><source>6</source><target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB722_03021_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;You find Inspector Hildibrand conversing with a wayward Qiqirn, who claims to be a sailor on a ship belonging to the East Aldenard Trading Company. It would seem that he and his fellow Qiqirn were lured by promises of delicious foodstuffs into a dark alley, where they were set upon by men who bound and gagged his friend. Though he himself managed to escape by jumping into the sea, the current carried him to the island, and he knows not what became of his comrade─but you do. Indeed, in all likelihood he is the Qiqirn you saw at the auction─the selfsame auction where Inspector Hildibrand was nearly sold as a statue.

Indeed, he does not, for Shigure is no more than a common ronin with no ties to the Sekiseigumi─a ronin whom the broker hired to guard the auction which was robbed by the Wolf Burglar. Though Inspector Hildibrand reiterates that the broker's crimes are impossible to deny, it seems he will escape justice...until a man of the Sekiseigumi steps forward and asserts his own authority, placing the broker under arrest. The samurai thanks Shigure for his efforts, only to then chastise him for his recklessness, stating that he still cannot in good conscience permit him to join their ranks. After the samurai and the others depart, Shigure confesses how he came to Kugane to pursue his dream of joining the Sekiseigumi, only to fail and struggle to make ends meet. By bringing the Wolf Burglar to justice, he hopes to convince the Sekiseigumi to reconsider their decision. This simple, earnest desire is apparently enough to win over Inspector Hildibrand, who declares then and there his intention to help Shigure capture the Wolf Burglar, before dashing off to kami know where with his characteristic gusto.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="8" approved="yes"><source>8</source><target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB722_03021_SEQ_08&lt;tab&gt;Though Shigure is grateful for Inspector Hildibrand's promise of assistance, he suspects he may come to rely more upon you in the future.
