        <target state="final">TEXT_BANANA004_03039_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;An Ala Mhigan traveler returning to his homeland has fallen ill while staying at Castellum Velodyna. While Alpa and J'olhmyn are discussing his condition, M'zhet Tia, self-proclaimed future nunh of the M tribe, makes an unexpected appearance and reveals that he has in fact volunteered to aid the Gatekeepers. He also claims that the stricken guest is in fact lovesick, a concept Alpa finds hard to grasp. With total disregard for more immediate concerns, M'zhet asks the group to meet him at Pike Falls, where he will demonstrate the power of love.
