Though you struggle to comprehend how they could possibly have escaped Doma Castle alive, the fact remains that the Garleans were sufficiently convinced to dispatch a sizable contingent of soldiers to hunt them down. Never one to leave a comrade at an enemy's mercy, you agree to join Yugiri in her quest for the truth.</target>

Promising no more funny business, he shares a promising lead: an elderly Roegadyn samurai recently sold a katana of surpassing craftsmanship to a pawnbroker on Kogane Dori. While Alisaie accompanies Gyodo to a meeting with his imperial connections, you and the others will seek out the pawnbroker to ascertain whether the weapon in question did indeed belong to Gosetsu.</target>
