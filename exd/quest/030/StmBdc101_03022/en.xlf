        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDC101_03022_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;At the Ruby Bazaar, Hancock shares a tantalizing rumor: that individuals resembling Gosetsu and Yotsuyu were but recently seen walking the streets of Kugane. Though you struggle to comprehend how they could possibly have escaped Doma Castle alive, the fact remains that the Garleans were sufficiently convinced to dispatch a sizable contingent of soldiers to hunt them down. Never one to leave a comrade at an enemy's mercy, you agree to join Yugiri in her quest for the truth.</target>

While Alisaie accompanies Gyodo to a meeting with his imperial connections, you and the others will seek out the pawnbroker to ascertain whether the weapon in question did indeed belong to Gosetsu.</target>
