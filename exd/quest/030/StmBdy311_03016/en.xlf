Coincidentally, the moment the Kojin chieftain voices his concern, you are contacted by Tataru, who is bound for the temple to deliver a treat to the hardworking Soroban...</target>

Therefore, to accelerate the training process, he would have you retrieve a relic known as the tamate-bako of geomancy, which has the power to manipulate time itself, and transform Soroban into an auspice─albeit until the magicks dissipate. The box can be found deep within the Swallow's Compass, the ancient mausoleum of Ganen, the founder of the Kingdom of Doma and father of Far Eastern geomancy. Given the nature of the task, it would be prudent to call upon several of your allies.</target>

Nevertheless, you and your comrades must overcome these guardians and whatever other trials you encounter, and lay claim to the tamate-bako of geomancy.

Genbu quickly pushes her aside, but too late to spare her entirely, as she is transformed into a hideous crone...for some few moments. Alas, her reckless actions serve to distract Genbu from Soroban, whose prolonged exposure to the smoke leads him to transform into an auspice already consumed by the aramitama.

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_STMBDY311_03016_SEQ_08&lt;tab&gt;In the aftermath of Soroban's training session, Genbu takes the opportunity to share with you the tale of how he first met Tenzen, when he was only five hundred or so years old. Though not yet a full-fledged auspice, the turtle had for centuries been possessed of a powerful clairvoyance, which bestowed upon him visions of terrible calamities he had been powerless to prevent. On that fateful day, Genbu went unto a village soon to be destroyed in a landslide, and made a desperate attempt to warn its people. Alas, none could understand him...save a wandering samurai who heeded his words and, with the aid of a great white tiger, drove the villagers from their doomed homes and saved them from certain death. Thereafter the three became traveling companions and close friends, who swore to use their gifts to do good.

While Tenzen has long since passed away, his former comrades have found in you and Soroban (and perhaps Tataru) new allies to carry on his legacy and safeguard the Ruby Sea. As the Kojin returns to his training and Tataru takes her leave, Genbu tells you that the next time he calls upon you, it will likely be to help him confront one of his fellow Four Lords.</target>
