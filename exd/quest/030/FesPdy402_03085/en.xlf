Far removed from the glowing lights and cheers of the crowd before them, however, they spied an unexpected sight─a young girl sulking by her lonesome, seemingly lost. Knowing they cannot abandon their tight schedule of performances, the royal seneschal turns to you for help in locating this wayward soul.

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESPDY402_03085_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You find a young girl near the Gate of Nald, sullen and withdrawn. She has lost a gift from her parents─a necklace and pair of earrings─and is too racked with worry to enjoy the day's festivities. Your offer to search for them in her stead is met with disbelief followed by heartfelt gratitude. She tells you she remembers where they were lost, but rather than explain in words, she draws you a picture of the location. With her artwork in hand, you exit the gate out into central Thanalan.</target>

Indeed, you have found the correct locale, and an inspection of the area turns up a necklace and earrings. They are so old and worn, however, you question if they are what you were sent to find. The only thing left to do is return to Ul'dah and see if the jewelry you found is truly hers.</target>

She disappeared as a child on Little Ladies' Day, her family of the belief she was abducted and sold for some nefarious end. The reason for her ghostly visit to Ul'dah, he believes, is she never had the opportunity to enjoy Little Ladies' Day and be treated like a princess. But thanks to you, her unfinished business is complete. The royal seneschal will certainly be happy to hear the news.</target>
