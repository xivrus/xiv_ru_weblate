Your offer to search for them in her stead is met with disbelief followed by heartfelt gratitude. She tells you she remembers where they were lost, but rather than explain in words, she draws you a picture of the location.

She disappeared as a child on Little Ladies' Day, her family of the belief she was abducted and sold for some nefarious end.
