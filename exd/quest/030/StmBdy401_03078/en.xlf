The island in question is apparently somewhere in the Far East, and if you are interested in learning more, you will have no choice but to journey once more to distant Kugane and speak with Kotokaze, the esteemed proprietress of the Shiokaze Hostelry.</target>

The pair explain that they have joined forces in an effort to develop the aforementioned island, which could serve as a new port of call for trading vessels seeking to circumvent the high tariffs of Kugane. Alas, this will not be a simple endeavor, as the previous expedition met with failure at the hands─rather, the claws and teeth─of the innumerable savage beasts that inhabit the island. Warriors of consummate skill are needed, and you stand above all others in their minds. Krile, for her part, has a personal stake in the expedition, though she begs leave to say no more unless her suspicions regarding the island prove true.</target>
