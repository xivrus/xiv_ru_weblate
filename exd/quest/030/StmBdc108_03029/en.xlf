        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Lord Hien has agreed to the proposed exchange of prisoners on one condition: that Yotsuyu be granted exemption from the transaction should her memory fail to return by the appointed hour. Though plainly displeased by this stipulation, Asahi eventually consents, but not without making one final request: a moment to speak with his beloved sister in private. Hien duly grants his wish, and Asahi is admitted to Yotsuyu's quarters. Doing your best to ignore Gosetsu's obvious anxiety, you wait without, imagining the worst, but when Asahi finally emerges, he concedes that Yotsuyu's condition is not feigned, and entrusts her to Hien's care. It would seem that all is well.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDC108_03029_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Moments prior to departing, Asahi pulls you aside to offer special thanks. Or so he claims. With his back turned to the others, his smile quickly changes to a scowl, and he issues an ominous threat. Yet even as he begins to speak, you are overcome by a vision of the past, wherein you discover he is in fact a fervent admirer of the late Lord Zenos. Realizing you have witnessed his thoughts only serves to stoke the flames in his eyes, and he castigates you for presuming to oppose his master before stalking away. You watch openmouthed as his airship disappears into the distance, dumbfounded by his sudden show of petulance.</target>

The tale leaves Yugiri and Alisaie understandably aghast, but Hien appears unmoved. Though he concedes the incident does not bode well for the coming prisoner exchange, he remains determined to see it through. After assuring you that he will send word when all of the necessary preparations have been made, he bids you rest, and so you depart for Kugane together with Alphinaud and Alisaie.</target>
