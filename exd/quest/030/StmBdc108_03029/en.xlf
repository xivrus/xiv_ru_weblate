Though plainly displeased by this stipulation, Asahi eventually consents, but not without making one final request: a moment to speak with his beloved sister in private. Hien duly grants his wish, and Asahi is admitted to Yotsuyu's quarters. Doing your best to ignore Gosetsu's obvious anxiety, you wait without, imagining the worst, but when Asahi finally emerges, he concedes that Yotsuyu's condition is not feigned, and entrusts her to Hien's care.

Yet even as he begins to speak, you are overcome by a vision of the past, wherein you discover he is in fact a fervent admirer of the late Lord Zenos. Realizing you have witnessed his thoughts only serves to stoke the flames in his eyes, and he castigates you for presuming to oppose his master before stalking away.

Though he concedes the incident does not bode well for the coming prisoner exchange, he remains determined to see it through.
