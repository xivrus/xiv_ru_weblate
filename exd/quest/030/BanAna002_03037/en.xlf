        <target state="final">TEXT_BANANA002_03037_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Castellum Velodyna looms large over Ala Mhigo, and it is a constant reminder of years of suffering at the hands of the Garleans that many citizens would rather see destroyed. Alpa seeks to placate those who oppose her project by introducing traditional Ala Mhigan designs, but she lacks the knowledge required to make informed choices. You suggest speaking to Tahla Molkoh stationed at Castrum Oriens, who is a wellspring of information on local history.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANANA002_03037_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Tahla Molkoh recommends the traditional motif of a pair of griffins, which symbolizes everlasting loyalty. This gives Alpa the idea of crafting a pair of metal griffin statues to decorate the castellum. Feeling that it would be best to base the sculptures on a real griffin, J'olhmyn suggests consulting Giff the beast trainer at Rhalgr's Reach.</target>

Although he is reluctant to help with what he considers to be a pointless endeavor, he agrees all the same. According to Giff, a griffin is at its most dynamic when creating its characteristic gusts of wind, with which they subdue their prey. Much to his surprise, Alpa expresses a desire to experience this powerful attack for herself to better understand the true nature of the winged beast. As Giff refuses to have any further part in this absurd plan, Alpa nominates you to ride the griffin.</target>
