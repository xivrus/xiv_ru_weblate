It would seem that he too is still in pursuit of the Wolf Burglar, and informs you of an impending private auction he is bound for that he suspects may be the thief's next target. Nashu quickly insists that you join, and so the three of you head towards Kogane Dori.</target>

He purchases the first item up for bid, which is described by the auctioneer as a legendary “ratman,” but which you and Nashu recognize at once to be an Eorzean Qiqirn. After the hapless beastman is shuffled away, the next item up for bid is brought on stage: &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;The Eoruzean Gentleman&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, which the auctioneer claims to be a triumph of Western sculpture, but which is plainly Inspector Hildibrand, somehow frozen in time. Once more Master Akebono is prepared to take on all comers, but before the sale can be finalized, the auction erupts into chaos when a bomb explodes and fills the area with smoke. When it clears, &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;The Eoruzean Gentleman&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; is nowhere to be seen. An all-too-familiar note reveals that the Wolf Burglar has struck again, and Master Akebono urges you to give chase, for he glimpsed the thief running towards the Short Pier.</target>
