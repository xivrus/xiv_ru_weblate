Without a reference point within the test world, however, he reluctantly admits that he has nothing to share on the nature of the opponents you might face. Your only option is to go in blind. As before, Alpha will transfer his existential authorization to you just as soon as you have stepped into the unknown...

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.</target>
