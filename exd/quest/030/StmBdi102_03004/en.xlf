Additional evidence is apparently to be found in the Durai Papers─a secret document passed down through countless generations of the Lexentale family...which is actually the Durai family. The tome, however, is written in High Ivalician, the secrets of translating which were lost along with Jenomis's stolen journal. As it will take some time for the principal and his family to recover from the theft, they have invited you to return to your adventures, with the promise that they will send for you if any additional assistance is required. Perhaps now would be an opportune moment to ask Lina Mewrilah for her thoughts on the story so far.</target>
