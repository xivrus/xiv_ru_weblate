Upon confirming that he is likely to survive, you attempt to make an expedient exit. However, a moment's hesitation costs you all plausible deniability. Resigned to facing whatever ordeal lies in store, you stuff the Namazu in your pack at his request, and set off for Yuzuka Manor.</target>

After drinking several times his weight in water, he recovers enough to explain that he is an artisan by the name of Gyoshin, and─though you give no indication of interest─continues on to tell you about his recent unusual dreams. Said dreams evidently include the Namazu's ancestor and a dire warning about the annihilation of their tribe, which can only be averted by holding a seven-year festival on the Azim Steppe. Between this pronouncement and the sudden dramatic entrance of a third Namazu, the self-proclaimed “Seigetsu the Enlightened,” you find yourself in no position to protest as they commandeer your services for this endeavor.</target>

The Namazu clearly have a long road ahead if their ideal doom-averting, culturally relevant event is to be realized, and they look to you to provide sorely needed competent assistance─or perhaps just cheap labor. Either way, there is much to be done. Touring the grounds at the Towering Still seems like as good a first step as any.</target>
