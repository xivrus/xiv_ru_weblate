Sadly, however, the vintner believes that Gegeruju is unlikely to accept a lingering scent in exchange for the Suhd Viandja. Luckily, Shamani Lohmani is, for once, not the only other soul in the winery, as Hancock of the East Aldenard Trading Company just happens to be visiting Eorzea on business. Having eavesdropped on your conversation, he proceeds to offer up a most wicked solution: fill the empty bottle with a Hingan red and pass it off as a genuine Lea Monde Valens. He even provides you with a bottle of the suggested substitute, free of charge. Though Shamani Lohmani vehemently disapproves, he quite literally turns a blind eye to your brazen act of counterfeiture. All that remains is to make the exchange.</target>
