Upon visiting the bedridden samurai, however, you are relieved to find him well on the path to recovery. Yotsuyu, meanwhile, seems much the same as when you last saw her─a child in a woman's body.

Some time later, a tale told by Yugiri convinces Lord Hien that Yotsuyu's plight is genuine, and he decides to allow her to live out her days in Doma as “Tsuyu.” The only obstacle remaining is to present proof of her condition to Asahi, and with this in mind, your allies agree to rendezvous at the enclave docks.</target>
