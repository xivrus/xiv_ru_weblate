        <target state="final">TEXT_BANANA006_03041_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Castellum Velodyna has undergone a dramatic transformation due to Alpa's ingenuity and ability to inspire others─although she would be the first to admit that none of this would have been possible without the loyal comrades at her side. In order to express her gratitude, she plans to hold a feast for a handful of her most steadfast supporters. After placing Gales in charge of procuring food and drink, she tasks you with delivering invitations to M'zhet Tia and Tahla Molkoh.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANANA006_03041_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;M'zhet Tia welcomes you with a broad smile and jumps at the chance of enjoying fine cuisine and fine company, especially since J'olhmyn will be attending. His response is in stark contrast to that of Tahla Molkoh, to whom the idea of eating anywhere other than a mess hall conjures images of stuffy high society banquets. She nonetheless accepts the invitation despite her concerns that she might commit some sort of social blunder.</target>

In her absence, J'olhmyn confides that she has noticed a significant change in Alpa of late, and suggests taking this opportunity to watch the leader of the Gatekeepers at work.</target>

There was a time when Alpa would have relied on you to eliminate such threats, but she has grown into a confident and capable battlemaid, and does not hesitate to take matters into her own hands. She makes for the forest with one of her new Qalyana allies at her side, leaving J'olhmyn to watch the castellum. Some time later, Alpa returns having slain the fiend, and it becomes clear that she has taken to the role of captain with aplomb.</target>

Before the meal, M'zhet finds himself dragged into a drinking contest with Gales, which quickly takes a turn for the worse as the young tia has an immediate and disastrous reaction to the spirits. Thankfully, this has little bearing on the proceedings, and shortly thereafter a sumptuous selection of culinary delights is laid out for all to enjoy, including a miraculously recovered M'zhet. The room is soon filled with conversation and laughter until Alpa rises to give a heartfelt speech, thanking her companions for their loyalty and friendship. She reaffirms her commitment to leading the Gatekeepers, while J'olhmyn pledges to support her as they continue their work at Castellum Velodyna.</target>
