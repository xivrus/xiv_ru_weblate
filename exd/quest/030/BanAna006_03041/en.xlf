In order to express her gratitude, she plans to hold a feast for a handful of her most steadfast supporters. After placing Gales in charge of procuring food and drink, she tasks you with delivering invitations to M'zhet Tia and Tahla Molkoh.

She makes for the forest with one of her new Qalyana allies at her side, leaving J'olhmyn to watch the castellum.

Before the meal, M'zhet finds himself dragged into a drinking contest with Gales, which quickly takes a turn for the worse as the young tia has an immediate and disastrous reaction to the spirits. Thankfully, this has little bearing on the proceedings, and shortly thereafter a sumptuous selection of culinary delights is laid out for all to enjoy, including a miraculously recovered M'zhet. The room is soon filled with conversation and laughter until Alpa rises to give a heartfelt speech, thanking her companions for their loyalty and friendship.
