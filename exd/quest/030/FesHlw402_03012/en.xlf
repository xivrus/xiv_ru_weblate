        <target state="final">TEXT_FESHLW402_03012_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;That you may strike fear into the hearts of the people of Gridania more effectively, the Impresario has furnished you with a guise of the wolf. Before you can begin your campaign of terror, he asks that you present yourself to him in your full wolflike splendor. To wit, you must equip a werewolf head, a werewolf body, a pair of werewolf arms, and a pair of werewolf bottoms, which may be obtained from a werewolf attire coffer.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Whatever the troupe's true objectives, the people of Gridania and Soga seem to be satisfied. One can only hope that the Adventurers' Guild investigator will be as well.</target>
