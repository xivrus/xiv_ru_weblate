Before you can begin your campaign of terror, he asks that you present yourself to him in your full wolflike splendor. To wit, you must equip a werewolf head, a werewolf body, a pair of werewolf arms, and a pair of werewolf bottoms, which may be obtained from a werewolf attire coffer.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
