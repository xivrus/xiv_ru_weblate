Knowing what Allagan horrors once roamed its confines, they dare not investigate alone. To that end, Philiot was sent to request your assistance. You consent, and he readies himself for a long journey to Azys Lla.</target>

From what you can hear of his conversation, an intruder in the Fractal Continuum has triggered its anti-intruder systems, ruling out entrance via teleportation. The thought of piloting the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enterprise&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; to get inside terrifies Philiot. Thankfully, he will be accompanied by the Warrior of Light. With you at his side, he musters up the courage to board the airship and embark on a journey to the depths of the Allagans' great technological museum.</target>

Much to Philiot's relief, your surpassing strength proved the reason for their inferiority. With the source of the strange signal decommissioned, he suggests returning to Matter Conduit VI&lt;var 1F /var&gt;VII to confirm the teleporters are once again operational.</target>

You spy an Ixal in the distance with his head hung low whom Philiot presumes was the cause for your troubles. Considering the difficulty of reaching Azys Lla via an ordinary airship, he surmises the Ehcatl Nine are the only Ixal with the technological know-how to have made the voyage. He wishes to have a word with them for fear of another incident in the Fractal Continuum.</target>

Though he is furious at Kezul for stealing their airship, Sezul calms himself to ask why he would risk his life to return there. The answer is alarming. Among the chimerical monstrosities lining the walls of the Fractal Continuum, Kezul came across a creature that bears a striking resemblance to the Ixal. He soon came to the startling realization that they are a failed experiment of the Allagans, and the Ayatlan they yearned to return to is nothing more than a test tube. Sezul cares not for this revelation, reminding Kezul the dreams of the Ehcatl Nine were born from no one but themselves. They agree to keep this truth hidden from the others, and continue to search for a place the Ixal can call paradise.</target>
