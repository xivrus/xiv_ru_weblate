She is come to Kugane in search of her missing mentor, last seen hurtling through the heavens towards the Far East, and was mere moments away from accepting the assistance of another familiar face: Gyodo, the conniving trickster who attempted to betray you to the Garleans once upon a time. Upon realizing that his latest victim is your associate, he beats a quick retreat, leaving you alone with the downcast woman.</target>

The merchant has little new information to share, save for a note presumably left by the perpetrator, which proudly declares that, “You have just been robbed by the Kugane Wolf Burglar!” If there was any doubt before that Inspector Hildibrand would be tempted by this case, it was extinguished in that moment, for no self-respecting inspector could abide a thief so brazen as to leave a calling card.</target>
