What began as a small frontier outpost grew into a thriving community, and much of this is owed to the contributions of the Far Eastern refugees. As all present struggle to fight back the tears, promises are made to preserve the relationship between the Domans and the Eorzeans. Finally, as a parting gift, Slafborn offers his dear friends the so-called “lost treasure of Revenant's Toll,” the old wine found by the Doman children during their search of the camp obliterated in the Calamity years ago. As the Domans return to their preparations, he then asks you to seek out young Yozan and his friends, for it would seem that F'lhaminn has prepared a special surprise for them...</target>

However, when Hoary Boulder and Coultenet arrive to congratulate the children, Shiun starts to cry, not wanting to say good-bye. Hoary tells him not to, then, for as adventurers they are fated to wander, and they may meet again in the future. The children resolve to continue their training and become the most famous adventurers in Yanxia, and to one day return to Eorzea, that they might surpass the Scions and even you.</target>
