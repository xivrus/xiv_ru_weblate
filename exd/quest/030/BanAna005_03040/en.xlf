Upon hearing this unsettling news, Alpa's immediate concern is that her mother would be angry that Ananta should be allowed to cause trouble so close to Velodyna. Showing no signs of hesitation, she and J'olhmyn race off in the direction of the valley, heedless of the dangers they may face.

However, Alpa believes that the Qalyana would have little to gain from such an act of espionage and that any treachery can be dealt with as needed. While J'olhmyn is able to accept Alpa's argument, she remains cautious of the new recruits. Shortly after, Sarisha arrives to look over the castellum and reminds Alpa of the consequences should it fail to meet her standards. Although Alpa is extremely anxious to hear her mother's evaluation, she has no choice but to wait patiently, but is finally able to breathe a sigh of relief when the fortress passes the inspection. Not only was Alpa's work on the castellum beyond all expectations, but her bravery and even-handed diplomacy left a deep impression on the broodmother, who gives her blessing to continue working with the Gatekeepers.</target>
