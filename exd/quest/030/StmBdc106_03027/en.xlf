While Lord Hien deliberates over the proposed prisoner exchange, Asahi apparently wishes to take a trip around Yanxia. And who better to accompany him than the fabled Warrior of Light. Though you are sure he will be quite safe in Yugiri's company, it is plain that both would welcome your presence. You duly agree to join them, as does Alisaie, and the four of you set out for the town of Monzen.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDC106_03027_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Upon arriving in Monzen, Asahi is shocked to see what has become of the once-proud home of the samurai. Taking in the devastation wreaked under his sister's governance, he reaffirms his determination to put an end to the conflict between Doma and the Empire. That he might have a better view of the remnants of Doma Castle, Yugiri then leads him deeper into the ruins.</target>

Though Yugiri shares his sentiment, she observes that rebuilding such grand edifices will do little to help the people rebuild their lives. At the mention of Doma's long-suffering citizens, Asahi expresses a desire to visit Namai, recalling that the village is only a short journey away. To this end, Yugiri dutifully heads for the nearby docks to ready a boat to bear you back through the Moon Gates.</target>

Asahi runs off towards the source of the commotion without hesitation and you follow in turn. Moments later, you are surprised to find Isse and Azami surrounded by a group of Red Kojin. Thankfully, the thick-shelled sellswords prove no match for you, and beat a hasty retreat. The danger having passed, you turn your attention to Isse and Azami, anxious to find out if either one has come to harm.</target>
