Alas, it was actually a common dagger─old and worn and of Doman make. Yet therein may lie a clue as to the whereabouts of the thief, Shigure believes...</target>

Fortunately, your new comrade, Yojimbo, has brought with him Daigoro─loyal companion and good dog. After sniffing the Wolf Burglar's dagger, Daigoro woofs and bounds off towards Monzen, leaving the rest of you to follow.</target>

Nevertheless, he has led you this far, and your companions remain confident that they may find the Wolf Burglar or some trace of his passing nearby.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CHRHDB732_03095_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;In searching the ruins you come upon a Namazu in his death throes, who abruptly leaps to his feet and explains he is merely suffering from the world's worst hangover. A cursory questioning reveals that he may have seen the Wolf Burglar while he was deep in his teacups─a fact you share with Shigure and Hildibrand as they appear moments later. Due to the circumstances, the Namazu is reluctant to trust his memories to steer you the right way─his barbels, on the other hand, ought to do the trick. Curiously (but not altogether surprisingly), he directs you to proceed in the direction directly opposite the one indicated by Hildibrand's keen inspector's sense, leaving you no choice but to divide your efforts yet again.</target>

Well aware of the thief's rather vexing propensity for running away, you let the dog take the lead, only to learn that all it takes to distract Daigoro is a shiny gold koban hurled with sufficient force. For the umpteenth time, the Wolf Burglar seems poised to get away...until Hildibrand, with all his grace and beauty, unintentionally fells the thief's means of escape, allowing Shigure to tackle him and finally bring the chase to an end. Afterwards, Yojimbo verifies the Soboro Sukehiro's authenticity, and generously offers to take it back to Master Akebono, allowing you and the others to deliver the Wolf Burglar into the custody of the Sekiseigumi.</target>

Before storming off, a furious Akebono swears to Shigure that, should the ronin fail to recover the sword, he will ensure that his dreams go unfulfilled. Shortly thereafter, however, a certain Sekiseigumi takes no small joy in granting Shigure that which he has dreamed of for so long: a place among the protectors of Kugane. His first assignment: to track down Yojimbo and reclaim the Soboro Sukehiro. As a new recruit, Shigure has little to no resources, and must continue to rely upon you, Hildibrand, and Nashu for assistance. For their part, the inspector and his assistant are more than happy to oblige.</target>

Of course, he also hopes to bring Yojimbo to justice and secure the Soboro Sukehiro, if only to wash his hands of Master Akebono...</target>
