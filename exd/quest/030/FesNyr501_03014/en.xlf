For reasons unbeknownst to him, however, the people of Limsa Lominsa have failed to show even the faintest glimmer of interest. To that end he turns to you, an adventurer native to Eorzea, in the hopes of winning the townsfolk over. Together with his faithful boar, Ibukimaru, he asks you to spread word of their plans for the festival, and the advent cakes that will be handed out to any who should come to partake in their revelry.
