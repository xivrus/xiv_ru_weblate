        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR501_03014_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;A delegation led by the inoshishi bugyo has come from the Far East in the hopes of sharing their customs with the people of Eorzea during the coming Heavensturn festival. For reasons unbeknownst to him, however, the people of Limsa Lominsa have failed to show even the faintest glimmer of interest. To that end he turns to you, an adventurer native to Eorzea, in the hopes of winning the townsfolk over. Together with his faithful boar, Ibukimaru, he asks you to spread word of their plans for the festival, and the advent cakes that will be handed out to any who should come to partake in their revelry.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

His discomfort soon gives way to enthusiasm, however, when you explain the bugyo's plans for Heavensturn. Before taking his leave, he asks if you are certain about this year's totem animal. As he tells it, word has spread about town that it is the year of the cat. Hopefully this rumor has not yet spread too far.</target>

She quickly takes her leave, thoughts likely swimming with thoughts of rice cakes, but the cause for her misunderstanding remains a mystery.</target>

When you tell him Ibukimaru is part of the Heavensturn celebration, he is utterly flabbergasted. It seems someone convinced him the boar had caused a commotion so great the festival was called off.

He believes the cat has been denied its rightful place as a totem animal and intends to seek his revenge by ruining this year's celebration. In fact, he claims to have made powerful allies in Eorzea who will help see his plans come to fruition. No sooner does he take his leave than the mochi daikan arrives bearing terrible news. The mochi pounding sites are under siege by strange, feline creatures, and with no mochi for advent cakes, there can be no festival. And so you set out to save the mochi by participating in the FATE “A Mochi Catastrophe” in one of the following locations: southeast of the Zephyr Gate in middle La Noscea; east of the Salt Strand in lower La Noscea.</target>

When his gaelicat cohort fails to come to his aid, however, he collapses to the ground, lamenting the shattered dreams of cats everywhere. He begins to reminisce about a simpler time, when all he wanted was to share his love of cats with the world. Suddenly inspired by this stroll down memory lane, he proclaims he will see that dream realized, even if it requires nefarious means to do so. The neko bugyo then takes his leave, vowing revenge against the boar come next Heavensturn. A pity it will not be next year's totem animal. Nevertheless, &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;this&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; year's festival is safe, and the people of Limsa Lominsa can celebrate in peace.</target>
