It was only when he attempted to replicate the process detailed on the ancient scroll that he realized one particular vital piece of information was written in a cryptic fashion, perhaps deliberately, to prevent outsiders from learning the secrets of the Nabaath. Kee-Satt decides to seek out large pieces of genuine Nabaathium to compare with the ingots that he produced during the course of his experiments. You suggest visiting Mord Souq to seek the assistance of Ghun Gun, who has a keen interest in ancient history.</target>

After hearing of his dream of reproducing Nabaathium, Ghun Gun explains that the windmill's axle is in fact made from the very same metal, and after having been in use for over a hundred years, is in dire need of replacement. In exchange for their assistance in researching the alloy, Kee-Satt agrees to provide a new axle once his methods have been perfected. After a closer observation, he comes to the conclusion that the amounts of each ingredient listed on his scroll were most likely false, with the correct information being passed on verbally. Although he has no such source at his disposal, Kee-Satt now has an authentic piece of Nabaathium to use as a point of reference. He resolves to go return to his process of trial and error, confident that it is only a matter of time before he is able to replicate the alloy. The three thank you for uniting them under a common cause, and you prepare to return to Twine to report the good news to Horthur.</target>
