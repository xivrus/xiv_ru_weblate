No rope of ordinary make will suffice, though, for she is far stronger than the average finless one, and so Naroshs Koal implores you to seek out and slay several sea anemones that you might claim their tentacles as material.

Time passes without word from within, until finally you learn that the clutchmother and her eggs are well. For their loyal service, the two male Ondo are entrusted with an egg each, and though you are offered one as well at first, the clutchmother reconsiders after recognizing that you cannot possibly fertilize it, much less raise the resulting child as your own. Your joint duty complete, the newly named Naroshs Ooan begs a final moment to speak in private.</target>
