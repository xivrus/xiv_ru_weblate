Kee-Satt is ready to swing his pickaxe in the hopes of finding rutabite.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZH102_03526_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Kee-Satt's attempt to unearth rutabite ends in bitter failure. His Ronso rivals appear just as he admits defeat to─figuratively speaking─kick the man while he is down, and his earlier claims that they hold bigoted opinions of Mystel are substantiated when they cruelly mock him. This, however, only serves to spur him on, and with renewed vigor, he proposes moving on to another site. Unfortunately, this one is said to be riddled with dangerous cave dwellers, and he requests that you watch over him as he digs for ore.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

You take position some distance away, in anticipation of any creatures that would interfere with the young miner's work.</target>

Thankfully, it appears that the journey into the depths of Nuvy's Leavings was not wasted, and he beams with delight when telling you what he has discovered. The ore he holds in his hands certainly has the color of ripe dates, or rutab, as he had described, although he will need an expert's evaluation to determine whether it is the prize he seeks.</target>
