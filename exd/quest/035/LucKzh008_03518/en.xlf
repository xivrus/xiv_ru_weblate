If you're wondering about the chair─a little perk of my trade is getting to keep the odd luxury good for myself. I'm a provider, you see.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZH008_03518_ZOICHORR_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Think of me like...a merchant, except I don't set up shop.

I can provide that. And in return, you'll bring me back some information. Sound fair?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZH008_03518_ZOICHORR_000_003&lt;tab&gt;It's a deal. Now, as I said─I need information, and lots of it. Things like what just happened here, they change the status quo, you see. And that changes &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;demand&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;.

Nah, you've got your prudent folks, but you've also got your melodramatic fools, and those who can't add two and two to save their lives.
