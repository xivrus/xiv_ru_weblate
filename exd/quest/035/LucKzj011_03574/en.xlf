        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Ho there! You are the traveler who is the talk of the village, yes? Superb! There is a small favor I was hoping to ask of you. Have you, by chance, in your journeys across the realm, encountered those curious little creatures known as the Mord?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Splendid! That's just the answer I was hoping to hear. I would be most obliged if you could meet with a Mord merchant who's come to town and negotiate a simple transaction on my behalf.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_003&lt;tab&gt;I've asked around the village, but everyone─even some of the burliest fisherman types─seems downright frightened of the little fellow. I suppose they can't be blamed. We don't see many of their kind in these parts, after all, and the unfamiliar can be off-putting.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZJ011_03574_AMBARTH_000_022&lt;tab&gt;I mean to make a point that this would not be possible without the cooperation of the Mord. Eventually, I hope to convince them that the little fellows aren't so bad after all. They're actually quite charming, wouldn't you agree? At any rate, thank you, friend. I trust this will suffice as payment for your efforts?</target>
