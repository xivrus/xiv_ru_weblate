Alas, you and Naroshs Koal have yet to find a means to aid her, and so there is still considerable risk that she will not have sufficient strength to see it through. The young Ondo can think of no other option but to go and see the finless woman who saved him so many years ago. However, he is reluctant to approach her without gifts of the sea, and so he begs you search for a suitable shell while he hunts for other items of value.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
