Can you bring me four solid-looking planks, for the time being? Some of the wood from the old sunken ships ought to still be fit for use.</target>

Extracting it from its hiding place, you see that it's a ring─one that has fared rather poorly in the elements. Perhaps Tui-Shirr will know to whom it belongs.</target>
