        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZH101_03525_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Horthur, one of the leading figures among the miners of Twine, is worried about Kee-Satt, the sole Mystel member of the community. He claims that not only is the young man surly and uncommunicative, but that he also refuses to dig in the same locations as his colleagues, instead opting for those that have little chance of yielding anything of value. Horthur senses that as Kee-Satt is unwilling to confide in any of his peers, he may be more likely to share his troubles with an outsider such as yourself.

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZH101_03525_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Kee-Satt turns out to be far more talkative than you were led to believe, and once he starts, it is as if the floodgates have been opened. He tells you of his dream to revive the methods once used in Nabaath Areng to produce a versatile alloy known as Nabaathium. However, one essential piece of the puzzle is yet to be found: the elusive ore known as rutabite. Kee-Satt has been searching for a vein for quite some time, though he is reluctant to turn to his Ronso peers for help because of their prejudiced views on Mystel. He is determined to prove himself as a skilled miner, despite their claims otherwise, and he asks you to accompany him to Nuvy's Leavings and act as witness to the moment he finally discovers rutabite.</target>
