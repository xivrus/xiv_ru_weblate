The two of you decide to make for the road just outside Radisca's Round, where it is believed that Mauwyl's caravan was attacked. Hurry to your destination, and pray that the young woodcutter has not already come to harm.

It would appear that all the missing members have been found and led to safety, with the notable exception of Mauwyl, who remains unaccounted for. With time of the essence, Tolas suggests that you split up, that you might cover the most ground in your search efforts. The guardsman offers to search in the vicinity of Wolves of Shadow, and bids you sweep the southern edge of the forest for any signs of the young woodcutter.</target>

It would appear that the guardsman came upon the woodcutter just as he was about to become dinner for the fiend, and succeeded in overcoming his demons to vanquish the foe and save the young man's life. Tolas explains that traveling and conversing with you have returned to him a measure of clarity and peace, freeing him from the paralyzing effects of his lingering fear and shame. Both men say their thanks, then set off for the Ostall Imperative, bidding you visit them there so that they might properly express their gratitude.</target>
