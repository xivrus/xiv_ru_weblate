However, the darkness of the mine and lack of proper testing apparatus mean you will need to return to Twine to have the mineral inspected to determine whether it is indeed the object of your search.

He has all but abandoned his dream of recreating the lost alloy of Nabaath Areng, though a few words and emphatic gestures of encouragement may /rally his spirits.</target>

Realizing that he lacks reliable information, he decides to ask Horthur whether he knows of any locations where rutabite may be found. However, Kee-Satt has never been on particularly good terms with the senior miner, so he requests that you approach Horthur first in order to better facilitate the conversation.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKZH103_03527_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Kee-Satt's attempts to remain civil fall flat almost immediately, though thankfully this does little to faze Horthur. He patiently explains that since Twine was originally founded by Ronso and Mystel working in unison, it is important that the two races should not let their differences divide them. When the subject of rutabite is raised, he shares a tale of a mine in the Dragging Tail said to have collapsed over a hundred years ago, where the elusive ore was once found in abundance. Kee-Satt, with renewed determination, asks you to meet him outside of the settlement, from where you will begin the journey to the lost mine.</target>

He also concedes that in trying to outshine his Ronso rivals, he has been blindly digging away wherever his hunches take him, with little regard for proper research. Eager to chase the lead provided by Horthur, Kee-Satt prepares to venture into the inner reaches of the Dragging Tail.</target>
