Realizing that he lacks reliable information, he decides to ask Horthur whether he knows of any locations where rutabite may be found. However, Kee-Satt has never been on particularly good terms with the senior miner, so he requests that you approach Horthur first in order to better facilitate the conversation.</target>

He patiently explains that since Twine was originally founded by Ronso and Mystel working in unison, it is important that the two races should not let their differences divide them. When the subject of rutabite is raised, he shares a tale of a mine in the Dragging Tail said to have collapsed over a hundred years ago, where the elusive ore was once found in abundance. Kee-Satt, with renewed determination, asks you to meet him outside of the settlement, from where you will begin the journey to the lost mine.</target>
