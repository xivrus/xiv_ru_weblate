The parts that house them are equally important. We're collecting them for use in our tests, with the aim of eventually building our own from scratch.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="52" approved="yes"><source>52</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZH202_03530_MINER03530_00O_004&lt;tab&gt;Perhaps you could lend us a hand, if you're not too busy. With these old Stoneworks tools, you should be able to open one up and take out the housing components inside.
