Fawning profusely over you and your accomplishments, he begs your aid in finding out what is troubling one Tolas, a member of the Crystarium guard and close companion. Should you be so inclined, accompany the youth to the Ostall Imperative, and lend an ear to the guardsman's troubles.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZH301_03533_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You reunite with Mauwyl at the Ostall Imperative. The two of you make your way to Tolas's post, and are quickly taken aback when the stern-looking guardsman at first reacts to your presence with sudden panic and fear. The man apologizes for the overreaction, and explains that he has been feeling fatigued ever since coming back from a particularly harrowing battle with the sin eaters. Tolas then dashes off abruptly, leaving Mauwyl increasingly concerned about his friend's state of mind. The youth suggests that you split up and inquire with Tolas's fellow guardsmen, that you might glean some insight into what weighs on the man's heart.</target>
