				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKZH104_03528_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Having learned of a possible location for a vein of rutabite from Horthur, Kee-Satt has departed for the Dragging Tail. The inner reaches of the mine are said to be crawling with all manner of vicious cave dwellers, and the young miner is likely to have need of your protection.

Since reopening the tunnel is a task requiring a whole team of miners, he decides instead to pick away at the fallen rubble nearby for pieces of rutabite that might indicate the presence of a vein deeper within. As he sets to work, you will need to keep any aggressive creatures away from him, although the sound of his pickaxe may draw unwanted attention.</target>

The celebrations are cut short by the unwelcome arrival of the Ronso miners who had been harassing Kee-Satt earlier, and to the surprise of none, they resume hurling inane insults. The young Mystel refuses to take the bait, and instead requests their aid in clearing the way to the source of the rutabite. While they initially express reluctance to cooperate, they are nevertheless impressed by his sincerity and agree to join his venture. In the hope that Mystel and Ronso may once again work together for the good of Twine, Kee-Satt leads the way to the Dragging Tail, but not before offering you heartfelt words of appreciation for your loyalty and support.</target>
