Equipped with such knowledge, Yaana would examine her comrades in the light-heavyweight division to determine if they have been afflicted with psychonekrosis. Having received your blessing to do so, she wastes no time in contacting Honey B. Lovely, her senior at the Arcadion.</target>

Beside him stands the Howling Blade, his childhood friend, who informs you that the pair owe the president of the Arcadion a debt of gratitude they can never repay. Carefully reading the air, he takes his leave, allowing Yaana to reveal the dire cost of using feral souls to the Brute Bomber. You are already too late, however, as Neyuni's examination indicates his soul already shows signs of the affliction. The diagnosis is proven true not a moment later when the Brute Bomber suffers from a severe bout of dizziness, a symptom of the disease. Yet in spite of the mounting evidence and Yaana's earnest warnings, he remains in denial. The three of you depart his room with faint hope he will have a change of heart.</target>
