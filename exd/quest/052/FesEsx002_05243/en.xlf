Picturing delighted parasol bearers throughout the city, Nonotta suggests the scope of Jihli's vision has reached far beyond the amphitheatre, as it was perhaps always meant to do. Thrilled that the dream of myriad floating eggs has been fully realized, the pair repay your assistance with an Archon egg parasol of your very own.
