In walks Ruvoll Ja, a Mamook native who left his homeland for Tuliyollal years ago. The Doppro cheerfully suggests that using wivres will solve their problems and sallies forth to convince his fellows, but Gotoll Ja's countenance is troubled as he watches the young man depart. Apparently Ruvoll Ja's affability can overcome his coherence during conversation, so Gotoll Ja bids you help him in his negotiations.</target>
