        <target state="final">TEXT_FESPDX002_05238_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Picot shares with you the reason he first became a singer, describing in bittersweet detail the shows he would perform for his ailing childhood friend. He hopes that by taking his act to the Little Ladies' Day stage, his voice will then rise high enough and loud enough to reach her ears even in Thal's somber halls. To that end, he asks that you accompany him to said stage, and seek out inspiration that will help him finalize the details of his Seneschal Prince costume.
