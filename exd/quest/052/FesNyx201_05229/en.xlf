Speaking with its leader, the uma bugyo, you learn that her assistant, the uma yoriki, is having difficulty handling their mascot. She begs you lend the man your aid, and you set off in the direction of the Drowning Wench to find him.

In light of this, the uma yoriki asks that you take the unicolt in his stead and spread word of the event.</target>
