He offers to guide you to one final vista─one overlooking the entire Moongate Hub. There, he confesses that the resolution of the Final Days left him unmoored from purpose, as it did many other Loporrits, but the scholars of Old Sharlayan inspired him to follow his curious heart. It was this epiphany that gave rise to the Cosmic Exploration Initiative and its headquarters, where a fully functional starship is now in want only of a destination...

The next quest will be available once you have completed 100 stellar missions in Sinus Ardorum. You may undertake missions and other cosmic exploration tasks from your exotablet.</target>
