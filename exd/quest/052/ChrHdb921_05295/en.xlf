The detective's search for the missing Hildibrand has proven unsuccessful, but after encouraging you to retell the tale of your journey thus far, he pounces on the idea of tracking down the starship instead. To that end, you make your way over to the residential sector, hoping to interview older natives of your world who may have witnessed the original crash landing.</target>

Rather than fuss with finding a manual to open this advanced containment unit, however, an explosive egg proffered by Nashu suffices to at last reunite you with the indomitable inspector.

Hildibrand seems none the worse for wear after three decades of hibernation. Hardiboiled marvels at the inspector's still youthful appearance, not to mention his taming of the zombie horde drawn by the commotion, but there appears to be no love lost between the hard-bitten detective and the gentlemanly agent of enquiry. Differences (and similarities) aside, Hardiboiled is nonetheless willing to share the details of the new case he stumbled across within the ominous facility.</target>
