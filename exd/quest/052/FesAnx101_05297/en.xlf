        <target state="final">TEXT_FESANX101_05297_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Making your way through Limsa Lominsa during the Rising, you come upon the wandering minstrel at the Aftcastle. The man seeks inspiration for a new song, and requests your aid in speaking with the locals for their tales. To that end do you head together to the Drowning Wench, where you chance to witness Baderon in conversation with a fiery Miqo'te child named R'tcha. The young one wishes to become an adventurer so that she might leave the city alone, but Baderon turns her down out of concern for her safety. Worried that she might still attempt to sneak out, however, the tavernkeep bids you keep an eye on her, and suggests that you begin by speaking with Klindrael, the Yellowjacket stationed at the Tempest Gate.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
