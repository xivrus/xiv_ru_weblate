        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMG106_05249_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Having spent a fruitful stretch of time learning more of the rroneek and their care, you and Koana are rejoined by Wuk Lamat and Erenville, with whom Koana shares his recent revelations about these hhetso. In turn, they explain that they detected an unusual aetheric signature while investigating the rroneek's former grazing grounds─one that may be indicative of a predator. The Hhetsarro speculate that this may be a fearsome creature known as a “tturuhhetso,” or rroneek reaver. If so, it not only is the probable cause of the rroneek's change in grazing patterns, but also presents an imminent danger to the local herds.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMG106_05249_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Further word of the reaver arrives more swiftly than anyone could have expected, as a Hhetsarro comes sprinting into the camp, shouting that the beast approaches. The rroneek's safety is the first priority of one and all, so you move to assist those currently roaming the plains. Ere long, however, the tturuhhetso itself appears. Koana throws himself between the predator and a threatened rroneek, and you and Wuk Lamat rush to his aid. Though stymied for a time by its adamantine scales, Koana soon finds a way to disrupt the flow of aether that strengthens them, and together, the three of you see the tturuhhetso slain.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMG106_05249_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The defeat of the rroneek reaver brings two revelations. First, Koana realizes that by repurposing its scales, it might be possible to fashion a device to deter the rroneek from approaching any passing locomotives without restricting their freedom. Then, through the tale of a Hhetsarro trader, you learn that it was likely a tturuhhetso attack that saw Koana orphaned as an infant, and that he was not abandoned by his parents as he had believed for his entire life. With this new perspective, the Vow of Reason is at last able to find closure, as well as a newfound appreciation for his biological and adoptive families.</target>
