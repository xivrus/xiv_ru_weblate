Just as the pair resolve to tackle this problem as a family, Wuk Lamat approaches to offer advice. Their situation is a common one, it seems, for she tells them about a group established to help impart the skills required for life outside the dome to returning Turali. Content with having helped her subjects, the Vow of Resolve leaves their table and finally notices you sitting nearby. After a bit of catching up, she mentions that she and Koana have something to discuss with you at the palace. Curious as to what the Dawnservants might want, you agree to attend them.</target>

For personal and political reasons, Wuk Lamat decides to pay her respects as a representative of Tuliyollal and requests that you and your allies come along to keep watch over proceedings.
