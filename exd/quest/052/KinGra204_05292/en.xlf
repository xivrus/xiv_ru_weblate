Metem soon rushes into the room, explaining that the president has granted the vile heat a grudge match with you on the condition that he employs multiple feral souls. Such an act could potentially be lethal, yet the president's word is absolute to the former champion, and so you have no recourse but to face the reckless heel. Once you have seen to your preparations, a chauffeur awaits at the Arcadion to deliver you to the battlefield.</target>

Yaana pleads for him to abandon his plan to inject himself with multiple feral souls, unfortunately to no avail. The chimerical creature which forms before your eyes bears no resemblance to the man who formerly stood before you, and Metem quickly observes this fact by declaring the man-turned-monster the Brute Abombinator. His life hangs in the balance, and if you are to keep your promise to Yaana, you shall need to fight harder than ever before in this vengeful showdown.
