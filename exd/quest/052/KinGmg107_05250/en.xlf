Thus do you set off for the Backroom together─with his charming Cahciua curio in tow.</target>

Though these disturbing revelations would be overwhelming even for an adult, Gulool Ja puts on a brave face, and even thanks present company for helping him to learn the truth of his birth at long last.</target>

Glad are they, then, when their beloved Queen Sphene suddenly appears with a solution: to convert the people into Endless via neo regulators, that they need fear death no longer. Given that you were instrumental in the destruction of the Queen of Reason, you and Wuk Lamat immediately suspect deception, and your doubt only grows when “Sphene” mentions the caveat that, at present, her proposed boon will only be extended to five thousand citizens. Despite Wuk Lamat's protestations, none join you in your skepticism, for the Alexandrians seem to be afflicted with collective amnesia and have no recollection of her death or subsequent funeral...</target>
