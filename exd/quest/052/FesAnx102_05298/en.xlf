Seemingly finding courage in voicing her feelings, she continues resolutely on her way.</target>

The man had been acquainted with R'tcha's parents, however, and he gladly shares what he remembers of them. When the Calamity unleashed a monstrous tidal wave on Vylbrand, the couple had fought desperately to protect their lighthouse. Though they lost their lives in the trying, they saved full many by doing their duty to the last. The knowledge serves to comfort R'tcha, and at Rostnzeh's invitation, you stay the night to hear more tales about her parents. So it is that R'tcha attains closure, and inspired by her parents' bravery, she resolves to become someone who helps others.</target>
