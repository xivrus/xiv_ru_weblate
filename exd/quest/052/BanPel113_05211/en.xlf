        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPEL113_05211_YUBLI_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Unfortunately, we don't have the necessary ingredients to hand. We create the incense using the nectar of a particularly fragrant flower. The only trouble is it grows in a somewhat perilous location─there aren't many we can ask to brave the trip.</target>

Using them, you should be able to harvest the nectar without harming the foliage. Head for Xodune─the plant is known to bloom in the surrounding area.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPEL113_05211_YUBLI_000_022&lt;tab&gt;Thanks to that powerful scent, fiend encounters are down, and customer satisfaction is up! It's also alleviated some of the burden placed on our guides-turned-protectors. Anyway, we soon get through the stuff, so I'll let you know the next time our stocks need replenishing!</target>
