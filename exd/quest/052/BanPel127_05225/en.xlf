        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_YUBLI_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Wawkesa's eatery has been a sound success so far. His approach of tailoring the menu to individual tastes has won him plaudits from visitors, but when supplies run low, he is sometimes unable to furnish guests' requests.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_YUBLI_000_002&lt;tab&gt;I'm loath to trouble you, but I'd have you gather Ihuyka achiote for our resident chef. Three sprigs should yield enough seeds for Wawkesa's cooking. Deliver your harvest to him when you're done!</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPEL127_05225_WAWKESA_000_022&lt;tab&gt;Achiote is just about essential in Xbr'aal cooking. Same goes for the cuisine here in Kozama'uka. A sprinkle or two really elevates a dish. I also use it to add a touch of color to grilled meat and the like. I couldn't do without it, personally!</target>
