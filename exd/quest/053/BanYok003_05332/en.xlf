However, Fahrafahr is uncertain which items were used in the ritual, and asks that you visit Worlar's Echo to speak with a merchant that supplied Dartorgor with provisions. While you do that, she and the other Yok Huy will continue to clear the snow which even now lies thick in the mountain valley.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANYOK003_05332_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You find Kurbulur and the old merchant fondly recalls his trades with Dartorgor. Apparently she eschewed coin and instead bartered with corn and corn seeds grown in the frigid mountains. Recalling that Dartorgor said they were tailored to the tastes of someone or something held as important by their group, Kurbulur surmises that it might have something to do with the Pact. He then asks to accompany you back to Zirgorteh so he might find a way to help Fahrafahr and the others, and together you depart.</target>

Before they come to a definitive answer, one of the workers informs you that they recently uncovered a sepulchre buried in the snow, which may very well be Dartorgor's. However, it seems to be frozen in ice, meaning special tools are required if the stone is to be freed without damage to its inscriptions. Hoping that the answers she seeks are on the sepulchre, Fahrafahr shifts focus and asks you to accompany her to Shelter to begin construction of the tools you require.</target>
