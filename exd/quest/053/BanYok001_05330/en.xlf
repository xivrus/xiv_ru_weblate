        <target state="final">TEXT_BANYOK001_05330_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;A Yok Huy introducing herself as Fahrafahr seeks the aid of a skilled artisan─a need which you conveniently fill. She informs you that the snow spirits living in the nearby mountains have gone berserk, triggering an avalanche that buried a remote location that contained a ceremonial altar. Apparently, performing a ceremony called the Pact at this altar is the only way to quell the rage of the spirits, and Fahrafahr requests your aid in rebuilding it. Before agreeing to the task, you ask to see the extent of the damage, and together you and Fahrafahr go to the mountain pass leading to the site of destruction.

Fahrafahr tells you that she knew of the area and the Pact because of one Dartorgor, a dear friend who was the last of an ancient group of caretakers that kept the snow spirits placated. Dartorgor unfortunately died in a tragic accident, and Fahrafahr states that although there is yet much to learn, she intends to follow in her departed friend's footsteps. You agree to help the young Yok Huy, and for your first task, she asks you to come with her to Worlar's Echo and recruit extra hands while she prepares for the work ahead.</target>
