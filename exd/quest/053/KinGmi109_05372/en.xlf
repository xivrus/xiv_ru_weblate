        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMI109_05372_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You are welcomed by Mahuwsa, who gives a brief account of the chaos which arose from the enthrallment of those wearing neo regulators. She is optimistic for the future, however, thanking you for putting a stop to Calyx and praising Sphene for her uplifting speech. After Mahuwsa leaves to aid the residents of the outskirts, the discussion turns to the subject of recruiting arcane practitioners to assist with the treatments. While your comrades are occupied with this endeavor, Alisaie asks if you might track down Gulool Ja, who is currently making every problem in the kingdom his personal responsibility to solve. Taapu in the driftdowns should be able to point you in his and Erenville's direction.</target>

He then takes you to a spot where he keeps both his father's and Otis's swords, and shares his plans to train with the Landsguard that he might one day be worthy to wield these blades.
