        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMH108_05306_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Your meeting with Milos seems to have lifted Sphene's spirits, and she proposes buying a gift for your friends in the Backroom. However, your shopping is interrupted when an unfamiliar voice uses Alexandria's loudspeakers to inform one and all that neo regulators will no longer be distributed to the populace. The news sparks unease among those nearby, and you decide to make haste and return to the Backroom immediately. Shale greets you with a mixture of concern and relief, but shortly thereafter you are informed by Nostalgia that one of Alexandria's citizens was killed by a rogue mechanical soldier. Before your comrades can process this news, Erenville contacts you via linkpearl, reporting a similar incident in the outskirts. He then breaks contact after saying he will try to lead a group of soldiers away from a nearby settlement. Shale entreats you to go to his aid, and you quickly assemble a group to investigate Erenville's last known location.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMH108_05306_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Your allies are gathered near the aetheryte along with a familiar face: Malachite. He tells you he came to the settlement to retrieve the slain citizen, but when he arrived, the body was nowhere to be found. The usher returns to Solution Nine, and not soon after, you and others present are contacted by others via linkpearl. From G'raha Tia in the city, you learn of an incident caused by malfunctioning machinery─one of many similar instances of Alexandrians being hurt by machines and soldiers, it would seem. Upon hearing of the developing situation, Sphene rushes towards Solution Nine, and Wuk Lamat follows close on her heels. Leaving Erenville in the care of the other Oblivion members, you and your companions head toward the city, uncertain what awaits.

The familiar sounds of combat fill the air as you enter Solution Nine and spy scattered fires in the distance. You come upon Wuk Lamat caring for a wounded citizen, and she bids you go ahead and catch up with Sphene. Fighting your way through rogue soldiers and malfunctioning machines, you find the former queen kneeling before the lifeless body of an Alexandrian. While Sphene is overcome with emotion by this senseless slaughter, she is determined to fight on, and together you go to reunite with your allies in the government sector. There you learn that the machines seem to have ceased their rampage, and none of your companions were injured in the chaos. Alas, the same cannot be said for Alexandria's people, and Sphene asks that you help render aid. You and your allies pledge to do so, and all present make ready to commence rescue and relief efforts, while G'raha Tia bids you return to the Backroom and inform Shale of all that has transpired.</target>
