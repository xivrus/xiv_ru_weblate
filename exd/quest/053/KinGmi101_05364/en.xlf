        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMI101_05364_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The machine rampages have caused much strife and heartache, and while there have since been no new incidents to report, Gulool Ja warns that his renewed control over the now-disarmed soldiers may be temporary at best. Calyx, the mastermind behind the attacks, seems capable of commandeering Alexandria's machines at will. Sphene recalls what she can of the genius engineer from her age, and attempts to make sense of his declared motivations for “improving” mankind. While Preservation did indeed contribute to Alexandria's growth and development in centuries past, Calyx's fixation on creating Endless has led to untold suffering. He must be stopped─but if you would foil his schemes, Shale laments that you will first need to find him. To that end, Geode suggests a patrol to survey the streets and search for information which may help lead you to your elusive enemy.</target>

Bodies had gone missing from several sites where citizens died in both the outskirts and recreation zones, and in their place were found strange piles of dust. As you make plans to investigate further, a panicked Gulool Ja contacts you with a plea for help, fearing that the residential radii have come under attack.

You hasten to the apartment buildings and find hostile mechanical soldiers assaulting the residents. No sooner have you saved one citizen than you hear a commotion coming from Isadora and Milos's quarters. Upon entering, you find the aftermath of Wayakkwe's battle with a murderous drone, but the wounded Oblivion member urges you to tend to Isadora first. Sphene puts her retrained magicks to work, healing the critically injured mother and comforting the distraught Milos. The worst appears to have passed, but Wayakkwe remains visibly shaken...</target>
