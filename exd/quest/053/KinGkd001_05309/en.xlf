He soon fetches the legendary Eorzean explorer, who proceeds to outline his plans for one final voyage─sights firmly set on Shades' Triangle, a fabled and feared stretch of ocean in the Indigo Deep. Convinced that your aid will guarantee the expedition's success, he invites you to join his crew on a journey into the unknown. Having assented, you are to speak with Ofangeim, one of the expedition crew members waiting on the pier.</target>

Listening to his explanation, it is clear that such cautionary tales have had quite the opposite effect on the veteran sailor. Still malms away from your destination, Ketenramm suggests you get to know the crew risking their lives alongside you on this perilous adventure.

Shortly after, the ship lurches violently, seized by some arcane power as blinding light engulfs the vessel. As the white pall dissipates, you find yourselves docked at the island's crumbling stone pier. The ship is unscathed but locked firmly in place─perhaps held by the same force that transported you and the crew to these shores. For his part, Ketenramm is quietly pleased about the prospect of being trapped on the isle, and ventures forth with a grin.
