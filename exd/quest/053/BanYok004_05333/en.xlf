        <target state="final">TEXT_BANYOK004_05333_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Fahrafahr reads Dartorgor's living sepulchre for you, which starts with the story of her ancestors and the first Pact. Apparently the spirits are partial to a corn liquor called kirkahryar, which has been the centerpiece of the ritual for generations. This makes apparent the purpose of the corn Dartorgor used as currency, and Fahrafahr decides to speak with Kurbulur to see how viable it would be to make kirkahryar on the mountain. You follow the eager Yok Huy to the larder.</target>

The stone golem would make the task much easier, but its viability as a tool is yet to be determined. Fahrafahr bids you follow her to the outskirts of Worlar's Echo to check on the progress of the golem's testing.</target>
