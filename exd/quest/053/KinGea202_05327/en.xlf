An admirable mission, but one that Bakool Ja Ja explains is ultimately futile without venturing to the source of electrope─Alexandria. To help further their investigation, Bakool Ja Ja contacts Oblivion, who express a keen interest in meeting Alxaal and Prishe. In fact, they suggest a meeting on the outskirts of Alexandria. To that end, the four of you prepare to set off, first making a stop at Sheshenewezi Springs.</target>
