        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGEA203_05328_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You find Scoria safe and sound. When asked about why she ran off, Scoria explains that her father intends for them to move to Tuliyollal, and the thought of leaving Alexandria upset her. She wants to be a singer, but worries the people of Tural will not like her music. Having seen firsthand the myriad peoples of Tural, Prishe tries to help her see the bigger picture, telling her that being different is what will make her music special. Scoria is heartened by her words, even feeling so bold as to share her music with the three of you. Now that she is safe, her heart put at ease, all that remains is to return to Sheshenewezi Springs and reunite her with her father.</target>
