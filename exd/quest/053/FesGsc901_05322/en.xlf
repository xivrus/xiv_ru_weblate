        <target state="final">TEXT_FESGSC901_05322_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;On Emerald Avenue, you encounter an effusive fellow spreading word of the Gold Saucer festivities. Having caught your attention, he shares news of a rumor regarding the venerated Triple Triad player, King Elmer III. He stops short of sharing any pertinent details, however, instead directing you to speak with Ollier the attendant in Card Square should this tidbit have piqued your interest.

Fearing the deleterious impact on the king's reputation and reverberations among both past and potential challengers, Ollier seeks to discern the source of the rumor and tasks you with gathering information in Wonder Square.</target>

He confesses that he assumed the king's identity in order to feel stronger, a charade that spun wildly out of control. Far from excoriating the misguided fellow, King Elmer shares his own struggles as a Triple Triad player, offering advice on how to improve and ultimately inviting his doppelganger to face him fair and square─not as an impostor, but as an accomplished player in his own right. At any rate, with the false king repentant, the rumor ought not spread further. No doubt Ollier will wish to thank you for your efforts.</target>
