        <target state="final">TEXT_BANYOK002_05331_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With the first step of the Zirgorteh of the Open-armed's restoration complete, Fahrafahr has already moved on to the next. She and the Hands have begun building a workshop wherein Yok Huy masons can craft stone using their traditional methods, but it seems progress has come to halt. Fahrafahr is sparse on the details, but asks you to follow her and meet the stonemason Girzorhor to find out what the problem is.

However, Fahrafahr is determined to make him see reason, as his knowledge is essential to building the workshop. She asks you to accompany her, and together you descend to Worlar's Echo.</target>

You also pitch in to remind him how vital the work being done is, and Girzorhor is impressed by the courage of company both past and present. Seemingly at ease, he agrees to help the Hands of Zirgorteh again, but confesses that he lost some of his tools in his flight from the spirits. Luckily, a capable artisan is close at hand, and Fahrafahr asks you to create tools to replace the lost ones.</target>
