As the tonberry ponders why his slumber went uninterrupted for so many years, a faerie floats forth and shares a curious revelation. She claims that whatever knowledge the Archive once possessed has been sealed away, and more bafflingly, that his present memory is somehow linked to the things you yourself have seen and learned. As the faerie leaves─the group none the wiser as to who summoned her, or indeed her purpose─the Archive notes that she is wreathed in the same aether permeating the isle. Discovering the identity of her master may shed light on how Shades' Triangle came to be. As the mysteries proliferate, Ketenramm is determined to forge on with the expedition, and bids you speak with Jeffroy who has been tasked with establishing a base camp on the isle.</target>
