        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMH106_05304_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;After disembarking the lift and pushing through a sandy area crawling with beasts, the former castle of Alexandria comes into sight. You and your allies approach its timeworn doors, only to be assaulted by mechanized guardians, and during the melee you hear the voice of Calyx beckoning you deeper into the castle, where he intends to further test your combat capabilities. Cutting through more foes, you reach a chamber occupied by an ancient but hostile machine, and after a fierce battle you stand victorious. Shale and Sphene catch up, and together you prepare to search the fortress in earnest.

※In the event that you leave the area, you may return by talking to the lift attendant in the government sector.</target>

The moldering surroundings are soon replaced by virtual overlays recreating the throne of Alexandria in its former glory. At the center of the chamber are Calyx and the simulant, the former stating that he has one last trial with which to test your mettle, before a hulking mass of metal descends onto the arena. The simulant addresses it as Zelenia, who was second-in-command of Alexandria's royal knights. Overcome with rage at this affront, Sphene begs your aid in destroying the ignoble machine, even though it means you will be playing right into Calyx's hands.
