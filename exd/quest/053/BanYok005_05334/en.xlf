She is determined to go forward with the Pact immediately, and honors you with the task of getting a barrel of the libation from the kirkahryar house and placing it on the Breathless Altar.

Relief at this development is short lived, however, as the spirit is quick to condemn Dartorgor and all the other Yok Huy for having the temerity to abandon them through death. The spirits depart before listening to reason, and you turn to Fahrafahr to see how she is handling this new development.</target>
