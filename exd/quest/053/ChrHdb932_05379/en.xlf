The fugitive has now been instructed to “put on a bigger show,” to which end the mastermind will provide him with barrels of ceruleum. When Hildibrand reiterates his opposition to violence ahead of a potential confrontation, Hardiboiled reveals his tragic past as a cautionary tale. He, too, once had an assistant, but she was killed by the Crime King when he lowered his guard in a moment of softness.

However, the fiend carelessly sets itself ablaze instead, and it takes an inspired moment of collaboration between Hildibrand and Hardiboiled to stop the panicked creature from hurtling straight into the explosive fuel. Kemakka then arrives and has his men take the fugitive into custody, but it is revealed that the sheriff is in fact an impostor, with the Crime King, Carnelian, having assumed his likeness. The villain manages to flee the scene─but not before ominously declaring that the commotion has served its purpose...</target>
