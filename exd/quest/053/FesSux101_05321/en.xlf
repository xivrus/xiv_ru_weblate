Promised unparalleled recreation, you sally forth to witness the seaside delights at hand.

Additionally, Lhaminn's Coastguard works tirelessly to ensure the guests' comfort and security, and it is to this group of elite swimmers Haermaga would recruit you. P'obyano has been charged with uniform allocation, so you inquire with her before setting out on your first patrol.</target>

Beaudefoin and R'fhul Tia are both especially pleased with the thoughtful design of the uniforms. When you encounter Hildelana, however, a more pressing matter is raised: one of the water chutes' wooden support beams has begun to splinter beneath the surface. She elects to remain nearby to direct the guests away from it, but this is only a stopgap measure until Haermaga is informed.</target>

Concerned about her design's functionality, she sought to observe it from afar─yet ended up requiring the Coastguard's assistance in the process. Though she laments the trouble she caused, she feels proud to have contributed to the safety of the event. Lhaminn's Coastguard, for its part, has nothing but praise for her work.

Since you have completed your shift, Haermaga makes good on his promise to let you keep the maritime attire, though this gift may naturally lead to another patrol or two around the facility─if only for safety's sake.</target>
