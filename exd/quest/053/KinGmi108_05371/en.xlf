She gives thanks to those who have preserved the spirit of her beloved Alexandria, past and present, and together you reaffirm your commitment to fighting against Calyx's callous designs. The opening in the structure's wall glitters with golden energy, inviting you to venture within and confront the architect of Alexandria's mounting mortal dilemma...

As you persist in refusing to yield the key, however, he proceeds to summon an entity designed for the sole purpose of defeating you. The chamber darkens with an innervating chill, and the fear of inevitable death flowing from Alexandria's enthralled citizens feeds the manifestation of a terrifying primal being. Though the device holding Calyx's memories is tantalizingly close, you must first contend with this horror whose grasp promises naught but eternal darkness.

        <target state="final">TEXT_KINGMI108_05371_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;You strike against the memory bank, only to discover it is shielded by a powerful barrier. As Calyx mocks your efforts, the air grows heavy, the weight of mortal dread once more pressing down upon you. In a dry, academic tone, Calyx explains that the experience of death has only strengthened his creation─that it will rise, again and again, until the lightning aether suffusing his ravaged world is drained to its last spark. However, his promise of enduring memories prompts Sphene to recall the true meaning of those words and the comfort they were meant to offer. With Shale's help, she broadcasts a message of hope across Alexandria, buoying the citizens and interrupting the flow of prayer to the primal. Taking advantage of its momentary weakness, your party divides its efforts, with one half battling the entity, and the other working to bring down the barrier protecting the device. Wuk Lamat and Sphene's combined attack finally shatters the energy shield, while Alisaie delivers the killing blow to your enfeebled enemy. Calyx can only monitor the progress of his memory transfer in silent desperation as you spring into action, your decisive strike causing the memory bank to erupt in a spectacular explosion. In the wake of this destruction, Calyx has winked out of existence, and an exhausted Wuk Lamat collapses to the ground, her promise fulfilled.</target>
