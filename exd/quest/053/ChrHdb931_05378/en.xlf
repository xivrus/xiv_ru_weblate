No sooner did I emerge from a thirty-year slumber than I found myself at the heart of a mystery most diabolical: the Case of the Fiendish Fugitives! A secretive researcher has been imbuing monsters with the souls of criminals, who are then set loose in Alexandria to commit their favored felony. With the cooperation of the surly-if-well-meaning Detective Hardiboiled─whom I feel compelled to reiterate resembles me not in the slightest─we were able to apprehend one such villain, an eyeclops with an eye for larceny. Though the fugitive knew naught of the researcher's grand scheme, it is only a matter of time─and the investigative genius of Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville─ere all is brought before the light of gentlemanly justice!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
Hardiboiled has extracted more data from the storage device recovered from Yuweyawata, identifying a new fugitive-turned-fiend for your crew to pursue. The criminal in question has assumed the form of a cauahealoa, a bipedal wolf, and it is believed that it will be committing acts of wanton vandalism, for which it had earned notoriety as a man. While the fiend is like to avoid densely populated areas, for want of other leads, Hardiboiled suggests calling on one of his trusted sources, a man named Mymond. Setting aside the similarity to a certain information broker in Ul'dah for now, you make your way across the recreation zone to meet with the individual.</target>

From the purveyor of information, you learn that a cauahealoa has been sighted entering yet not emerging from Vanguard. Furthermore, its mannerisms marked it as more man than beast. This is enough to convince Hardiboiled that your target has gone to Shaaloani, and you and companions set off for the barrier's exit.</target>

As the confrontation heats up, Hardiboiled challenges the leader to settle matters the old-fashioned way, and the two subsequently square off for a duel in the middle of town. With his superior experience and skill, Hardiboiled gets the better of his brash young opponent before further dodging a spray of bullets from the remaining ruffians. The commotion draws out Kemakka, who deems Hardiboiled innocent for his part in an unlawful gunfight, but when Hildibrand accidentally ignites one of Nashu's Delights in his presence, the sheriff decides to arrest her as a vandal suspect. As his assistant is led away in shackles, the inspector manages to extricate himself from the ground in time to swear that he will clear her name.</target>
