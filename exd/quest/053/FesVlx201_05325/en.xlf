A plan that has apparently hit a snag in cake production. Emissaries of love were dispatched to assess the situation at the pâtisserie and should be returning ere long. To that end, Astrid and Emilie invite you to meet them at the entrance to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone.</target>
