Before he and his fellow hunters could begin a proper investigation, however, they received an unusual mark bill for a beast they believe to be responsible. Knowing of your exploits in felling Valigarmanda, they can think of no one better to aid them in seeking out this quarry. You agree to assist, and the tracker bids you speak with their equally unusual client, who should be near the tavern in Hhusatahwi.</target>

The self-described “Felyne” entreats your aid in hunting a monster known as Guardian Arkveld, who has been disrupting the ecosystem of Shaaloani. Having agreed to lend your aid, the Felyne explains to you how they and their quarry arrived in these lands. With you now brought up to speed, your fuzzy friend sets off towards the town's exit, clearly expecting you to follow.</target>

Your Felyne friend bids you collect samples to aid in tracking the beast by scent. To that end, they introduce you to their companion: a creature known as a Seikret, possessed of a keen sense of smell. Once it has taken in Arkveld's scent, all that remains is for you to climb onto its back and begin your pursuit.</target>

The beast is largely intact, showing no signs of predation, leading the Felyne to believe it was felled by Guardian Arkveld. Before they can explain further, however, a disturbance in the distance draws your attention. Turning towards the sound, you find that what the stray Felyne colorfully describes as a “turf war” has broken out between Guardian Arkveld and the Serpentlord Ttokrrone. Without delay, you rush to the scene and hurl a dung pod at the two monsters, inciting Ttokrrone to flee. Arkveld appears to then take your measure before making its own departure. Having seen the direction it fled, you and your Felyne companion regroup to plan your next steps.</target>
