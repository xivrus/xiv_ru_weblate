The reason, he explains, is that he was only able to bring essential building tools when moving to Ok' Gundu Nakki. Unable to make paint with their limited resources, Ginu Vanu believes the only option is to steal paint from the Vundu tribe. He implores you to go swiftly and stealthily to procure three pots of dye from the Vundu.</target>
