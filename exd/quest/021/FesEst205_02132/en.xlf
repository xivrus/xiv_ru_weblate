Puzzled as to why there has been no sign of the Archons' gift and noting Jihli's somewhat disappointed expression, she requests that you ask the Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide founder if there were any details of the dream that she forgot to mention.

Though annoyed at first, Jihli has a sudden revelation: the egg hunt in her dream was for a single egg. Excited, she declares that the true hunt has begun, and asks you to help her find the thieving spriggan.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESEST205_02132_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;In Bentbranch Meadows, Keitha confirms that a spriggan passed by, struggling to carry an enormous egg, which he then laid carefully in the stables before taking a long nap and departing the Shroud. Jihli beseeches Keitha to return the egg, explaining the importance of decorating and displaying it for Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide. The head wrangler refuses, however, asserting that chocobo eggs are extremely delicate─a statement which surprises and confuses the two Dreamers. Recalling the unusual size and warmth of that egg, Nonotta realizes her mistake and apologizes. Keitha then invites everyone to witness the hatching for themselves, and afterwards, as the two Dreamers fuss over the newborn baby chocobo, Jihli has another epiphany: the gold-colored feathers of the bird must have been the “golden treasure” of which she dreamt. While not entirely accurate (and lacking the proper audience she envisioned), both Jihli and Nonotta concur that the prophecy has been fulfilled, bringing them one step closer to the Archons' descent. With the Hatching Hour complete, Jihli declares the Archons' message cause to rejoice, and returns to Gridania to continue the celebration.</target>
