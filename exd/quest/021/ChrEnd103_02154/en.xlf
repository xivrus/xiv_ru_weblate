However, due to the revelations regarding Ishgard's history, both the curriculum and the traditional means of assessment are currently being reevaluated. Without a clear path to the Trinity, the students have grown disillusioned and angry, with some lashing out at their peers.</target>

While they acknowledge that the uncertainty regarding the rankings is partially to blame, they posit it is but part of a larger problem─a fundamental crisis of faith. That being said, the headmistress and her administrators are quite concerned that some students may attempt to manipulate the interim evaluation system to their advantage. Therefore, the administration would have you and Briardien remain vigilant for any unscrupulous behavior that they might conduct a fair and equitable assessment of the graduating seniors.</target>

Briardien surmises that it would be prudent to learn more about the students and their aspirations. Gaetelle and Saturnois suggest getting to know the students yourself, as they behave differently in the presence of their instructors. Gaetelle recommends starting with the dormitory prefect, Archombadin de Dzemael.</target>

Theomocent is hopeful that they will be able to find like-minded students to support their cause, while Leigh's attitude is less optimistic. During your observations, you also meet a highborn student surrounded by his female admirers. He introduces himself as Crammevoix de Maintigny, and appears to have done well in his efforts to persuade a fellow seminarian to return. During a conversation between the two about the nobles taking more responsibility in redressing the imbalance, the smiling seminarian mentions she was to pen a treatise─that is, until her primary text, volume eleven of the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Seventy-two Articles of Halonic Polity&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, went missing. Nevertheless, she leaves to gather her things and return to the seminary, prompting Crammevoix to take his leave for a nap. </target>

Though present for the announcement, Crammevoix's name is not among those mentioned, and Archombadin soon makes it clear that the girl he was speaking with, Ulaa, has instead formally withdrawn from the scholasticate. Crammevoix is suspicious of Ulaa's sudden departure, mentioning the dormitory prefect's open disagreement with her views on equality. The quarrel between the highborn students escalates, in which Archombadin utters a biting comment about House Maintigny, prompting Crammevoix to leave. Upon witnessing the feud, Briardien suggests the girl's withdrawal is worthy of further investigation.</target>
