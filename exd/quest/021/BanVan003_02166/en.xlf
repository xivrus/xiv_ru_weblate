The deepening bonds have already borne fruit, and Linu Vali has received word that a Vanu Vanu wearing Gundu colors has been sighted in Vundu territory, attempting to save another of his tribe from abuse at the hands of Vundu youths by shouting “No more violence!” at them. Linu Vali remarks that she had an old friend that often used that phrase to avoid conflict, and surmises that it must be him. She has come up with a plan to rescue him from his oppressors, and asks for your aid. Meet Linu Vali in front of Vundu Ok' Bendu and help her reunite with her erstwhile companion.
