        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN603_02199_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Upon speaking with Linu Vanu, you learn that his recent attempts at soothsaying bear ill portent for the tribe. A gaelicat he released fell promptly from the sky, to be seen no more. Fearing that the Gundu's ancestors look down upon the tribe with disdain, he bids you travel to the Gundu totem at old Ok' Gundu, and place an offering of weeping wildwort. Present this offering along with the sundrop dance to quell their fury. Weeping wildwort can be found growing wild in patches at the Cromlech.</target>
