After mentioning your role in defeating Leviathan, Ramuh, and Shiva, the anthropogeographer subsequently theorizes that you should now be capable of summoning forth new egi. Y'mhitra, jumping excitedly at this realization, presses her colleague for suggestions of suitable locations at which to attempt the rituals. Head to the Singing Shards, and join the researcher in the north of the area.</target>
