Though you are generally loath to look back, it is not impossible that stepping into the past may be of benefit to you in the future.

To think of a marvel so strange or so tall,♪
A steely skinned giant whose veins coursed with steam,♪
In whose bright burnished bosom foul goblins did scheme,♪
A heaven to they who therein did dwell,♪
But one whose mere being made all else a hell.♪</target>

So into his huge hand a hero did stride,♪
And battled through legions to reach his hard heart,♪
Conspiring at last to rend it apart.♪
His core being no more, the giant fell still,♪
Though the goblins remained there to plot further ill...♪</target>
