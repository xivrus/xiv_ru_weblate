				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANVAN503_02195_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;In a bid to foster a spirit of cooperation between the Gundu and the nearby detachment of Ishgardian forces, Linu Vanu has prepared a gift of traditional Vanu Vanu catsfoot chews to present to them as an offer of goodwill. Rather than putting the knights on alert by having a Vanu approach their camp with the gifts, he asks that you deliver these presents to Laniaitte at Camp Cloudtop on the tribe's behalf.</target>
