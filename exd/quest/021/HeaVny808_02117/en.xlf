As he tells it, the process of training a flightless chocobo to take to the heavens involves providing it with experiences that will rouse the instincts of its wild ancestors that lie dormant within. For the first stage of the training, bring your chocobo to the Chocobo Forest and slay Dravanian bee clouds.</target>

For the next phase of the training, your chocobo must feel the high winds that his flying forebears once knew. The chocobo trainer suggests two locations suitable for the task: one in the northeast part of Tailfeather, and one in the northwest of Falcon's Nest in the Coerthas western highlands. As the heights are too precarious for a flightless bird to reach, the chocobo trainer suggests that you take in the winds alone, then convey them to &lt;var 29 EB38 /var&gt; by way of scent.</target>
