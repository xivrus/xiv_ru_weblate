        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN110_02180_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Vanu Vanu are starting to molt, their oldest feathers falling away to make place for fresh new plumage. But the process leaves them looking disheveled and unkempt. This misfortune is easily ameliorated through simple use of a comb─an item the Gundu find themselves distinctly lacking right now. Fortunately, the Zundu are nearby, and are famed for the quality of their combs. Muna Vanu asks that you obtain some for his tribe, but notes that the Zundu will not part with their craftsmanship for free. He suggests you kill wamouracampae and gather their meat for trade. Start by collecting wet straw to draw these cautious creatures from their nests. It can be found some way south of Ok' Gundu Nakki.

Without proper combing, the feathers the Vanu Vanu shed will remain hidden within their plumage for days, causing discomfort and itching, and making them look altogether much more scruffy than is respectable. As such, regular combing is a part of life for them─all the more so during molting season.</target>
