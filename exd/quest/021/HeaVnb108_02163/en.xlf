        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNB108_02163_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;As you and the others debate how best to proceed, Ser Aymeric enters the room in the company of lords Edmont and Artoirel to the delight and relief of all present. Alas, the resulting mood of optimism is soon soured by the arrival of a panicked knight bearing grave tidings: a rebel faction calling themselves the True Brothers of the Faith have seized control of the Vault, and taken the refugees sheltering within hostage. Needless to say, the lord commander cannot bow to the demands of such zealots, leaving him with but one option: an armed assault. Without hesitation, you and your fellow Scions volunteer to help, prompting Lord Artoirel to pledge his support as well.</target>

Fortunately, they are no match for you and your allies, and together you are able to rescue all but one of their captives─a young girl named Maelie, whom you learn was borne off to the upper levels by a priest. You, Ser Aymeric, and Lord Artoirel have no choice but to give chase.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNB108_02163_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You finally corner the priest on the uppermost level of the Vault, and Ser Aymeric demands his immediate surrender. Alas, the man will not hear reason, being convinced beyond all doubt that Ser Aymeric is a traitor to both kin and country. In a final act of defiance, he throws Maelie from the ledge, sending the child tumbling towards the plaza.

Far below, Lucia and Y'shtola can only watch in horror as the screaming figure plummets towards them. But just when all hope seems lost, a great white dragon swoops down to pluck her from the very jaws of death. Vidofnir!

Soon after, you, Ser Aymeric, and Lord Artoirel join the others outside, where Vidofnir is waiting to deliver a warning from Hraesvelgr. It would seem Nidhogg and his brood have flown for skies unknown. When Alphinaud subsequently presses the dragon for answers regarding Estinien, she declares that she can provide none, and bids you farewell. Though her visit was all too brief, Ser Aymeric hopes that it will do much to change the opinions of the common man. Yet Lord Edmont, who does not share in his optimism, implores the young knight to move with greater caution, lest more perish in his headlong rush for change─not least Ser Aymeric himself, whom the count plainly cherishes as a son.</target>

According to her, his aetheric flow has been disrupted in a manner which would theoretically prevent him from wielding all magicks, teleportation included. Though she stresses that this is as yet mere speculation, it would do much to explain why he did not risk seeking out the Scions upon learning that a primal had been summoned. In the absence of proof, however, you have no choice but to remain silent and attend Alphinaud in Fortemps Manor.</target>

It soon becomes clear, however, that this was not Artoirel's only reason for seeking an audience when he reveals that Count Edmont means to step aside, leaving him to take his father's place as the head of House Fortemps. In this way, Count Edmont intends to rid the house of the lingering suspicion that it was complicit in a coup d'état orchestrated by Ser Aymeric. Yet while Lord Artoirel had long dreamed of this day, it would seem that the recent revelations regarding the founding fathers of Ishgard had prompted him to question the value of his birthright─until, that is, he recalled his late brother's words: “A knight lives to serve─to aid those in need.” And so he vows to follow Haurchefant's proud example and labor for the greater good of Ishgard. And should his resolve waver, he hopes that you will show him the way─as a &lt;var 08 E905 ((sister)) ((brother)) /var&gt;.</target>
