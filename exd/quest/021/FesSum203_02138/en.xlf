				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESSUM203_02138_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;It is an unusually hot day in Costa del Sol, and J'nangho is concerned that the Black Ranger will overexert herself if she attempts to complete her regular training regimen. After trying and failing to convince the obstinate Ranger to stay indoors until temperatures drop, she asks that you deliver three cups of rolanberry shaved ice to the lady in black so that she will not succumb to the summer heat.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Taking the first of the cups, she expresses to you her dislike of ice. Upon explaining to her that it is not for the pleasure of eating but rather to counteract the heat from the sun, she hands the cup back to you, proposing the two of you play a game of hide-and-seek, but with a twist. You will give her a head start of twenty seconds to hide. She will continue performing squats as you search for her and, if you find her before she is able to complete the designated number, you win. Should she finish before you find her, she wins. The loser must then eat the shaved ice as punishment.</target>
