He informs you that the main ingredient, haddock, can be purchased from a nearby stall. Once you have prepared the battered fish, bring it to C'zibho Tia before he runs out of food to sell.

It seems that he and Espan have a difference of opinion when it comes to what makes a dish important: Espan is a stickler for the quality of the fish, while C'zibho Tia maintains that the quality matters not once the fish is fried. However, the many guests of the Moonfire Faire do not seem to mind either way, and C'zibho Tia asks you to deliver more servings of battered fish once you prepare them.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM102_02125_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Deliver a serving of battered fish to C'zibho Tia.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM102_02125_CZIBHOTIA_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Ah, so you've weighed your options and decided to help ol' C'zibho Tia, eh?

I'd eat it myself if there weren't so many customers. Espan just doesn't understand the demand─he's likely still fussing over the freshness of the fish.
