Though Lucia understands the importance of her mission, it is plain that the thought of treating with the brothers and sisters of her enemies still sits ill with her. Alphinaud too has struggled to reconcile his preconceptions in the past, particularly in relation to Ysayle, whom he once viewed as a murderous fanatic, but later came to see as a noble, if misguided, soul.

She duly listens as the knight speaks of the Ishgardians' ancient sin, and of the dream that Ysayle held dear, which Ser Aymeric hopes may yet be made reality. Though the dragon's subsequent response is disappointingly noncommittal, you sense that, in her heart of hearts, she harbors the same hope.</target>
