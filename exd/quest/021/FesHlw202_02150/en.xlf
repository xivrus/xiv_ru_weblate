The worried matron nearby explains that the younglings ran out of her sight for only a moment, but have since failed to return. Heed the investigator's advice, and question Hyrstmill inhabitants for any leads as to the children's whereabouts.</target>

With promises of a wonderful costume to celebrate All Saints' Wake, the villain then transforms the youngling into a horrible fiend. The newly transformed youngling flaps happily away, to the delight of the witch's next visitor─the Impresario. Through their clandestine conversation, you discover the Continental Circus's diabolical plan to harvest the fear the children will undoubtedly feel once they learn the truth: their hideous transformations are permanent. With the power siphoned from innocent terror, the Circus means to summon a demonic legion, and visit upon the realm a second Night of Devilry.

As you withdraw from the shadowed meeting place, you are confronted by a pumpkin-headed apparition. Instead of offering you harm, however, she sympathizes with the children's plight, and provides you with the means to dispel the witch's terrible enchantment. Return to the Adventurers' Guild investigator, and report all that has occurred.</target>
