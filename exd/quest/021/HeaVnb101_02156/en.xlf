Fortunately, it would seem that one of the surviving Students of Baldesion is coming to aid you in your efforts. As much as he would like to stay and greet the Sharlayan scholar, Alphinaud─and you─have been summoned for a private audience with Ser Aymeric to discuss an undisclosed matter. Attend the lord commander at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly forthwith.</target>

Some dispute the lord commander's version of events, while many who do accept the truth question the measures taken to stop the archbishop. Still others have turned their ire on the clergy whom they claim were complicit in Thordan's deception. Desperate to secure a lasting peace, Ser Aymeric bids you escort Lucia to Anyx Trine, that she might treat with Vidofnir and thereby reestablish diplomatic relations with Hraesvelgr's brood.</target>
