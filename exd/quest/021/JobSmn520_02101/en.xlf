Her attempt to instruct you, however, is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Captain Dancing Wolf─an Immortal Flames officer who claims to be in pursuit of the dark summoner, Tristan. Though Tristan was apparently consumed by fire at the culmination of your battle, Captain Wolf has witness accounts that place him at the scene of a merchant caravan attack. Unwilling to dismiss the possibility that the dangerous madman yet lives, Y'mhitra requests that you both be allowed to assist in the ongoing investigation. Travel to Camp Drybone in eastern Thanalan, and speak with Dancing Wolf.</target>
