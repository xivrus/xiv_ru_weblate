The ever-emotional youth seeks to restore life to “Gilly,” the helpful guidance node who showed you about in your travels through Azys Lla. To that end, he entreats you to travel to the Fractal Continuum─a museum of Allagan technology housed inside a decommissioned warship─and come back with a new node nacelle, into which Gilly's “heart” might be transferred. Venture to Matter Conduit VI&lt;var 1F /var&gt;VII and access the teleporter there.</target>
