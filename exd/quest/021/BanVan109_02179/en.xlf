				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANVAN109_02179_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The comings and goings of the Vundu tribe are largely unknown to the Gundu. This greatly concerns Muna Vanu. He worries that they secretly plot to attack his people, but without the manpower to observe this threat, he remains unable to adequately appraise the situation. Fortunately, the accomplished knights of Camp Cloudtop keep a close eye on all that transpires around them, and should be well aware of what the Vundu are doing. Fearing they will be uneager to take sides in Vanu Vanu politics, he suggests you speak with the knights on his behalf and find out whether his concerns of Vundu attack are unfounded.
