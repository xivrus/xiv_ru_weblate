        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN004_02167_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Linu Vali can barely contain her excitement when she tells you that a captured Vundu spy has given up information about her brother. According to the spy, Linu Vanu has been moved to a skycage hanging from the Cromlech. Adamant not to miss this long-awaited chance, she rushes off without further explanation. Meet Linu Vali at the Cromlech to aid in the rescue of her brother.

After you explain the situation to him, he eagerly accepts the sanuwa horn his sister gave you and uses it to summon a sanuwa to escape the stuffy skycage. He dismounts to greet his sister as she is being confronted by yet another group of Vundu warriors. The two share a knowing glance before starting a perfectly synced sundrop dance, the intensity of which sends the Vundu scurrying back to their roosts. The two siblings are safe to have their heartfelt reunion at last, and Linu Vali explains everything that has happened thus far with the Gundu refugees. Her brother seems somewhat skeptical as to the intent of the Zundu tribe's newfound generosity, but nonetheless agrees to visit Ok' Zundu and greet Sonu Vanu. Follow the siblings back to Ok' Zundu and take part in the greeting.</target>

Linu Vanu comments that Ok' Zundu has been left relatively untouched by the Vundu, and criticizes the Ok' Zundu chieftain for buying his tribe's safety with tributes while others, namely the Gundu, had their homes destroyed. Linu Vali is quick to silence her brother, explaining to him that if not for the Zundu, their tribe would be in an even worse off position. Her brother is surprised at his sister's boldness, and he apologizes for his actions. Sonu Vanu takes Linu Vanu's affront in stride, saying that he wants only for the two tribes to grow closer. The Gundu siblings depart to Ok' Gundu Nakki. Return with them and speak with Linu Vali upon your arrival.</target>
