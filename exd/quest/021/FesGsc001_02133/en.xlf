Never one to pass up such an alluring opportunity, you agree to Ollier's proposition, but before he can explain further a shrill cry sounds from the Manderville Lounge. The attendant rushes off to lend his aid, and urges you to accompany him.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESGSC001_02133_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;A chilling sight greets your arrival at the Manderville Lounge: an Elezen lying prostrate on the floor, surrounded by shocked onlookers. Z'napha, a Gold Saucer server, explains that the man was suddenly overcome in a violent fit, from which it seems he will not recover. Roland appears, drawn by the distressed scream, and demands an explanation. After Ollier apprises Roland of the situation, he shocks everyone present by concluding that Goncquard, the victim, was likely poisoned. Roland urges a swift call to action, and appoints both you and Ollier as interim inspectors, offering his full support. Ollier wastes no time and immediately deduces the three most likely suspects─Z'napha, Lyell, and Flaurie─suggesting that you start your inquiry by questioning them.</target>
