        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN504_02196_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Muna Vanu has need of a strong, energetic paissa, but due to his responsibilities to the tribe, he has not the time to undertake the drawn-out task of capturing such wily prey himself. Furnishing you with a large sack in which to hold the beast, he bids you travel westward to where these creatures are most plentiful. They can be caught by digging a hole, which the careless creatures will fall into, finding themselves stuck.

Though his tribe owes theirs a great debt, the elderly Vanu cannot bring dishonor on his people by losing the fight. Once properly trained, the spry and stalwart creature you captured should help secure his victory in the upcoming challenge.</target>
