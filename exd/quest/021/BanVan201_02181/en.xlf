Very rich for tilling, very reason why ancestors settle on that spot. If netherling brings ancestors' chosen soil to Ok' Gundu Nakki, Ranu is certain that village grows sweetest lemons in Sea of Clouds!</target>

Wind crystals of Last Step, those touched by fire are also very important for treating barren soil. Might netherling bring those as well? Ranu is very grateful in advance, like dry plains awaiting approaching rainstorm.</target>
