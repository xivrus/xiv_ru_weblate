In response to the question of what motivated the villain's actions, the miner insists that Tristan was after only one thing: crystals.

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSMN540_02102_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;After reexamining various incident reports, Dancing Wolf is convinced that Tristan was behind several other recent attacks that were mistakenly attributed to the Amalj'aa. With every case involving the theft of crystals, Y'mhitra voices the concern of all present: the nefarious madman harbors plans to call forth a primal. If the atrocities of the past are to be averted in the present, then you must take full advantage of Y'mhitra's studies, and master the recovered wisdom of Allag's summoners.

※The next summoner quest will be available from Dancing Wolf upon reaching level 56.</target>
