In response to the question of what motivated the villain's actions, the miner insists that Tristan was after only one thing: crystals.

With every case involving the theft of crystals, Y'mhitra voices the concern of all present: the nefarious madman harbors plans to call forth a primal. If the atrocities of the past are to be averted in the present, then you must take full advantage of Y'mhitra's studies, and master the recovered wisdom of Allag's summoners.
