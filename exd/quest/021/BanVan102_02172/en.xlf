				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANVAN102_02172_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Gundu tribe's stores of firewood dwindle. Should they be exhausted, the tribe will be forced to face the cold winds of the Abalathian nights without so much as a campfire to warm them. Wood is hard to come by in the Sea of Clouds, but the knights of Camp Cloudtop have been happy to trade in the past. Knowing that Vanu delicacies are prized by the troops manning the camp, Muna Vanu plans to prepare traditional Gundu catsfoot chew to trade for kindling. This required catsfoot herb can be found near Ok' Zundu, he tells you, northeast of his tribe's camp.
