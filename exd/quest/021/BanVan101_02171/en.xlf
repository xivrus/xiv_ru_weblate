        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN101_02171_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Muna Vanu has heard troubling reports of Vundu activity at the border of Zundu territory. Unfortunately, his tribe does not have the manpower to respond to these threats. He asks that you patrol the border in his stead, and protect the Gundu from any encroachers you come across. Travel to the border in the northeast and search there for Vundu scouts.
