Rumors tell of Vanu that still inhabit the village, and Linu Vali has a hunch that they may be fellow Gundu in hiding. She asks that you aid her in the search, assuring you that the Vundu likely have lost interest in the area by now. Meet with Linu Vali at the entrance to Ok' Gundu to begin the search for the lost Vanu.

Soon she introduces her companion as Ranu Vali, a botanist renowned among the Gundu. Apparently Ranu Vali fled along with another Gundu by the name of Eenu Vanu, who leapt over the edge of the island in an attempt to escape the Vundu pursuing the pair. Linu Vali, certain that Eenu Vanu survived the fall, asks that you search for him while they keep lookout for any remaining Vundu.
