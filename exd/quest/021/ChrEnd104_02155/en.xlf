He also expresses his concerns about Archombadin and Lebrassoir, and their blatant discrimination of lowborn peers. In their pursuit to prove their virtue, Theomocent and Leigh discuss finding like-minded individuals with whom they could ally, and Crammevoix is mentioned as a possible candidate. As Leigh is unenthusiastic in approaching any of the highborn, Saturnois asks you to accompany Theomocent to the Pillars to find Crammevoix.</target>

Laughing at Theomocent's cluelessness in the situation, the highborn student attempts to brush aside his resolve, and leaves elsewhere with the lady. But Theomocent refuses to give up just yet, and urges you to follow him to Foundation.</target>

Despite his peril, he warns the timid seminarian not to interfere with his house's affairs, explaining that the woman is one of the smallfolk of his lands, who has rightfully come to seek recompense for his father's sins; he assumes he will most likely pay with his life, as his father had. Theomocent emotionally objects, and tries to convince the woman to accept coin instead of committing a sin herself. He then offers to exchange his life until Crammevoix can return, a gesture that the highborn is moved by.</target>
