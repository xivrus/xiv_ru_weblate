Upon inspecting the body of the summoner, however, the flame captain is astonished to discover that the assailant is not Tristan, but Tristan's elder brother, Kahedin. It is then that the Ascian of the Twelfth Chalice appears, lamenting his decision to employ the siblings as pawns. The Paragon proceeds to laud the primal-slaying efforts of the Bringer of Light, before vanishing as abruptly as he had appeared. Return now to the Hall of Flames in Ul'dah, and discuss these revelations with Dancing Wolf.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="6" approved="yes"><source>6</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBSMN560_02103_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;The identity of the black-robed menace has finally been revealed as the long-dead Kahedin─a reanimated puppet of a powerful Ascian. Though Tristan and his brother are now free of the Paragon's manipulations, Dancing Wolf is intent on exacting vengeance on the callous immortal. Y'mhitra counsels caution, warning that the servants of Darkness are not to be lightly challenged. To that end, the researcher then instructs you in yet another secret of ancient Allagan magicks. Continue your efforts to master the art of summoning that you might benefit from the wisdom hidden within the remaining tomestones.
