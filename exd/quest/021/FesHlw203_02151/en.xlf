        <target state="final">TEXT_FESHLW203_02151_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You join the investigator in Bentbranch, and he grimly explains the situation. Though no children have yet been transformed, it will only be a matter of time before they fall prey to the charms─and curses─of the wily imps. Even as the adventurer contemplates a means by which you might shield the younglings from the illusionists' sinister spells, you hear a voice beckoning you hither. Leave the investigator to his desperate deliberations, and search for the owner of the disembodied voice.</target>

Considering the case in Hyrstmill, he muses, it is likely that the missing Miqo'te has already been subjected to a fiendish transformation. Speak with the pumpkin-headed apparition once more, and request another batch of curse-breaking cookies.</target>

She sadly concludes that by the time another batch was baked it would be far too late. It is then that the apparition presents you with another possibility: if you were to burn the witch's broom and sprinkle its ashes over the girl, then the curse would be broken. Look for a fire in which to cast the broom, and then gather its sooty remains.</target>

Meanwhile, the lead conspirators of the Continental Circus begin to suspect that someone has learned the trick of dispelling their transformation magicks. Fearing that their identities will be exposed, they choose to abandon their malefic plot and focus on maintaining their entertainers' masquerade.

The pumpkin-headed apparition heralds you as the savior of All Saints' Wake, and rewards you with a new witch's broom. Ride your new prize to the clouds and beyond as you enjoy the remainder of the festival!</target>
