        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN005_02168_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The relations between the Zundu and Gundu have been strained ever since Linu Vanu's remarks at Ok' Zundu. However, Linu Vali has a plan to invite the Zundu to Ok' Gundu Nakki for a feast, an important gesture of friendship in Vanu Vanu culture. Her responsibility is to prepare fish for the main dish, but she requires a rare seasoning, Abalathian rock salt, which is possessed solely by the Vundu. She will head to Voor Sian Siran with her fishing pole, and she asks you to steal into Ok' Vundu Vana and procure a chunk of the salt from the Vundu stores.

He thanks you for standing by his sister's side during these troubled times, and even though he knows she has grown, he still worries for her safety, asking you to go check on her at Voor Sian Siran.
