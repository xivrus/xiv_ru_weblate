Instead, Bruvagnon introduces himself as the deputy headmaster, before you are interrupted by none other than Consulting Inspector Briardien, his nephew. The good inspector has been summoned to investigate the theft of the new head of the statue of Saint Valeroyant. For old times' sake, Briardien asks Bruvagnon if you can accompany him as his associate in the case. Bruvagnon seems reluctant for you to be “associated” with the scholasticate, but eventually acquiesces. Join Briardien in his search for the student responsible for supervising the statue work.</target>

After being questioned by Briardien, he grows skittish and abruptly takes his leave to search for the missing piece on his own. Judging his conduct to be odd, Briardien concludes that the boy is hiding something. While he conducts his own investigation in the Brume, he asks that you search Saint Valeroyant's Forum in Foundation for anyone suspicious, as he believes the thief may be drawn to the broken statue.</target>

However, Theomocent seems distraught as he ponders the words of his childhood friend. But he is soon inspired by your courage, and resolves to do his part to redeem the teachings of Halone.

Briardien asks after the culprit, but before you can reply, one of the highborn students, Archombadin, interrupts, claiming to have witnessed Theomocent and Leigh conspiring with another lowborn friend to steal the statue piece and return it to curry favor. Leigh denies the accusation, asserting that you were there and can vouch for their innocence, but Bruvagnon dismisses the students, putting an end to the discussion.</target>
