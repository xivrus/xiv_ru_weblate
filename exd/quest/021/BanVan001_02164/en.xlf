Zundu spies have reported unusual amounts of activity from Ok' Vundu Mok, in the heart of Vundu territory. The Zundu chief is anxious as to what this might mean for his tribe, but cannot risk the uneasy truce with the Vundu by sending his own spies. He asks that you make your way to Ok' Vundu Mok to ascertain what is causing the furor.
