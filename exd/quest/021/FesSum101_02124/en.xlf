Help the guild with the faire by reporting to the chaperone P'obyano to hear what it is she requires from you.

A few difficulties are bound to occur during a celebration as exciting as the Moonfire Faire, and right now P'obyano is dealing with unruly pirates, dirty beaches, inquisitive beasts, and hungry customers. Anyone willing to lend their aid can receive Faire tokens as a reward. Choose the tasks most suitable for yourself and ensure that the Moonfire Faire proceeds without a hitch.</target>
