Unfortunately, they have run out of time, for the king and his minions have begun to venture inland. After requesting that you lend the Rangers your strength on the battlefield, the grand chaperone bids you meet them at Hidden Falls so that together you might organize a strategy to defeat the Bombard King before any harm comes to the people.

As you wait for the Red Ranger to arrive, the other two explain they have yet to perfect the Firefall Battle Formation because their missing comrade often overthinks the steps, causing him to fall out of sync. Luckily, the Yellow and Black Rangers believe they may have found a way to combat this problem through meditation, and request that you hold off the Bombards that have appeared on the shores long enough for them to walk him through the process. Participate in the FATE “In Deep Water” and help the Rangers defeat the Bombard King.
