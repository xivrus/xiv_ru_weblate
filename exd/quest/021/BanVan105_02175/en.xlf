Speak with him and find out.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN105_02175_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Luna Vanu has a hunger for chigoes. Unfortunately, these quick and cautious creatures are notoriously difficult to catch. However, he suggests a tried-and-true technique that can bag these bugs. A full-grown sanuwa is capable of creating a gust of wind that can blast a chigoe clean from its nest. A fast hunter, lying in wait, can snatch up the bug while it lies dazed by the attack. Three large, old trees at the Gauntlet are likely to have chigoe nests in them. Luna Vanu will wait beneath these trees while you, on sanuwa-back, blast your quarry from its place of hiding.

※Speak with Luna Vanu in Ok' Gundu Nakki to mount a sanuwa.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN105_02175_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;All goes according to plan. The sanuwa effortlessly throws the chigoe from its nest and within seconds Luna Vanu snaps up his prey. Spurred on by the fruitfulness of your efforts, Luna Vanu is eager to visit two more similar trees on the island and gather the bugs making nest within them.
