        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN106_02176_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You learn that the Gundu's water supplies are precariously close to running out. Muna Vanu is not content to gamble his tribe's fate on waiting for rain, and so asks you to collect spring crystals from Voor Sian Siran to fulfill the need for water. However, since the knights of Camp Cloudtop now gather crystals there, he suggests you seek authorization from the nearby Ishgardians, lest a diplomatic incident result. Travel to the Rosehouse and convince Lady Laniaitte to let you harvest these crystals.

In fact, she finds it odd that they even feel they need permission. Collect three spring crystals from Voor Sian Siran, then return to Muna Vanu and let him know that the Rose Knights bear his people no ill will.</target>

But by speaking to the Ishgardians on their behalf, you may have paved the way to further advancements on this front.</target>
