Muna Vanu is not content to gamble his tribe's fate on waiting for rain, and so asks you to collect spring crystals from Voor Sian Siran to fulfill the need for water. However, since the knights of Camp Cloudtop now gather crystals there, he suggests you seek authorization from the nearby Ishgardians, lest a diplomatic incident result. Travel to the Rosehouse and convince Lady Laniaitte to let you harvest these crystals.
