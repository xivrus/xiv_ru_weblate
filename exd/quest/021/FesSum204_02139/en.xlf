        <target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM204_02139_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;J'nangho tells you of how the Yellow Ranger has perfected a new and deadly attack and he swears its potency is such that it can easily take down any Bombards that have the misfortune to be on the receiving end. The problem? He has yet to test it out on actual Bombards. Requesting that you first weaken the voidsent beasts and then capture them using flame-resistant nets, J'nangho would then like you to release them in the general vicinity of the proud Ranger, so that both you and he can gauge just how effective his attack truly is.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
