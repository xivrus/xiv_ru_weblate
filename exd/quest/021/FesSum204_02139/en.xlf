The problem? He has yet to test it out on actual Bombards. Requesting that you first weaken the voidsent beasts and then capture them using flame-resistant nets, J'nangho would then like you to release them in the general vicinity of the proud Ranger, so that both you and he can gauge just how effective his attack truly is.
