"","TEXT_BANVAN110_02180_SEQ_01<tab>The Vanu Vanu are starting to molt, their oldest feathers falling away to make place for fresh new plumage. But the process leaves them looking disheveled and unkempt. This misfortune is easily ameliorated through simple use of a comb─an item the Gundu find themselves distinctly lacking right now. Fortunately, the Zundu are nearby, and are famed for the quality of their combs. Muna Vanu asks that you obtain some for his tribe, but notes that the Zundu will not part with their craftsmanship for free. He suggests you kill wamouracampae and gather their meat for trade. Start by collecting wet straw to draw these cautious creatures from their nests.
