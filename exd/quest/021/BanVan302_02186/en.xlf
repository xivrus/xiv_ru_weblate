        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN302_02186_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Ginu Vanu feels that his work so far is too plain. He insists that Ok' Gundu Nakki needs something unique to set it apart from other settlements, and he has a plan to make it happen. For his idea to work, however, he needs special stones taken from the living masses of rock known as groundsreapers. He asks that you travel to the eastern region of the Blue Window and slay them for building material.</target>

As he tells it, the groundsreapers, birthed from the soil of islands, sustain themselves using rain and other rocks for sustenance. With building blocks that can essentially feed on bad weather, Ginu Vanu is all but certain the next hut he builds will be the envy of all Vanu villages.</target>
