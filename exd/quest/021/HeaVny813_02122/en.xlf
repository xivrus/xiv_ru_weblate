For more information about the Clan Hunt, or to exchange Centurio Seals for exclusive items, speak with Ardolain in the Forgotten Knight. Otherwise, you are free to risk life and limb hunting down the most malicious monsters in the frozen north and make a name for yourself as an elite mark hunter.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_ARDOLAIN_100_000&lt;tab&gt;I've had word from Ser Leaudaste, the master of Clan Centurio. Seems he's been keeping half an eye on your progress, and he reckons you're just about ready to spread your wings as a fully fledged elite mark hunter.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_ARDOLAIN_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Ser Leaudaste was born into a noble family, but he left all that behind to head out hunting, tracking down the fiercest foes and destroying them for the good of the realm. Folk call him the original hunter-scholar. Being recognized by a feller like that ain't nothing to be sniffed at.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNY813_02122_ARDOLAIN_000_002&lt;tab&gt;Don't be letting it get to your head, though. These elite marks are on a whole 'nother level to aught you've hunted before, and charging in willy-nilly's a sure way to meet your maker. We give them ranks based on how deadly they are, just like the Grand Companies do.</target>

You're free to take whichever bill you choose, but make sure you know what you're doing before you head out hunting. Every one of these beasts is a nightmare incarnate!</target>

It's always a good idea to ask your fellow Clansmen about a mark before you head out hunting─as they say, knowledge is power, and power's what you'll need to get the better of these beasts.</target>
