Theorizing that the lower-ranked Paragon is unable to possess a living being, the researcher suggests luring the villain to an unpopulated area and destroying him for good with a devastating coup de grâce. First, however, you will need to acquire a certain forbidden tome, and study the method by which the power of a trance can be unleashed in one mighty blast. Travel to the Great Gubal Library in the Dravanian hinterlands, and rendezvous with your companions.</target>

The servants of Lahabrea pronounce your demise, and furious battle is joined. Following a murderous exchange of arcane energies, you at last stand victorious over the kneeling form of your foe. The humbled Paragon once more attempts to flee, but you focus the energy of your trance and obliterate the villain with a searing flare of destructive power. Speak with Dancing Wolf, and share this triumph with your companions.</target>
