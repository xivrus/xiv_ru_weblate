Linu Vanu seems insistent that all Gundu perfect this dance─a dance you yourself have mastered. Speak with him and see what you can do to help.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN601_02197_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Linu Vanu explains that the sundrop dance acts as a show of force, through which the Gundu keep the Vundu intimidated, securing their independence. But the elders grow older, and the youths that stand up to take their place fail to carry out the dance with the same strength and energy. Your performance, however, is an exemplar of all that the sundrop dance represents. Linu Vanu asks that you find the Gundu youths that are practicing at Hengr's Crucible. Show them the marvel of a well-executed sundrop dance, and ignite the spark of passion in them.</target>

He tells you that, since the Gundu have so few warriors compared to the Vundu, they cannot hope to win a direct confrontation. Their only hope is to avoid all-out war by intimidating the enemy with their fearsome sundrop dance. Thanks to you, it seems this strategy remains viable.</target>
