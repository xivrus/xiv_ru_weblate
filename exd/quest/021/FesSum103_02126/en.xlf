        <target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM103_02126_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Espan is a man of refined tastes and believes that the attendees of this year's Moonfire Faire deserve battered fish made from only the freshest haddock on offer. However, due to pirate-related troubles, the Adventurers' Guild cannot spare any hands for fishing. He judges you as an adventurer of taste and skill with a fishing rod, and asks that you board the Rhotano privateer to catch the fish.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
