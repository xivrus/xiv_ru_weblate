The mirthful Miqo'te dreamt of a scene of revelry with Eorzeans from all over gathering in Gridania to participate in an egg hunt and other festivities. Although the dream grew too bright to see it herself, she recalls with confidence that at the height of the celebration, the so-called Hatching Hour, a chosen egg cracked to reveal a gold treasure. Believing this to be a message sent from the heavens to herald the Archons' forthcoming descent, Jihli asks you to help her recreate the scene in her dream, promising to share the prophesized wealth with you should you succeed. Speak to Nonotta to learn how you can participate.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended.
