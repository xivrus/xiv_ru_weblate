Never one to offer empty words of comfort, Y'shtola states that all the rumors are true, before steering Krile into the hermit's abode. Follow and hope that the legendary scholar is in an agreeable mood.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_HEAVNB104_02159_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;While conversing with Matoya, Krile reveals not only that she possesses the Echo, but that she has availed herself of the blessing of Light's protection, finally solving the mystery of her preservation during the attack on the Isle of Val. She further explains that with the aid of Matoya's Crystal Eye, she can use her unique manifestation of the Echo to locate and trace the lingering aetheric essence of Thancred. Having taken a liking to the girl, Matoya consents to Krile's plan, which the young scholar wastes no time carrying out. In a trance, she declares that Thancred emerged from the Lifestream near the base of Sohm Al─a wilderness which the hunters of Tailfeather know only too well. Begin your search for the bard there.</target>

Krile, however, has a different tale to share─one of a Vath trader who came to Tailfeather in search of garments fit for a “man of refinement.” The account prompts Y'shtola to question why Thancred would send a Vath in his stead, in response to which Alphinaud loudly recalls how she was naked as her nameday when she returned from the Lifestream. Krile quickly interjects that your next course of action should be to question the Vath, sparing Alphinaud Y'shtola's scorn...for a time.</target>
