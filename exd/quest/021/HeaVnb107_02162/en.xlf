Alphinaud, Y'shtola, and Tataru will focus their efforts on Foundation and the Brume, while you, Thancred, and Hilda will begin by questioning the residents of the Pillars─starting with one Lord Emmanellain de Fortemps, who is a notorious gossip.</target>

No closer to identifying the arsonists, Thancred and Hilda resolve to inspect the locations where the fires were set while you question the refugees on the off chance that one knows something of value.</target>

Your conversation is then interrupted by Lord Artoirel, who has come on his father's behalf to deliver a special salve for Ser Aymeric. As Alphinaud watches him leave, he observes that the young nobleman is not in the best of spirits. To this, Lucia responds that given the rumors circulating about his father and the untimely passing of his half-brother, it would be strange if he were otherwise. Truly, none can deny that House Fortemps has known much tragedy of late...</target>
