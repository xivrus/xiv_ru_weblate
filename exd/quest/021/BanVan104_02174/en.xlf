        <target state="final">TEXT_BANVAN104_02174_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Ecstatic that his tribe is no longer faced with the grim threat of starvation, Muna Vanu explains the reasons for their lack of food and the Vundu's abundance of it. Now that the Gundu have been forced from the verdant land they once called home, they have nowhere to catch food, while the Vundu hunt and gather at their leisure. With only so much food to go around, and all of it in Vundu larders, the Gundu may have to help themselves to their enemy's supplies for the time being.</target>
