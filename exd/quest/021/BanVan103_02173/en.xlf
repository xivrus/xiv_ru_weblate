				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANVAN103_02173_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Endymions have made a home for themselves in Ok' Zundu, and Muna Vanu bids you remove their nests. The perilous task of dislodging them from high atop the rooftops is made easier and safer by using a sanuwa, a creature capable of creating great gusts of wind that can blast away these aeries of mud and branches as though they were tiny affairs made of mere twig and down. Luna Vanu will have prepared such a beast for you to use in this endeavor─you need only say the word.
