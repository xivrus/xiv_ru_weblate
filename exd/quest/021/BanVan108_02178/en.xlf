				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANVAN108_02178_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;A band of lawless Vundu youths have been carousing in the former Gundu village, and Muna Vanu is loath to overlook so disrespectful a display. Bringing the full force of your power against mere children would be a crime, so the wise Gundu suggests a different approach─to buffet them with humiliating blasts of wind from a sanuwa. Luna Vanu will be able to provide you with a beast suitable for this task.
