				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANVAN301_02185_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Ginu Vanu explains that the construction materials available are not conducive to expedient work. Good, steel nails, like those used by the Rose Knights, would help him finish his work much more quickly. To acquire said nails, he plans to offer them meat from tsanahales in exchange. This meat is at its most delicious─and valuable─immediately after being butchered, so you will need to slay the beasts yourself. Ginu Vanu recommends using wamoura, found on an island to the south, as bait to draw them out.</target>
