        <target state="final">TEXT_FESEST203_02130_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The cultured collector tells you that the enormous benediction egg rolling throughout the quarters of Old Gridania is actually an enchantment of sylphic design. Although it appears practically unblemished despite the speed at which it plunges through the crowd, the collector bids you break off a piece of its shell by rubbing a magicked powder onto it. Chase after the egg fit for a king. 

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

It has been enchanted by our friends the sylphs for this very occasion; though it rolls over root, stone, and man, there is not a single scratch upon it!</target>

I will give you magicked powder that, when thoroughly rubbed onto a spot of the egg, will weaken its shell.
