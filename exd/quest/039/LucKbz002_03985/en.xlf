She asks that you consider entrusting said crystals to her, that they might remain in the world those heroes fought so desperately to protect. As this is not a decision to be made lightly, you resolve to seek the input of their spiritual successors─the bounty hunters who helped to defeat the Cardinal Virtues─before committing.</target>

Though they are understandably surprised to hear that the erstwhile Shadowkeeper is nearby pouring ale, all agree that what remains of the First's Warriors of Light should remain in Norvrandt─and proceed to get astoundingly drunk. In the aftermath, you follow through on their sentiments by turning over the crystals to Cyella, who is moved to find that her former companions considered her a friend to the end, one and all.</target>
