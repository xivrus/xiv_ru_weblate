As the young nobleman tells it, his newest goal is to transform the district into a new hub of trade befitting this new age in which Ishgard has opened itself to the world. To that end, he seeks to visit the three nations in hopes of enticing prominent merchants and traders to enter into a mutually profitable business partnership. No sooner has he asked for your escort than you are joined by none other than Count Charlemend de Durendaire, who imperiously insists that he join you on your expedition.
