As the young nobleman tells it, his newest goal is to transform the district into a new hub of trade befitting this new age in which Ishgard has opened itself to the world. To that end, he seeks to visit the three nations in hopes of enticing prominent merchants and traders to enter into a mutually profitable business partnership. No sooner has he asked for your escort than you are joined by none other than Count Charlemend de Durendaire, who imperiously insists that he join you on your expedition. Apprehensive but cautiously optimistic as to what lies ahead, you set off for the Carline Canopy in Gridania to join Francel and the count.</target>

No sooner have you greeted your companions than does the Count de Durendaire rush off to engage the local populace, confident that the prestige and influence of his great house will suffice to make the trade negotiations a swift success. Lord Francel, for his part, is skeptical of this approach, and the two of you resolve to pursue the count, lest he unintentionally sabotage the mission at hand.</target>

Fearing the consequences if the Count de Durendaire presses on with his heavy-handed approach, Lord Francel calmly and diplomatically suggests that the three of you regroup and try your luck at one of the many artisan guilds for which the forest city-state is known, a proposal to which Lord Charlemend grudgingly agrees.</target>

The young man instantly recognizes Lord Francel, and─after sharing a moment's reminiscence about the beloved, departed Lord Haurchefant─eagerly offers to aid your cause by introducing you to his employer, Maisenta of the prestigious Black Rabbit Traders. Overjoyed at this turn of events, Lord Francel thanks the former swordsman, and prepares to welcome his potential new trading partner as the Count de Durendaire grumbles and grouses beside you.</target>

Offering a verbal agreement to prepare a shipment of wares to grace the Firmament's markets, she takes her leave to begin the necessary preparations. Encouraged by your success in Gridania, Lord Francel is eager to move on to your next destination. The Count de Durendaire, on the other hand, appears keen to prove that this was but a case of novice's luck...</target>
