				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBAOZ602_03989_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Martyn gives you a hearty welcome, and quickly fills you in on the latest guild news. Soon after, one of his disciples, P'yandih, arrives to undertake a test of her abilities, but Martyn's teaching schedule is thrown into disarray by the sudden appearance of Royse. It seems the Celestium's manager is hosting distinguished visitors from the Far East, and requires the Great Azuro─or one of his incarnations─to put on an impressive show for these potential investors. Finding himself otherwise engaged, Martyn imposes upon you to administer P'yandih's exam. All you need to do, he claims, is oversee the young mage's battle with some tentacled horror─with said horror patiently awaiting your coming in central Thanalan.</target>

Satisfied with her progress and wondering if Martyn might be finished with his exhibition match, the two of you turn back towards Ul'dah.</target>

※The next blue mage quest will be available from P'yandih upon reaching level 63 and learning Basic Instinct.</target>
