Lord Charlemend, too, is anxious to move on, convinced that the cultured upper crust types of the sultanate will be more receptive to his approach than the common merchants of Gridania. You promise to reconvene with your companions at the Ruby Road Exchange and offer what aid you can.</target>

Fearing that the stodgy aristocrat has truly bitten off more than he can chew this time, you are relieved when your acquaintance Lord Emmanellain arrives on the scene, skillfully defusing a potentially problematic situation with his silver tongue. After a brief exchange, the free-spirited nobleman offers to arrange a partnership with a prominent merchant─in exchange for a verbal promise that a good word will be put in for him with his beloved Lady Laniaitte─and his dutiful manservant Honoroit promises to see that the deal is brought to completion. Breathing a sigh of relief at having avoided a complete breakdown of negotiations, you set off to relay the good news to Lord Francel.</target>
