Reports from the Fishermen's Guild tell of a gargantuan man-eating shark terrorizing the shores of Costa del Sol, and the hosts of the festivities are desperately looking for help to drive off this threat before anyone comes to harm. Speak to Haermaga in Costa del Sol to volunteer your aid to this beleaguered celebration.

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESSUM601_03966_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Haermaga greets you heartily, eager to have any assistance he can get. He informs you that Gegeruju has begun assembling a special team of researchers to combat this maritime threat, and asks you to stand watch with him while awaiting their arrival. No sooner do you begin scanning the horizon than the terrible shark emerges from the waters, sending revelers running for their lives. As you prepare for a fight, however, a voice urges you to stand down, and you turn to see a woman who introduces herself as Thracie, leader of the self-styled Bombardiers. Their objective is to use the kobolds' expertise in all matters explosive to blast the shark back into the depths whence it came. To do so, they have constructed an artificial Bombard, the very threat which spurred the inception of the Moonfire Faire. Although Haermaga is skeptical of their methods, it is the best plan available, so you agree to aid the Bombardiers in their mission. Speak with Thracie to hear the particulars.</target>

Thracie ponders how such a massive and feral creature wound up on the shores of Costa del Sol, and just as she is about to drop the subject, she is taken aback by the sudden appearance of a miniature monster at her heels. Thracie's scream echoes down the beaches, followed soon after by Captain Foerzagyl of the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Endeavor&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. He was looking for the tiny shark, who has been his steadfast companion ever since it was plucked from the ocean during a fishing voyage. You quickly dismiss any connection between the two creatures as Foerzagyl hurries back to his ship, and decide to content yourself with a job well done, and a summer well rescued.</target>
