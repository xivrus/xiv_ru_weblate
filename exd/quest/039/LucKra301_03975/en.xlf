There will, however, be ample time for further discussion aboard the skyslipper, which is ready and waiting at the Derrick.</target>

It appears that during her time in the Crystarium, she has learned not only to control this complex, shoe-like craft, but she has also gained a degree of consideration for others. You had best hop aboard before she changes her mind.</target>

Sadly, this buoyant mood is short-lived as you are met with an unwelcome sight when you reach your destination. The once-lush and verdant plant life is drained of color and vitality, much to your dismay. The crystal that towers about the camp has taken on an ominous, white glow, indicating that the balance between Darkness and Light has shifted in favor of the latter. Suddenly, Gaia clutches her head, and it becomes all too clear that her ordeal is far from over.</target>
