Ryne and Gaia then make a timely appearance and regale you with tales of their activities in the Crystarium, which range from fairly constructive to...eating biscuits. There will, however, be ample time for further discussion aboard the skyslipper, which is ready and waiting at the Derrick.</target>

Sadly, this buoyant mood is short-lived as you are met with an unwelcome sight when you reach your destination. The once-lush and verdant plant life is drained of color and vitality, much to your dismay. The crystal that towers about the camp has taken on an ominous, white glow, indicating that the balance between Darkness and Light has shifted in favor of the latter. Suddenly, Gaia clutches her head, and it becomes all too clear that her ordeal is far from over.</target>
