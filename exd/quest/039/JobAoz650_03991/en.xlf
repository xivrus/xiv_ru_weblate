Actually, he would feel far more confident if he could somehow reclaim the costume that Gyodo stole and sold off. He invites you along to stalk the back alleys of Kogane Dori, and flush out the unscrupulous Namazu.</target>

It is Nutiba Buntiba. He mournfully admits to being Bluehood, and confesses his part in stealing the soul crystals and organizing the festival. Unwilling─and seemingly unable─to explain his actions, he nevertheless seeks to make some small amends by putting the full set of the Great Azuro's costume in your hands. Nutiba bids you deliver the outfit to Martyn, who awaits you outside the castle gates near the Ijin District.</target>
