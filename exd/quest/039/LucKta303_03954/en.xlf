        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKTA303_03954_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You consult with Konogg, who mentions that he would like to check on the other villagers─a perfectly reasonable idea, given that if they are fine, they will have ale, and if not, they will need help. Even Anogg agrees to go, but before any of you can move a single step, raucous noise emanates from outside the door.</target>

Due to eyewitness accounts of a not entirely inaccurate but nevertheless incomplete nature, it seems that many have concluded Anogg and Konogg to be the source of the chaos. With tempers running high, it is impossible for the siblings to get a word in edgeways about their motivations or the dangers that remain, and thus Konogg begs you to explain the situation to the village elder in their stead.</target>

Perhaps if you assist him in reconciling the villagers' differing perspectives, he will be more inclined to listen to your side of the story.</target>

However, before he can announce said results to the people at large, he is interrupted by Anogg─who is in turn interrupted by 2B, whose sudden and menacing appearance sends the other dwarves fleeing in terror. Though she ostensibly merely found the argument over blame to be as pointless as it in fact was, Konogg has a sneaking suspicion that she intervened out of concern for the twins' welfare.</target>

She dismisses this as of no import, and without further ado hoists 9S over her shoulder and leaves─presumably to continue her campaign against the machines.
