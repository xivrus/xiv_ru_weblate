A boy with a bee in his bonnet.
He had agreed to a bet
He would come to regret,
Unless, of course, he actually won it.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The wager with Chief Xamott has prompted several Tholls to return to Tomra for fear of banishment in the event that Ronitt fails. He must produce five Rolling Tankards by the designated day, which is becoming increasingly unlikely as his workforce diminishes. He decides to take a stroll, ostensibly to clear his head, but through a rather obvious attempt at reverse psychology, he strongly implies that he wants you to follow him.

He reveals that he is finding the burden of responsibility too much to bear, and turns to you for advice. Your words of wisdom soon lift his spirits, but it is the surprise arrival of Regitt, Karutt, and Ronitt's dwarven relations protocol automaton, the Megasonic Frogboy, that make the biggest difference. While his friends offer their support, the Frogboy provides Ronitt with a hint as to how they might turn their fortunes around.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANDWA005_03900_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;After a flurry of activity, Ronitt's latest creation is completed. He has incorporated his existing automaton technology into a mechanized factory, which he claims will increase the speed at which the remaining tanks may be produced. While this does raise the question of how exactly this was a more effective use of time and resources than simply repeating the steps used to create the prototype, it seems the general consensus is to go along with Ronitt's schemes, regardless of how absurd they may be.

The newly constructed automated factory whirs into life and the tanks approach completion. However, the day of reckoning has arrived, and it appears that Ronitt's efforts may have been too little, too late. Ozogg believes there is no other option but to delay the arrival of Chief Xamott to allow Ronitt time to finish his work before final judgment can be passed.</target>

She tasks you with positioning the barrels, and while it is unclear why she needs your cooperation in the first place, time is of the essence, so you decide not to argue.</target>

Presumably, he has come expecting to see Ronitt fail the challenge and to admonish Ozogg for her involvement. Instead, they find themselves distracted by the allure of a powerful ale, prompting them to collapse into a drunken stupor. Though the limits of their dwarven constitution are sorely tested, they eventually awaken, and Ronitt is still nowhere to be seen. Xamott is ready to declare the wager has come to an end when Ronitt and his column of five tanks trundle onto the scene, much to the relief of you and Ozogg. Xamott congratulates Ronitt on passing the test, which he then uses as an opportunity to regale those in attendance with the tale of the great Watts.

It seems that the Tholl and Gogg were once part of the same tribe, and it was disputes over how best to use Watts's automata that caused the schism between them. His remaining designs were locked away, only for Ronitt to open the safe generations later using a coin given to him as a child by none other than Ozogg. This coming together of Tholl and Gogg may very well mark a turning point in the history of the two tribes, though only time will tell. Xamott and Glagg bid their farewells while the rest of you return to the Anvil.</target>
