        <target state="final">TEXT_FESHLW701_03995_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Adventurers' Guild investigator relates to you his plight: as All Saints' Eve approaches, a shifty figure known as the Scarlet Snout has been making the rounds about Gridania, unsettling the local populace. Sadly, the investigator's best efforts have turned up little in the way of leads as to what this individual is up to. At his behest, you agree to aid him in his quest by inquiring among the locals in hopes of learning more about this red-nosed ruffian.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
