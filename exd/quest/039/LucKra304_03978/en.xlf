The Ascian intends to shape these memories into an adversary created solely to destroy you and Ryne. Though it is impossible to predict the form your foe will take, you grit your teeth and prepare for battle.

As your foe moves to strike you down, Gaia's consciousness intervenes, forestalling the attack. This, however, only serves to enrage the Ascian, who begins to erase Gaia's memories one by one. Your adversary then proceeds to draw vast amounts of aether into Eden in order to create a utopia in which time has no meaning. The Ascian then disappears, though neither you nor Ryne intend to abandon Gaia to her fate. Ryne exerts her control over Eden, disrupting the aetherial flow, granting you an opportunity to give chase.
