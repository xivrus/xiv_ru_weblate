        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKTA401_03998_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Konogg, still inconsolable following the disappearance of his sister Anogg, explains that little has changed in Komra since last you spoke. This indeed seems to be the case, as several of the same villagers who previously spoke out against the twins soon arrive to further express their disgruntlement. Among them is a man you have not seen before, who hastens to chastise Konogg for his culpability in the tragedy that led to his wife's severe injury. Your dwarven friend is visibly shaken, and dissolves into tears on the spot.</target>

He is determined to find a way to help the man and his wife, but fears that he will have little luck determining what might improve their situation while the other villagers are so ill-disposed toward civil conversation with him. Naturally, you volunteer to make inquiries in his stead.</target>
