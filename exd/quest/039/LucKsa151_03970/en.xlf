        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKSA151_03970_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You consult Zlatan about the types of memories that would be ideal for strengthening your weapon's inscription. Considering the blades of Gunnhildr were originally forged in Bozja, he believes memories of battle from the southern front are a matter of course. Then, to add a personal touch, he suggests memories of battle from a memorable location from your past would be ideal. As for how many memories, he believes the task at hand calls for three varieties of memory, and twenty of each.

※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.
※Memories of the dying can be obtained in the field fighting at the southern front, or from specific FATEs in the following locations:
Coerthas Western Highlands, the Dravanian Forelands, the Dravanian Hinterlands, the Churning Mists, the Sea of Clouds, or Azys Lla.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKSA151_03970_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;With the requisite memories in hand, you return to Gangos and hand them over to Gerolt, who wastes no time setting to work filling the encampment with the clangor of his hammer. The ringing soon halts, and he presents you with a newly forged weapon. As you take it into hand, the newfound power surging through it is unmistakable. Zlatan can only look on in wonder at Gerolt's work, but their revelry comes to an end when Rowena appears. She explains that the idea to use memories to enhance the Resistance weapons was hers. What's more, one of the materials needed to accomplish this─a rather expensive one, she claims─was purchased from her stores on the behalf of the Resistance. It remains to be seen what she will ask for in return for her wares, but for now you take satisfaction in knowing you are better armed for the fight against the Empire.</target>
