Reflecting on the importance of culture, the arts, and entertainment and the role these all play in sustaining a living, breathing city, he invites you on a tour of the newly opened Risensong Quarter─a district which he hopes will serve precisely that role for the Firmament as a whole. Should you be so inclined as to take him up on his offer, join him at Ser Vaindreau's Grace.</target>

Here, as your good friend tells it, any and all people in Ishgard may seek succor and reprieve from their wounds and ailments regardless of their status or station. Your conversation is interrupted by an artist whom you recognize as something of a celebrity in these parts. Gushing with adoration, he thanks you profusely for your role in ending the war, which allowed him to put down his blade in favor of the brush and palette he had dreamed of taking in hand for so long. Thanking him for the sentiment, you make ready to join Francel at the next destination on your excursion─the bathhouses of Snowsoak Springs. </target>

Though pleased at a job well done, they lament that the completion of the reconstruction effort means that they must now go separate ways with their beloved chief who was a stern-yet-gentle guiding hand throughout the long process. Speaking from your own experience traveling the realm, you assure them that farewell need not be forever, a sentiment which heartens them somewhat. Your work here done, you set off to rejoin Francel where you started, in the center of the Risensong Quarter.</target>
