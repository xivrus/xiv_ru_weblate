Lord Charlemend, still deeply bitter about the disappearance of his son at sea some twenty years ago, is not keen to pay a visit to a den of pirates, but swallows his pride in hopes of avenging his loss by securing a trade agreement that will bring prosperity to his house and homeland alike. With a mixture of trepidation and anticipation, you set off for Limsa's Bulwark Hall to reunite with your companions.</target>

Francel, however, cannot help but remark that the count's temperament seems to have mellowed some over the course of the journey. You make for Mealvaan's Gate, eager to break new ground in your mission.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKHA203_03957_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;At Mealvaan's Gate, an uncharacteristically diplomatic Lord Charlemend inquires with an assessor as to whether anyone in town might be willing to discuss a potential trade agreement with Ishgard. Though visibly dismayed to find out that this will involve a parley with pirates, he nevertheless resigns himself to the task. For your part, you resolve to follow him and Francel to the Missing Member to see if the Sanguine Sirens might be amenable to the offer.</target>

Doubtless lacking in experience dealing with rougher types, the nobleman is somewhat shaken, but not quite ready to abandon his efforts. Together with Lord Francel, you follow the count to the Seventh Sage, in hopes that the Krakens might prove a more receptive audience.</target>

Just when you fear all hope is lost, the conversation is interrupted by a message from none other than the captain himself, who apparently has agreed to entertain the offer, on the condition that it is &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; and you alone who presents it. Curious as to the reason for this, but not wishing to waste the opportunity, you make your way to the balcony for a parley with the pirate leader.</target>

It would appear that, despite his many misgivings, he is willing to invest in the idea that the nation of Ishgard has truly entered a new age of enlightenment, and that a partnership─albeit a limited one─with the Count de Durendaire might be for the best, after all. Forcing you to swear a promise that you will divulge not his name nor anything about him to your associates, the pirate captain provides you with a written agreement to deliver to Lord Charlemend, and sends you on your way.</target>

Lord Francel, for his part, is delighted as well, as it is now clear that your mission has been an unqualified success─it is but a matter of time now until the markets of Featherfall flourish with a lively exchange of wares from all corners of Eorzea.</target>
