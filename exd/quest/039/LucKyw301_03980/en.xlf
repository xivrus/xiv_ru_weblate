However, none of the locals have sighted anything resembling a large warmachina being moved from the town either by land or air. Though you cannot be certain, it seems likely that the Weapon was transported by sea, possibly to Castrum Marinum or Castrum Occidens in order to complete its construction. You and Gaius elect to investigate the former while Severa and Valdeaulin head for the latter. A member of the Ironworks has been ordered to prepare a submersible in Vesper Bay that you may make your approach.</target>

Once you arrive, however, there is a fairly high chance that you will be greeted by the enigmatic Emerald Weapon, so you had best be prepared for the worst.

After arriving in Castrum Marinum, they found Allie, another of Gaius's orphans, locked in a cell and decided to free her.

Severa knows from personal experience the cruel treatment of those who are not pure-blooded Garleans, and she relates her tale of how she came to defect from the imperial army. Meanwhile, Allie continues to recuperate, and she may now be well enough to speak of what has befallen her and the other orphans, though it would be prudent to first discuss her current condition with Valdeaulin.</target>

As she explains it, Valens is both jealous and cruel, and is willing to use any means at his disposal to achieve his goals, no matter how vile they may be. She also tells of Alfonse's dream of using the power granted to him by the Weapon project to break free from the Empire and establish a safe haven for those who wish to live in peace. Unfortunately, she is unable to say where he is, meaning that you will need to enlist the aid of the Alliance's scouts in locating him. With no immediate danger on the horizon, now seems an opportune time to return to the Resistance troops in Gyr Abania and report the latest series of events.</target>
