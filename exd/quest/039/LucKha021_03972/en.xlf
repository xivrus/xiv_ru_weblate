        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKHA021_03972_AUGEBERT_000_001&lt;tab&gt;As you doubtless already know, Featherfall's to serve as the Firmament's commercial district. Here you'll find a branch office of the Skysteel Manufactory, an impressive residence we call Hoarfrost Hall, and a lively marketplace where you'll find traders and merchants peddlin' goods from the realm over.</target>
