You scan the plaintive note and learn that the guildmaster has encountered some manner of trouble, and requests assistance at your earliest convenience. It would seem that your path leads to a teahouse in front of the Sekiseigumi Barracks in Kugane...</target>

Robbery and public indecency notwithstanding, the guildmaster assures you that he is finally able to set aside some time to pursue the true purpose of his journey. He would, however, appreciate any aid you can render during his investigation into the Fukumen Fighting Festival. To that end, you are to make your way to the Shiokaze Hostelry, and learn what information you may from the patrons within.</target>

In an act of contrition─and sniveling cowardice─Gyodo returns the guildmaster's stolen money, and also presents him with an entry token to the festival. A few coins richer, Martyn suggests an immediate visit to the castle gates, where a Fighting Festival ticket taker should be waiting to admit you to the show.</target>

Bluehood, when he eventually does appear, is adamant that he is not the person Martyn thinks he is. The festival's manager, Kageyama, then comes out to cut the guildmaster's tirade short. He challenges the “founder of blue magic” to prove the authenticity of his claims in a duel against the reigning champion, Golden Goliath─a proposal which Martyn recklessly accepts. Wondering at the wisdom of his decision, your erstwhile mentor hurries back to his post at the teahouse.</target>
