After being defeated by Ardbert and the other Warriors of Light a hundred years ago, the Ascian was transformed into Eden and unleashed the Flood of Light. Your attempts to revive the Empty had actually served to weaken the bonds of Light that once held Mitron, who is now capable of far more than simply whispering to Gaia as the voice in her head.

This appears to be an elaborate scheme to awaken Gaia's dormant memories, though the Ascian provides no hint as to how she is connected to events that occurred long before her birth. Gaia herself vehemently refuses to cooperate in any such plan, which succeeds only in sending the Ascian into a blind rage, culminating in Gaia being spirited away by arcane magicks.

She cannot escape the feeling that she has somehow witnessed these events before, a phenomenon that the Ascian is only too glad to elucidate. A hundred years ago, Mitron and Loghrif were tasked with carrying out Emet-Selch's plan to flood the world with Light and thus trigger a Rejoining, only to be defeated by Ardbert and his companions. Though the two Ascians had combined their strength by merging into a single entity, Ardbert's Light-infused final blow shattered the bonds that held them together, destroying Loghrif instantly. Mitron, however, was engulfed in Light before being able to escape to the void, and was transformed into Eden, the first sin eater, and thereby causing the Flood of Light. In the years that followed, Mitron remained trapped within Eden, desperately calling out to Loghrif, who had since been reborn. It is then that the Ascian reveals the awful truth: that Gaia is the reincarnation of Loghrif.

Nevertheless, Gaia is determined to defy the attempts to revive her Ascian consciousness. Since she will not willingly conform, Mitron instead employs dark magicks to merge with her once more, one in body and soul. Though you and Ryne are resolved to free Gaia at all costs, Ryne's mind is assaulted as the fused Ascian seeks to turn her own memories against her.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA303_03977_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Ryne.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA303_03977_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Enter Eden's core.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA303_03977_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Ryne.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="27" approved="yes"><source>27</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA303_03977_TODO_03&lt;tab&gt;Enter Eden's Promise: Litany.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="28" approved="yes"><source>28</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA303_03977_TODO_04&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Ryne.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKRA303_03977_RYNE_000_000&lt;tab&gt;I'm still not sure what that enormous crystal actually does, or why it changes color.
