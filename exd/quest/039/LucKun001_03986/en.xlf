Though he formerly served Elidibus, with the emissary gone, he will be wanting for purpose─a feeling Cyella knows all too well. Concerned for the boy's well-being, she asks that you offer him your support when next you meet in the Source.</target>

It seems he too remembers Cyella─who he knows as Cylva─fondly from their meeting after the fall of the Thirteenth, and is indeed at a loose end as she speculated. In light of both of these truths, he wonders if he mightn't seek her counsel as to what course he should pursue next. The two of you ask the opinion of Urianger, who confirms that this could theoretically be accomplished with the use of a spirit vessel, and agrees to perform the necessary magicks.</target>

When the discussion turns to the history of the Thirteenth, he wonders aloud if it might not be possible to restore balance to that world in the same way you did for the First. Beq Lugg suggests that a thorough understanding of the state of affairs there is necessary to truly know one way or the other. For that, however, you will need to open a gate to the void.</target>

Taynor is initially reticent, pointing out that he is unable to perform a spell of the necessary power without assistance, and that it took him and Nyelbert years of training before they were able to do any such thing─but Cyella suggests that Unukalhai use his talent to intuit via aether the memories and emotions that remain in Nyelbert's crystal. This enables him to understand much of what is required for the technique, as well as how badly Nyelbert wanted to save Taynor from his accidental exile. Moved by his friend's dedication, Taynor is inspired to join hands with Unukalhai and put the power to create hollows to good use at last.</target>
