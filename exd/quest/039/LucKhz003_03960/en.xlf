				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKHZ003_03960_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;On the streets of the newly opened Featherfall, the Count de Durendaire elaborates upon his plans for ensuring a thriving economy in Ishgard, a plan to which your old friend Lord Drillemont is quick to offer his aid. As Charlemend tells it, he seeks to employ his house's formidable fleet of airships as well as the knights who serve in his name─many of whom now sit idle with the war over─to ensure a steady flow of goods both into and out of the Holy See. To accomplish this, he will need an instructor to train a new contingent of pilots and machinists. Drillemont suggests one Sestivald, an accomplished airshipman and veteran of the war who has since fallen on hard times. Charlemend entrusts you with a contract, and you set off for the Brume to extend the offer to the unfortunate man.</target>
