				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESVLT701_03996_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You approach a distressed Lisette de Valentione and learn of her ongoing struggle to educate Astrid, an apprentice emissary. In the midst of their discourse, a moogle by the name of Kupka Kupp appears, and promptly enlists both you and Astrid in a matter of the heart─it seems that his dear friend Elyne requires a special measure of encouragement. After reading her letter idolizing you as an adventurer, it is decided that some time spent at the melancholy girl's long-dreamed-of seaside might help in the formation of a plan. Kupka bids you meet him on the coast of middle La Noscea, near the mouth of the Agelyss River.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESVLT701_03996_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Upon arriving at the mouth of the river, it occurs to Astrid that a painting of the sparkling sea might help lift Elyne out of her melancholy. Kupka volunteers his artistic talents, then suggests that the exotic scent of the flowers which bloom to the northwest of Tiller's Rest would add another stimulating element to Elyne's gift. The chore of picking said flowers falls to you.</target>

It would seem that despite her efforts in martial training, Elyne despairs of ever mastering the skills needed to venture beyond the Twelveswood. A few inspiring words from you, her hero, however, has an almost magical effect in improving her outlook. Thus emboldened, Elyne reveals she has a favor she would ask of you...</target>
