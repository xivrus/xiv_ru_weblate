Fortuitously, you receive an answer in the affirmative from them moments later. As whatever method Beq Lugg has devised is apparently best employed with a minimum of interference from nearby aetherytes, you agree to meet at Laxan Loft to conduct your investigation. </target>

After a short but tense wait, Beq Lugg senses the porxie approaching, and it at last emerges from the portal, safe and sound. Though the Nu Mou is pleased to announce that their familiar has gathered quite a bit of information on conditions in the void, they also caution that it will take considerable time to review it all, let alone come up with a possible means to restore balance to the Thirteenth. Undaunted, Unukalhai vows to wait as long as is necessary if there is any hope of saving his home. As there is little you can do here in the meanwhile, however, you agree to follow Cyella back to the Wandering Stairs.</target>

No sooner does he agree than is he joined by Giott, Granson, and Lue-Reeq, who learned of Unukalhai's mission from Cyella and are determined to see it done.
