        <target state="final">TEXT_BANDWA006_03901_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Following the roaring success of the Rolling Tankards, Ronitt is planning to host a small gathering of those who have contributed to Watts's Anvil. Rather than asking you to visit the far reaches of Norvrandt, extending personal invitations to each guest one by one, he saves you the trouble by volunteering to do the legwork himself, and asks only that you wait for him in Clearmelt with Lorathia.

Nevertheless, it seems their destinies are intrinsically entwined as their mutual rivalry spurs them to push the boundaries of dwarven engineering. The citizens of Norvrandt, meanwhile, stand to benefit a great deal as a result of this friendly competition.</target>
