Thankfully, this troubling episode ends as suddenly as it began, though she is left with the lingering notion of using Darkness to restore the Empty. Ryne soon realizes that this may indeed provide a means by which to revitalize the withered flora. It seems that the Light's influence on the ambient aether is still too strong to allow life to flourish, and shifting the alignment closer to Darkness should redress the balance. The three of you make your way to Eden's core to put your theories to the test.</target>

As you have no experience fighting primals of that nature, your memories of the Cloud of Darkness, ruler among voidsent, will instead form the basis for the summoning.
