        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKTA302_03953_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Sparing but the barest explanation of affairs for the now functional 2P, Anogg immediately solicits the android's help in using the key, which she does all too readily. The ground begins to tremble, and you rush outside to find the village relentlessly bombarded by a number of unknown craft. However, that is far from the only unpleasant surprise, as you soon learn it was 2P herself who brought about the attack, betraying you and your dwarven companions. With your entire party taken off guard by this news, Anogg comes within a hair's breadth of a dire fate at 2P's hands, but thankfully is rescued by a black-garbed android identifying herself as “2B.” Though your faith in androids may not be at its strongest, you have little choice but to ally yourself with 2B as you pursue the nefarious white-garbed group.

Many such machines are controlled by hostile androids, and you bring down one after another until you are at last able to confront 2P─or what she has become. Though the agglomeration of what you can only assume to be semi-formed androids will likely haunt your nightmares for years to come, you win the battle...however, with so many mysteries unsolved, it is clear that the war is not yet over.</target>

According to 2B, the androids are from another world entirely, and the machine lifeforms are invaders even there. She also believes that the white-garbed androids were created by the machines to fight the original, black-garbed androids as part of their ongoing conflict. What any of this means for the First is difficult to ascertain, but it seems that as the enemy of your enemy, 2B can be considered a friend for now─in which case, the android boy with whom you previously clashed in the Copied Factory may well be too.</target>
