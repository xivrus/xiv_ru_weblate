Enter Royse. Driven beyond the limits of her patience and determined to take matters into her own hands, the Celestium's manager arrives in Kugane like a wrathful storm. She informs you of the appointment she has arranged with Nutiba Buntiba outside the castle gates, and commands you to accompany her there at once.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBAOZ700_03993_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;After admitting his part in exploiting Royse and Martyn's accomplishments, a shamefaced Nutiba lays before you the sorry tale of his betrothal and subsequent servitude as a prisoner of Kageyama's ruthless manipulations. Then, as if summoned by the cursing of his name, Kageyama emerges from the castle with Golden Goliath in tow. At first, he balks at Royse's insistence on a rematch, but once she sweetens the pot with ownership rights to the Masked Carnivale, the Kugane merchant prince seems positively eager to seal the deal. You and Golden Goliath are now scheduled to duel in the Celestium, an arrangement which sees you and Martyn packing your bags for the return journey to Ul'dah.</target>
