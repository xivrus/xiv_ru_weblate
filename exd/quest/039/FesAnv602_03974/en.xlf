With the opening of the Rising festivities fast approaching, the only viable option is to piece together the artwork as best you can before the spectators arrive.

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESANV602_03974_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;The art exhibition and accompanying song courtesy of the wandering minstrel are met with resounding applause, and many in the crowd were deeply moved by the message of goodwill towards one's fellow man. Astin, who had made up his mind to attend after all, found the tale of the Sultana's Seven particularly relevant to his current situation. He chooses to give up the life of a moneylender in order to return to working as an art dealer, and he offers to find buyers for J'bhen Tia's stained glass. The young virtuoso is overjoyed that Astin has turned over a new leaf and offers you his heartfelt thanks in not only rescuing the exhibition, but also their friendship. He then mentions that the wandering minstrel is looking for you, though you will need to speak with him yourself to find out why.</target>

You are then swept away on the waves of a divine melody to another realm entirely, free from the bounds of time and space. You are met by the enigmatic Naoki Yoshida and his Lalafellin companions, who appear to have been expecting you. Though his words are somewhat cryptic, his sincerity is unmistakable. You are eventually returned to the present day, whereupon the minstrel welcomes you back from your waking dream. He performs one last song, while the fireworks above fill the night sky.</target>
