        <target state="final">TEXT_FESANV602_03974_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In J'bhen Tia's absence, the stained glass that he had so painstakingly created has been accidentally shattered by a group of children who got a little too close to the exhibit. With the opening of the Rising festivities fast approaching, the only viable option is to piece together the artwork as best you can before the spectators arrive.

Their relationship has been somewhat troubled of late, and J'Bhen feels that the invitation would be better received if delivered by a third party, namely, you.</target>

Astin, who had made up his mind to attend after all, found the tale of the Sultana's Seven particularly relevant to his current situation. He chooses to give up the life of a moneylender in order to return to working as an art dealer, and he offers to find buyers for J'bhen Tia's stained glass. The young virtuoso is overjoyed that Astin has turned over a new leaf and offers you his heartfelt thanks in not only rescuing the exhibition, but also their friendship. He then mentions that the wandering minstrel is looking for you, though you will need to speak with him yourself to find out why.</target>

You are met by the enigmatic Naoki Yoshida and his Lalafellin companions, who appear to have been expecting you. Though his words are somewhat cryptic, his sincerity is unmistakable.
