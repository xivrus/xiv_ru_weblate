On this occasion, a work of fine art in stained glass serves as the focal point, and its creator, J'bhen Tia is on hand to explain his inspiration.

To accompany the artwork, a wandering minstrel of great renown is due to give a recital to commemorate the event, and J'bhen Tia would like you to help distribute flyers to drum up as large a crowd as possible.
