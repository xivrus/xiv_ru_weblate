Said means is currently housed at the Skysteel workshop in the Firmament, however, so you will need to venture there and witness it for yourself if you are to understand without enduring a moon's worth of engineering talk.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKHT021_03982_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;At the workshop, you find none other than Stephanivien, master of the Skysteel Manufactory. He is accompanied by an ambulatory piece of machina recovered from Azys Lla that, as it transpires, is the key to performing the delicate operations necessary to realize the latest and greatest Skysteel design. Though Neillemard and Nimie will not be available to assist this time around, they seem confident that between this mechanical marvel and the skills of workshop engineers Joellie and Emeny, the fruits of your labors will be fully worth the effort.</target>
