        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKSA111_03951_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Your defeat of the imperial soldiers is almost effortless. Before you can plot your next move, however, Misija appears before you with Mikoto, as well as the crystal focus and the legendary blade Save the Queen. Using Mikoto as leverage, Misija coerces you into activating the crystal focus to explore the memories of the holy blade. Her intent is soon made clear when, moments later, Queen Gunnhildr emerges as a primal-like entity, enslaving the minds of the soldiers bearing the title of her guard. The threat of the queen proved too great, forcing the Resistance to retreat from the castrum.</target>

Having now lost both the castrum and Gunnhildr's Blades, the Resistance must think long and hard on how next to proceed.</target>
