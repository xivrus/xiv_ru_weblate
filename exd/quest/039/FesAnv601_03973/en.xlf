        <target state="final">TEXT_FESANV601_03973_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Rising festival is known for bringing a splash of color to Ul'dah each year. On this occasion, a work of fine art in stained glass serves as the focal point, and its creator, J'bhen Tia is on hand to explain his inspiration. He has chosen to depict one of the pivotal moments in Ul'dahn history prior to the Calamity in which Nanamo Ul Namo addressed the rioting masses, imploring them to put aside their grievances and instead cooperate for the greater good. To accompany the artwork, a wandering minstrel of great renown is due to give a recital to commemorate the event, and J'bhen Tia would like you to help distribute flyers to drum up as large a crowd as possible.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

His friend Astin, a moneylender, is engaged in a heated argument with a local merchant, and it falls to J'bhen Tia to diffuse the situation. The artist explains that disputes such as these are precisely the reason why he chose the subject matter for his stained glass art, with Astin a prime example of one whose compassionate side is overshadowed by his obsession with turning a profit. The two of you agree to meet back at the Ruby Road Exchange to prepare to receive the attendees at the Rising celebrations.</target>
