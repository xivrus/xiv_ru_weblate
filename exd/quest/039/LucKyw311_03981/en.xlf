Many people her age were enlisted in the army and sent to war, never to return, and she wishes to commemorate them with a monument bearing their names. She believes that a comprehensive list of conscripted soldiers can be found in the imperial hangar below the town, but she needs you to persuade the Ironworks members to permit her entry.</target>

Avilina is able to find the list she needed to complete her monument, but her eye was drawn to one name in particular: Milisandia, who you know as the pilot of the Ruby Weapon. You then learn that Avilina and Milisandia were close friends and once served together in the XIVth Legion until fate conspired to separate them. Guided by your words of encouragement, Avilina resolves to use the skills she gained working as a magitek engineer to help the Ironworks in preparation for the struggle with the Empire. And though she will no doubt find herself very busy in the days to come, she remains determined to build a monument to Terncliff's fallen.</target>
