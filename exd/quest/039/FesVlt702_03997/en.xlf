It is then that Elyne suggests that the performers don Valentione-styled costumes, a proposal which is received enthusiastically by all involved. An excited Astrid immediately offers to return to Gridania to make the necessary arrangements. In the meantime, the seneschal wonders if you would be willing to lend him a helping hand...</target>
