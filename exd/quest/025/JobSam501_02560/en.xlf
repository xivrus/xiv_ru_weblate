Unimpressed, Musosai calmly cuts his sword in half and sends him fleeing as quickly as he appeared. With that distraction out of the way, you square off against the elderly Hingan and succeed in besting him, though you get the sense that he held back. Nonetheless, Musosai heaps ample praise upon you and offers you your reward: training in the way of the samurai. Before you can form a response, however, Beroald disrupts the proceedings yet again, and this time he has brought friends. Believing you more than capable, Musosai leaves you to attend the uninvited guests, which you handily do. In desperation and frustration, Beroald turns his fury upon Musosai, only to be sent sprawling by the old man. With that, your eventful challenge comes to an end.</target>

A samurai's calling, he explains, is to seek out the wicked and bring them to account, that such a tragedy may never be repeated. To that end, you will journey the land on a quest to right wrongs, and in so doing walk the path towards mastery of your art. As Musosai declares his intent to begin this quest in Ul'dah, the silver-tongued showmaster, Momozigo, arrives and offers to assist you on your quest. Until such time as they identify a likely evil to excise, Musosai bids you continue honing your newfound skills.

※The next samurai quest will be available from Musosai upon reaching level 52.</target>
