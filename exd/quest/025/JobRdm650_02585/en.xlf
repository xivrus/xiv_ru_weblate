From its pages, he has gleaned that Lambard and Arya are both descendants of a Mhachi sorcerer─an archmagus who forged a dark pact with the voidsent Lilith, and took her blood inside his own body. According to the story, the first Calowise then entrapped the fiendish queen upon the physical plane to preserve the potency of her gift. Thus do you come to the conclusion that the path to lifting the curse of Arya's affliction lies in releasing Lilith's soul to the void. X'rhun means to follow the clues in the memoirs to uncover the voidsent's prison, but first insists that you rest and prepare for the adventure which lies ahead!
