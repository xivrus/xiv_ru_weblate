				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBPLD700_02575_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;No sooner do you arrive in the arena than a damnably curious spectator exposes Black Lotus as Aldis. Though the crowd is initially shocked, Mylla succeeds in rallying everyone behind the match. At this time, Nanamo steps in and gives her blessing for the contest to proceed. With no obstacles left to bar your way, you and Aldis finally square off. At the end of a furious clash, you emerge the victor and are crowned champion of the Ul Cup. Nanamo makes to present you with the promised tome of secret techniques, but Papashan confesses that such an item never existed. The true purpose in bringing together the highest names in swordplay, he explains, was to raise the gladiatorial arts higher, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the realm in the face of multiple threats. At length, Nanamo turns her attention to the question of Aldis's banishment, and by a simple utterance grants him a royal pardon.</target>

Mylla protests, but he will not be swayed; his defeat to you made it clear he still wants for experience, and he will not know peace until he has gained it. As Aldis departs, he expresses his eagerness to meet you again in battle. In anticipation of that day, you resolve to continue striving for greater heights in your art.
