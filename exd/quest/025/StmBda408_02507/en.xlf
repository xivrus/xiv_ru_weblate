        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA408_02507_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;If you are to participate in the Naadam and fight alongside the Mol, you must first be recognized as a warrior of the Steppe. To earn this honor, you will be required to complete a rite of passage involving walking in the footsteps of the legendary Bardam and taming a yol. Steeling yourselves, you and your comrades set forth upon the peril-fraught path of the hero's namesake.

※Challenge Bardam's Mettle with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point.</target>
