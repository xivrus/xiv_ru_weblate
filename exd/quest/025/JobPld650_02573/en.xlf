Your fellow free paladin Constaint comes away with a hard-fought win over Franz the Fair, but is left too spent to have a chance against the ever-reliable Mylla. This leaves the group final to be fought between the First Sword and the mysterious Black Lotus. In a quality encounter, neither side yields the other ground, then seemingly out of nowhere Black Lotus claims victory with what can only be described as a sublime shield swipe. So it is that your opponent in the Ul Cup final is decided. As the dust settles, perhaps it would be meet to offer words of consolation to those who fell short, starting with Constaint and Franz.</target>
