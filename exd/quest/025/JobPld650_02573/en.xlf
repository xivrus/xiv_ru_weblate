Your fellow free paladin Constaint comes away with a hard-fought win over Franz the Fair, but is left too spent to have a chance against the ever-reliable Mylla. This leaves the group final to be fought between the First Sword and the mysterious Black Lotus. In a quality encounter, neither side yields the other ground, then seemingly out of nowhere Black Lotus claims victory with what can only be described as a sublime shield swipe.
