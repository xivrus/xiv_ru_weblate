        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSAM540_02562_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In the course of an inadvertent brush with the law, Musosai has learned that a serial killer has been terrorizing Limsa Lominsa. What is more, the murderer's weapon of choice appears to be a katana, meaning you may be dealing with a fellow samurai. At Momozigo's suggestion, you turn your steps towards Hawkers' Alley, there to ask the locals about the criminal.</target>

He proposes luring the criminal out with a trap, and Momozigo reluctantly accepts his role as the bait. With that settled, your companions set off for Fisherman's Bottom, where they will set the trap.</target>

All is not in vain, however, for Musosai recognizes the blade the criminal brandished. It would seem the suspect is a Lalafellin merchant who harbors a fetish for Far Eastern blades. Momozigo mentions Gegeruju, the master of Costa del Sol, though he is not entirely convinced of his guilt. For want of another lead, however, Musosai decides to confront the man at his resort.</target>

Based on what you are told, it seems beyond doubt that this is the killer you seek. To help you infiltrate the man's ship, which lies at anchor off the coast, Gegeruju furnishes you with an invitation to a banquet along with a disguise for Momozigo. With this, you should be able to have Gurumi Borlumi's retainer ferry you to his master's ship.</target>

When Musosai confronts the man about the killings, he readily owns up to them, his eyes glinting with a sick pleasure. He unleashes his cavalcade of guards upon you, from false shinobi to his pet Yanxian beast to finally his chief bodyguard, a samurai pretender named Ostyrgrein. Between you and Musosai, you overcome all of Gurumi Borlumi's men, whereupon he promptly turns tail and abandons ship. Musosai sets off in pursuit, with you not far behind.</target>

Nonetheless, he is unwilling to admit defeat, and placing undue faith in his katana, turns it upon Musosai. Deeming the man beyond redemption, your master summarily puts an end to him. But no sooner does the old man declare your work done than he falls to his knees for his recent exertions. Regaining his feet, he assures you all is well and bids Momozigo lead the way to the next stage of your quest: the forest nation of Gridania.</target>
