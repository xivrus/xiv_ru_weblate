All is not in vain, however, for Musosai recognizes the blade the criminal brandished. It would seem the suspect is a Lalafellin merchant who harbors a fetish for Far Eastern blades. Momozigo mentions Gegeruju, the master of Costa del Sol, though he is not entirely convinced of his guilt.

Based on what you are told, it seems beyond doubt that this is the killer you seek. To help you infiltrate the man's ship, which lies at anchor off the coast, Gegeruju furnishes you with an invitation to a banquet along with a disguise for Momozigo.

He unleashes his cavalcade of guards upon you, from false shinobi to his pet Yanxian beast to finally his chief bodyguard, a samurai pretender named Ostyrgrein.

But no sooner does the old man declare your work done than he falls to his knees for his recent exertions.
