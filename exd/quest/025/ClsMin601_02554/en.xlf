Blessed with the gift of the gab, he eloquently explains that he is a gobbie on a mission─an epic one that entails him and his workers pushing the very boundaries of technology to their utmost limits! You are informed that your services are required to procure some rare minerals necessary to build the Gobroller: a machine they hope can someday be used to reclaim the Sharlayan ruins. Nonowato suggests leaving the sweaty confines of the manufactory so he can explain the schedule for the vehicle's construction.</target>
