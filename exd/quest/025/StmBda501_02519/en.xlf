The twins and the shinobi will then disable the magitek field generators within the Dairyu Moon Gates, allowing the Confederate and Kojin naval forces to bombard the castle and secure the Doman Enclave. Finally, Lord Hien's main host will advance upon the castle and deal with the imperial forces within.
