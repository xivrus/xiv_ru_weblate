The Hearer brings grave tidings from the Twelveswood─a pack of golems has escaped from the ruins of the Lost City of Amdapor and now threatens to run roughshod over the forest. As if spurred to action, the memory of Shatotto stirs, and dashes off with Lalai's corporeal body in tow to see to the threat as only she knows how. At the Hearer's behest, you make for the Shroud to see what news the Wailer Alphene has of the threat.</target>

Incinerate any suspicious-looking stone structures with your most potent fire magic, and lay waste to any rampaging golems that might manifest themselves in the process.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBLM630_02589_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;At least moderately impressed with your command of the destructive arts, Shatotto deigns to share with you and your friends the nature of the threat the realm faces. As she tells it, two millennia ago when she still lived, a wayward comet threatened to crash into the city of Mhach─a crisis averted by the power of black magic, an art which she had devised at least in part for that very task. Fragments that broke off the comet hurtled to the earth, and were later unearthed, affording the mages of the realm untold powers. There remains, however, a further complication. Shatotto posits that the stones call out to each other with aetheric signals, augmenting each other's power─a phenomenon which could result in disaster should the comet once again draw near, as Shatotto predicts will happen in the days to come. Zhai'a Nelhah is naturally skeptical, but nonetheless is determined to do his part to see that the realm does not come to peril. Reconvene with your friends at Milvaneth Sacrarium, that you might formulate a plan of attack.</target>
