He explains that he withdrew from the tournament in order to save a boy he met during his wanderings, whom unscrupulous match-fixers took hostage in the mistaken belief that he is Aldis's own. At this time an unimpressed Mylla arrives, and Aldis goes on to reveal that rumors of your surpassing skills are what drew him back to Ul'dah. His mention of a child leaves her dismayed, but the questions must wait, for the boy has yet to be released. Aldis means to track down the abductors and mount a rescue, and bids you ask after shady sorts in Pearl Lane.</target>

And then to Mylla's relief, he clarifies that the boy is not in fact his own. All is well, then, save for the fact that a dream match between you and Aldis was not to be. However, Mylla tells you not to give up, for she believes she can convince the organizers to host the Ul Cup final. Leaving to entrust the child to the Brass Blades' care, she bids you join her back at the guild afterwards.</target>
