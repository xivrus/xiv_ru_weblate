Even as Master Fugetsu inquires as to your own progress, however, your conversation is interrupted by the entrance of a bustling Gyosei who is soon to depart for distant lands. Seizing the opportunity, Blanstyr offers to forge the samurai a set of armor by way of an apology for his past behavior. Meet your fellow artisan outside Kokajiya, and discuss what might make a suitable gift.</target>

He returns a moment later in full battle gear, clearly moved by the gift's fine quality and personal touches. The samurai then hurriedly departs for his new appointment in high spirits, much to the satisfaction of the assembled armorers. Blanstyr, too, makes to depart, feeling that he has finally achieved what he set out to learn, but is stopped by Master Fugetsu. Fascinated by the possibilities of Lominsan plate techniques, it seems Kokajiya's head armorer would now become the apprentice. Blanstyr elects to stay in Kugane, and sends you back to Limsa Lominsa to explain this development to H'naanza.</target>
