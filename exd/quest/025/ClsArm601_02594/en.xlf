Wishing to infuse his own work with a greater degree of “character,” it would appear Blanstyr has his mind set on studying at the feet of Far Eastern masters. Return to H'naanza, and report what you have learned.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSARM601_02594_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;As you explain Blanstyr's reasoning to the forgemaster, the artisan himself makes an appearance. He attempts to berate H'naanza for prying into his business, but she brushes aside his complaints, explaining that he is welcome to take a leave of absence for the sake of self-improvement. Satisfied that his position at the forge will be waiting for him upon his return, a placated Blanstyr soon departs for his pilgrimage to the Far East. H'naanza promises to inform you should she hear word from the impulsive artisan...

※The next armorer quest will be available from H'naanza upon reaching level 63.</target>
