He attempts to berate H'naanza for prying into his business, but she brushes aside his complaints, explaining that he is welcome to take a leave of absence for the sake of self-improvement. Satisfied that his position at the forge will be waiting for him upon his return, a placated Blanstyr soon departs for his pilgrimage to the Far East. H'naanza promises to inform you should she hear word from the impulsive artisan...
