According to Makoto, the man committed seppuku in order to atone for his failure in dealing with the insurgents. But there is no time to mourn or even hold funeral rites, for the Tairo is about to arrive, and the Sekiseigumi must ensure his safety. Makoto has been tasked with patrolling the Short Pier, and she asks that you join her in keeping watch for suspicious activity.</target>

It does not take long for Makoto to deduce that he is a traitor, and he proceeds to tell you of his disillusionment with the Sekiseigumi and subsequent recruitment to Ugetsu's cause. With the preamble thus finished, you and Makoto lock swords with Shiden and his fellow turncoats. As the battle unfolds, Captain Kongo, believed dead till now, joins the fray with those still faithful, and with their help you emerge triumphant.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSAM650_02568_SEQ_08&lt;tab&gt;Rather than be taken alive, Shiden turns his blade on himself, and Captain Kongo bids a solemn farewell to his old friend. Turning to you and Makoto, the captain then reveals how he narrowly escaped death in an ambush, after which he laid low that he might keep watch over the traitors' movements. With the Tairo safe and the Sekiseigumi ranks purged of insurgents, you may return to the barracks to continue the conversation.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSAM650_02568_SEQ_09&lt;tab&gt;Captain Kongo begs your forgiveness for his earlier discourtesy, and shares with you what he was able to learn from the apprehended traitors. While much of Ugetsu's operations have come to light, little is still known of his whereabouts beyond that he makes his base somewhere in the vast expanse of Yanxia, upon the mainland. Makoto raises the doubt you have been harboring: how does serving a hedonist such as the Tairo serve the nation? For his many vices, the captain explains, the man is instrumental in keeping the realm whole, and though the bakufu may be a cesspool of corruption, it is the samurai's calling to protect the peace. Though you are come from afar, you share this calling, and both the captain and Makoto ask that you continue lending your blade to the cause.

※The next samurai quest will be available from Makoto upon reaching level 68.</target>
