After studying the lore at hand, Yayake provides you with not only the location for Lilith's ritual, but also a hint for surviving the coming confrontation─a ready supply of antidotes. X'rhun then steps away to contact Jessie, and arrange an airship to carry you both to the ruined city in the middle of Yafaem's impassable swampland. Speak with him upon his return.</target>

On the other hand, however, Arya's liberation from Lilith's influence and subsequent loss of power means that she must relearn the arcane arts at the most fundamental level. Until she is once more ready to take the red, the Crimson Duelist means to hang up his mentor's mantle and return to his pilgrimage. But rather than mourn this separation, X'rhun seems positive that the paths of you who defy the tides of destiny will one day cross again...

※The next red mage quest will be available from Arya once you have met the following requirements:
※FINAL FANTASY XIV: Shadowbringers must be registered to your service account.
※You must have completed the main scenario quest “Shadowbringers.”
※You must have completed the role quest “A Tearful Reunion.”</target>
