Fortunately, Wiscar─a youth from Ala Gannha whom you inspired to join the Resistance─has surmised the existence of a tunnel connecting Loch Seld and a well within the district. The entrance to the well is secured by lock and key, but since you now have said key in your possession, you need only locate the tunnel.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA703_02550_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Just as you and your comrades are about to dive into the loch, Urianger makes an unexpected appearance. The Archon duly explains that after listening to Alisaie's tale of her defeat at Fordola's hands, he was inspired to fashion a new and improved aetheric siphon, which he believes will enable you to deprive the Skulls commander of her preternatural prescience. Though Urianger seems unwilling to disclose the device's precise function, you receive it gratefully, conscious that you may have need of it during the coming mission.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA703_02550_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Sure enough, in the depths of Loch Seld, you and your comrades locate a tunnel leading east towards the Ala Mhigan Quarter.

Before continuing, you review your plan to let the Resistance in, and rescue Krile.

Thankfully, however, you have come prepared. Activating Urianger's device, you watch the Skulls commander reel about in confusion, and it soon becomes clear that she can no longer anticipate your attacks. Though she is yet a fearsome opponent, you are the Warrior of Light, and after a vicious battle, you are able to subdue her and secure the facility. To your relief, you find Krile alive, albeit weak from her ordeal, and together you make ready to leave, with Fordola as your prisoner. However, the beaten officer belittles your victory, speaking of the terrible powers Zenos commands and the futility of your sacrifices. For an instant, it seems as though Lyse will succumb to her anger and execute her defenseless foe, but in the end she relents, declaring that Fordola will live long enough to see a free Ala Mhigo.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="7" approved="yes"><source>7</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA703_02550_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;Alphinaud is overjoyed.
