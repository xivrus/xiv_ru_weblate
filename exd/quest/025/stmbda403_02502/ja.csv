Long ago, guided by a vision received by her grandmother, she ventured into the southern mountains and there found Hien, near death. Cirina brought the Doman lord to her village, where they nursed him back to health, and there he has remained ever since, until such time as he can repay his debt to them. He often accompanies her to Reunion, though he has a habit of frequenting a spot atop the cliff to the east of the marketplace...","TEXT_STMBDA403_02502_SEQ_01<tab>再会の市でヒエンの手がかりを探したところ、彼を知るモル族のシリナに出会った。シリナの買い物に協力したことで、ついにヒエンの居場所を知った冒険者たち。再会の市周辺で「ヒエン」を探そう。","","False","0x00000001","",""
