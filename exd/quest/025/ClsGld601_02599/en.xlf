        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSGLD601_02599_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;On a sudden visit to the Goldsmiths' Guild, Her Royal Majesty Nanamo Ul Namo informs you of her initiative to breathe new life into Ala Mhigo's war-stalled economy. The plan involves establishing an artisans' school training goldsmiths, and the sultana would have you be its schoolmaster. Betokening her hopes for the school, she donates a priceless heirloom for use in your work─her lady mother's jewel-studded crown─and you cannot help but oblige her request. Your apprentices-to-be have already gathered at Spineless Basin in central Thanalan, and Marcel bids you join him there for a meet and greet.</target>
