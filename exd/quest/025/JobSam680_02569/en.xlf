The duel is over in an instant, and the captain collapses to the ground, the life draining out of him. With his last breath, he names Makoto his successor to lead the Sekiseigumi. But her authority is immediately undermined, as Ugetsu reveals that she is in fact his younger sister, Kagetsu. The insurgent leader proclaims his intent to change Hingashi with fire and blood, and invites those present to join his cause─you, his &lt;var 08 E905 ((sister)) ((brother)) /var&gt; pupil, included. Yet though no one answers his call, uncertainty is writ plain on all faces. Ugetsu then proposes a battle between your two factions to decide matters, but as he leaves, he taunts Makoto that she may want for allies. Makoto attempts to rally her men, but with her identity exposed, her words are met with a lukewarm response.

She and Ugetsu were born into a samurai family in the capital, and from a tender age her brother exhibited great talent in the katana. Musosai took him as his pupil, and together they took to the road for his training. But the Ugetsu who returned was a changed man, one filled with anger and despair both, who dreamed of toppling the bakufu. The situation came to a head when he assassinated Hingan dignitaries, a crime for which his entire family paid with their lives─all except for Kagetsu herself, who managed to escape. Thereafter she journeyed to Kugane, where she took the name Makoto and knocked on the Sekiseigumi's doors. Since that time, she has lived to punish her brother, but even as his cause grows in strength, hers only weakens on account of the blood she shares with Ugetsu. With the captain gone, she has naught to depend upon save her own conviction...and you.
