"","TEXT_STMBDA706_02553_SEQ_01<tab>After convincing the Ferae Domitae to withdraw, you and Alphinaud rejoin the main host outside the gates, and the assault begins in earnest. All proceeds as planned until a unit of airborne magitek armor launches a counterattack, throwing the Allied forces into chaos... Moments later, however, your Far Eastern allies, led by Lord Hien, swoop in to the rescue, engage the imperial flying machines, and leave the Alliance free to resume their attack. The gate buckles under the renewed assault, and soon gives way.

Now begins the battle for the future of a nation. Together with the brave men and women of the Eorzean Alliance and the Resistance, you must enter the city and make for the castle where Zenos yae Galvus resides, and put an end to his reign of terror.

Zenos fawns over the primal, which he proclaims a being of pure violence, and muses upon how instrumental you were in its creation and capture. You regard him silently as he proceeds to mock his great-grandfather's legacy, while hinting at his own dark ambitions, biding your time to strike. At last, he declares that all he has done, he did but for the joy of doing it, and that only man has the wisdom and the clarity to embrace violence for its own sake...as you have.

His manifesto thus delivered, Zenos frees Shinryu from its restraints and cries out defiantly as it bathes you both in dragon fire. Unscathed, your foe rises into the air and uses his power as a Resonant to merge with the primal, binding it to his will. As he towers over you, transformed, he glimpses Ilberd's final moments, and declares this to be “an ending to mark a new beginning,” before taking to the air. Nor is he mistaken. For if you and your comrades do not stop Zenos yae Galvus...no one will.
