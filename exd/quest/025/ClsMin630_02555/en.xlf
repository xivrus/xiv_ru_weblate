        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSMIN630_02555_STICKQIX_000_088&lt;tab&gt;I would not be so sure. If you combine your skills, there is no reason that the impossible need remain so. Stacking the two types of metal to create a new kind of armor—one which fulfills all our needs—is something I imagine you two are quite capable of doing.
