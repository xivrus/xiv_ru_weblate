Shatotto, who has once again assumed control of Lalai's consciousness, expresses her disbelief that constructs she herself played a part in creating could be behaving in such a manner, leading the ever-wary Zhai'a Nelhah to doubt her motivations. You set out for the Tangle, where the golems were last sighted, in hopes of finding further answers.</target>
