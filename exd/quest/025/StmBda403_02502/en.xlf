        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA403_02502_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Your search for the missing heir of Doma on the Azim Steppe has led you to Cirina, a young woman of the Mol tribe. Long ago, guided by a vision received by her grandmother, she ventured into the southern mountains and there found Hien, near death. Cirina brought the Doman lord to her village, where they nursed him back to health, and there he has remained ever since, until such time as he can repay his debt to them. He often accompanies her to Reunion, though he has a habit of frequenting a spot atop the cliff to the east of the marketplace...</target>

Yet even after you tell him of Doma's rekindled spirits, he states that he cannot go home─not until he has won the ceremonial battle known as the Naadam and thereby earned the right to bid the Xaela follow him to Doma. A daunting task, by any measure, but likely a necessary one, given the Liberation Front's depleted forces. Reluctantly, Yugiri departs to deliver the news to your comrades in the south, leaving you, Lyse, and Gosetsu to assist Lord Hien in his bold endeavor.</target>
