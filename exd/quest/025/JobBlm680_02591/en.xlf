It would appear that the greatest threat is posed not by the man-made creatures that you have faced thus far, but rather self-animated monstrosities formed of materials attracted by the burgeoning aetheric power of the gemstones. In hopes of assessing the true nature of the threat, the Hearer Zhai'a Nelhah sets out in one direction in the company of the beastman trio, entrusting you and Shatotto to look into troubling reports from the village of Ala Gannha.</target>

She congratulates you on your own efforts, then shares a troubling sight she witnessed. As she tells it, the golems are turning upon each other, as if driven by an animal instinct to seek greater and greater power. Your conversation is interrupted by a linkpearl transmission from Zhai'a Nelhah, who claims to have witnessed a still more fearsome sight─a veritable legion of golems assembling in Dravania for purposes unknown. As Shatotto and the Hearer make for the Observatorium to see what has been learned of the comet, you set off on a return path to Burgundy Falls, that you and your beastman friends might discuss your next course of action.</target>

In the face of certain doom, Shatotto reveals her master plan: put simply, you will wait for the golems to cannibalize each other time and again until but a single golem remains. You will then confront this creation─the mother of all golems, as it were─and blast it to tiny fragments with the power of your black magic. For whatever it is worth, Shatotto and Zhai'a Nelhah appear to have the utmost confidence in your ability to succeed in this daunting task. As Shatotto prepares to return to slumber in anticipation of the final confrontation, you, too, make for Ul'dah, that you might speak with Lalai one last time before resuming your studies.</target>
