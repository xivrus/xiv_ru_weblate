If you would answer the call, you are asked to come to the Sekiseigumi Barracks in Kugane.</target>

Their coming had somehow been made known to the enemy, who received them with an ambush. Her voice laden with sorrow, Makoto tells you about her slain comrade. Hailing from a poor farming village, he joined the Sekiseigumi in hopes of bringing about change to Hingan society─a society that holds people hostage to their birth. Ugetsu and his insurgents, too, seek to bring about change, but they would do so by plunging the entire realm into chaos. Having finished holding forth on her passions, she sees to carrying her comrade back to the barracks and bids you join her there.</target>

Aside from Makoto, he alone is privy to your identity as Musosai's pupil, a fact you are told to keep secret lest it attract undue suspicion. You are then brought before Captain Kongo, who immediately mistrusts you and makes his sentiments known by way of a drawn blade. Though he is eventually persuaded to sheathe it, he leaves you with a grave warning nonetheless. Shiden apologizes for the captain's outburst, explaining that the man has been under great pressure of late. And to add to their burdens, His Excellency the Tairo, one of the nation's most powerful men, is due to come to Kugane on an embassy visit. The task of providing security falls to the Sekiseigumi, and you are asked to assist when the time comes.

※The next samurai quest will be available from Makoto upon reaching level 65.</target>
