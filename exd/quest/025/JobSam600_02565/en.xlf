The man's crime, he reveals, was to create a killer; his pupil slaughtered numerous dignitaries of Hingashi, and by the laws of the land, Kogarashi was held equally responsible for the heinous deed. Instead of atoning with his life, however, he fled with it to Eorzea, and it falls to Musosai to bring him to account. Yet try as he might, he has been unable to render justice unto the fugitive. Strong as you have become, Musosai is confident that you will be able to accomplish that which he could not, and so he assigns you your final trial: defeat Kogarashi. You set off with your master for Twinpools, where the villain is said to be hiding.</target>

For &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;he&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; is Kogarashi, the loathsome wretch who caused countless deaths yet feared his own. Having lamented failing his pupil and living in disgrace, he demands once more that you render unto him his punishment, and comes at you with steel singing. Left with no recourse, you meet Musosai in battle, each blow you deal hurting no less than each you receive. At the end of a grueling encounter, your master falls to the ground, battered and bloodied.</target>

His purpose thus fulfilled, he instructs you to end it once and for all. As you prepare to draw, a distraught Momozigo scrambles up and begs you to stop. Undeterred, you swing with all your might and excise the evil in Musosai, thereby granting him the peace he had long yearned for. With his companions by his side, Musosai breathes his last, and you bury him by the cliff at the Silver Bazaar, where he might watch the setting sun begin its return journey to Hingashi─to his homeland.</target>

Momozigo expresses his hopes that you will carry on Musosai's legacy, protecting the peace and remembering always: “Such evil cannot be suffered!”
