Considering the relation between Lambard and the Empire, you conclude that this imperial base is likely the source of the cabal's orders.

Such a crippling blow to the Ironworks would have repercussions across Eorzea, and it seems the cabal will stop at nothing to achieve its objective. Lambard must be defeated.
