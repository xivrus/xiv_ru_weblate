It is from a prospective recruit who, aside from expressing interest in the guild and stating they will be arriving in Eorzea shortly, has neglected to mention anything of actual significance. Without a name, gender, or age to determine who they might be, Forgemaster Brithael knows there is only one person up to the task of tracking them down and seeing that they are escorted back. Make your way to the Limsa Lominsa ferry docks and see if anybody there catches your eye.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM601_02593_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You come across a girl draped in Far Eastern finery, who─along with an unctuous-looking man─appears to have been apprehended by a Yellowjacket. As you approach, she calls out to you, asking if you have come to escort her to the Blacksmiths' Guild. The officer, thinking you know her, informs you he has arrested the young woman for attempting to slash at the man beside her for his unwelcome advances. He then proceeds to release her to you under the agreement that you keep her sword from her. The Far Eastern girl, clearly insulted, pipes up to say that the weapon is no regular sword but rather a katana she forged herself. She asks that you present it to Forgemaster Brithael as testament to her skill as a smithy. Show the girl to the guild and present her katana to Brithael.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM601_02593_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;As Forgemaster Brithael is appraising the quality of the katana, the girl from the docks bursts in through the doors. Mentioning she lost you on your way back to the guild, she then launches into a self-introduction. She is Sekka from Kugane, an aspiring swordsmith who has come to Eorzea to study under Brithael. When the forgemaster moves to induct her into the guild in an official capacity, however, she quickly declines the offer, instead begging him to take her under his wings off the books. He tells her the only way he can agree to those terms is if she were to share her family's smithing techniques in exchange for what she would learn at the guild─an offer she is quick to accept before leaving as abruptly as she came.
