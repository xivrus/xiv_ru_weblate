Realizing that a history lesson is no substitute for practical experience, however, X'rhun suggests that an attempt to uncover the identity of the kidnappers might provide the battle practice you require.

Your implacable foes show neither fear nor remorse, and their leader freely sacrifices himself to summon a monstrous void hound.
