        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDA618_02544_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Alliance and the Resistance cannot suffer a repeat of the slaughter at Specula Imperatoris. As such, they will not march upon Castrum Abania until they can be certain the fortress's main cannon will not be brought to bear against them. Though the weapon was apparently disabled by a single unknown assailant, it is only a matter of time before it is restored to operational status. With the aid of an Alliance contact in Radiata, you and your comrades have devised a plan to infiltrate the castrum and seize control of the cannon's fire control center, after which you will signal the Allied forces to advance. But before you can do that, you must first deal with the patrols between you and the castrum.</target>

Your plan, as Alphinaud reminds you, will be to infiltrate the castrum and create a diversion, thereby allowing Lyse and her unit of Resistance fighters to proceed relatively unhindered to the fire control center. Weapons research is to be your destination, and one can only imagine what manner of foes await you there...

She makes no apologies for her actions and declares that all was in service to her countrymen─to secure a place for them within imperial society. Enraged, Lyse charges with murder in her eyes, only to find that her opponent possesses supernatural strength and agility. After effortlessly evading her attacks and cutting down Alisaie with a single stroke, Fordola dives through the window and makes her escape, but not before extending you and your comrades an invitation to the “royal hunt” on behalf of Zenos yae Galvus.</target>
