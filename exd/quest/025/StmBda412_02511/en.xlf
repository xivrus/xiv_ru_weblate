As prisoners of the tribe, you have been coerced into performing menial tasks as expressions of tribute. Lord Hien, for his part, has treated the whole affair as an opportunity to learn more about your rivals in the Naadam. Alas, it seems he and Lyse will not be allowed to take part in your next duty─to reconnoiter the encampment of the Dotharl.</target>

She can barely contain her disdain when she learns you are friends of the Mol, though she affords you some token respect after you tell her of your intent to fight in the Naadam. For saving her fellow tribesman's life, she grants you leave to enter Dotharl Khaa, and then turns to leave─but not before telling the still-bleeding hunter to see to his comrade's corpse.</target>
