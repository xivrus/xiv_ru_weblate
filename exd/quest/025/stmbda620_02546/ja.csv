Seeing this, Raubahn invites the two of you to accompany him to Coldhearth, a poor village of little consequence, which he reveals to be his childhood home. There he tells you of his life before the imperial occupation, when a soldier sent away from the front to mend first heard the words of a revolutionary firebrand...<br><br>Adrift in a memory of decades past, you observe Lyse's father deliver a speech to a crowd of cheering Ala Mhigans─among them, Raubahn Aldynn and Ilberd Feare, then dear friends. Afterwards, the revolutionary meets with Raubahn and counsels him to remember that freedom should not be an end in of itself, for it is but a chance to build something better...and the work is never finished.<br><br>""Liberty or Death,“ Raubahn repeats; the creed of Curtis Hext and his comrades. Solemnly, he asks Lyse if she will swear by these words, and she does so─though she is quick to add that the liberty she craves must be for every son and daughter of Ala Mhigo, even those who reject the cause. The nation they build must serve as a home for them all, she insists, and Raubahn can only agree.","TEXT_STMBDA620_02546_SEQ_01<tab>カストルム・アバニアをほぼ確保しながらも、アリゼーの負傷もあって、冴えない様子のリセ。ラウバーンの誘いでコールドハースを訪問し、彼女の父カーティスが残した言葉「自由か死か」の前で誓いを立てた。コールドハースの「ラウバーン」と話そう。","","False","0x00000001","",""
