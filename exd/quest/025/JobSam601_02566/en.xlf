While others branded him a craven for refusing to commit seppuku, she knew in her heart that he had a greater purpose, and your very existence has reaffirmed this belief. She goes on to reveal her reason for coming to Eorzea: to entreat Musosai's aid in fighting a faction of insurgents led by none other than his wayward pupil, a man named Ugetsu. However, this was not to be, and she takes her leave to return to her distant homeland.</target>

Sending you on your way, Momozigo asks that you pay him a visit every so often, lonely as it is without old Musosai around.
