Though Momozigo is incensed at the self-serving highborn, Musosai states that rumors are no basis for punishment, and proposes ascertaining the truth by speaking with denizens of the Brume.</target>

A fearful local informs you that your friend was asking him about the suicide when unknown men came and abducted him. It seems plain that there are those who take ill to your prying. With Momozigo's life potentially in peril, Musosai decides to confront Honfraint, who was recently seen in the vicinity of the Last Vigil.</target>

Racked by grief and guilt both, he confesses that his father, Lord Ydrancheux, had the young couple silenced when the girl inadvertently learned of his illicit dealings. And now Momozigo is about to be silenced in the same fashion. You must get to the Black Iron Bridge before your friend ends up at the bottom of the chasm.

Momozigo cannot help but wonder what it is that drives Musosai on, and suggests that perhaps the two of you might finish his duty for him. For now, however, there is little to do but wait and pray.
