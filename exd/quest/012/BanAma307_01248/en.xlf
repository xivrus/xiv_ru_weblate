Conversely, it is considered sacrilege for the weapons of the dead to be removed from their graves. Yadovv Gah has already seen to that dark deed; all that remains is for you to place the stolen weapons on display in Zahar'ak and show the Flamefangs that their fallen brothers have been disgraced.</target>
