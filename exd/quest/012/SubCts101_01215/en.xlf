        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS101_01215_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Lauriane's words are concerning, indeed. If the stranger she encountered in Gridania is to be believed, Haukke Manor─once cleansed of its demons by your own hand─now houses newfound horrors. Seek out your old acquaintance Ursandel to the northwest of the Lancers' Guild and see if there is any substance to the rumors.</target>

Set forth for the manor, that you might witness the horrors with your own eyes.</target>

His eyes darting wildly in fear, he spoke of a haunted mansion from which the tortured screams of young maidens can be heard day and night. Hawkett Manor, was it?</target>

Without witnessing my lady's remains for themselves, I was told, they could hardly vouch for the citizenry's safety. A prudent judgment, I thought, and I did not argue.</target>
