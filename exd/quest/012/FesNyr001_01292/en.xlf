The conversation was not without profit, however. Enter Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre and receive a souvenir from a certain uma bugyo from the Far East.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESNYR001_01292_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You learn that the Easterlings choose a totemic animal for every Heavensturn, and this turn is presided over by something they call the “horse.” A land almost beyond imagining is the East, where mounts &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;neigh&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, not &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;kweh&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. The uma bugyo presents you with a horse helm and bids you show the good folk of Gridania, Limsa Lominsa, and Ul'dah the spirit of this animal. No opportunity for professional development is unwelcome to the intrepid adventurer. Embrace your inner horse, or die in the attempt.</target>
