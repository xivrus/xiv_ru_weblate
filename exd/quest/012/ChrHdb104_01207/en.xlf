She mentions in passing that the man is also guilty of a crime, though she does not say what─only that she is curious how the inspector will act when he learns of this fact. For now, seek out the adventurer named Humphrey at the Golden Bazaar, and pray that Inspector Hildibrand somehow finds his way to you.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB104_01207_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;As usual, Inspector Hildibrand and Nashu arrive at the precise moment you locate Humphrey. To everyone's surprise, the self-proclaimed Warrior of Light claims to have defeated the duelist. His story is quickly disproven by an elderly man named Eleazar, who accuses Humphrey of surrendering an ancient sword he had been asked to deliver to a blacksmith for restoration. His bravado dispelled, Humphrey confesses to the crime and begs the assistance of Inspector Hildibrand. Although Ellie implores him to ignore the boy's pleas, the inspector agrees to help for Eleazar's sake. Assist Inspector Hildibrand by speaking with the residents of the Golden Bazaar.</target>

The matters at hand seemingly resolved, you begin to relax─only to whirl about in time to dodge a flying card, which embeds itself in the inspector's forehead. Upon the card is writ a challenge from the duelist: “I shall come to claim the collector's blade.” Inspector Hildibrand accepts, of course, with requisite grace and style, evoking a variety of reactions from all present.
