In order to ascertain what coaxed them into motion after several thousand years of stillness, there is no recourse but to forge onwards and upwards into the spire itself. Given the danger inherent in this proposition, however, it is agreed that no further forays should be made until Cid and his assistants have conducted an exhaustive analysis of the tower's next line of defense. Faced with the prospect of a lengthy delay, G'raha Tia warns you against idleness, doubtless anticipating that the challenges to come will punish any hint of rustiness in your technique.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Rammbroes.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_GRAHATIA_000_000&lt;tab&gt;The fellowship of NOAH being accounted for, it is time this assembly was called to order!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSD205_01203_GRAHATIA_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Rammbroes will be presiding over the meeting.

Short of leveling the place, this will almost certainly involve returning its mechanisms to a state of dormancy. To do &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;that&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, however, we will first need to address the question of how they work─the answer to which must surely be waiting for us inside the tower itself.
