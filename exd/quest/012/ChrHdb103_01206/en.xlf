Unable to determine precisely when and where the perpetrator struck, Inspector Hildibrand proposes that you retrace Yellow Moon's path on the day of the theft. To that end, speak with him outside the Sunsilk Tapestries shop on the Steps of Nald.</target>

This explanation fails to satisfy the enraged woman, who attempts to seize the deviants as they flee for their lives. Inspector Hildibrand congratulates himself on a job well done, and begins to explain how the three men were also responsible for the weapon thefts─only to be corrected by Ellie, a reporter for the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Mythril Eye&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, who reminds Inspector Hildibrand that the thief was also a duelist who defeated his victims in single combat. The reporter then offers to divulge the identity of one such victim, for which the inspector is tremendously grateful.
