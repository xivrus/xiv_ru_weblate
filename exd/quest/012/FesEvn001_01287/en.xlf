As Khloe Bajhiri of Gridania's &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;The Raven&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; tells it, Commander Vorsaile Heuloix insists that it is simply a Garlean diversion, but the savvy reporter is convinced that forces far more sinister are afoot. To answer her earnest plea, seek out proof of the otherworldly nature of the disturbances, that you might secure a scoop worthy of &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;The Raven&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;'s front page. Witnesses have sighted the supernatural storms in various locations: south of Fullflower Comb in the East Shroud, south of Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud, southeast of Horizon in western Thanalan, south of Forgotten Springs in southern Thanalan, northeast of the Foremast in middle La Noscea, and south of Costa del Sol in eastern La Noscea.

As the mighty mage herself explains it, an oversized golem of her creation went berserk, raining destruction upon the land with no rhyme or reason─though given that the construct's original purpose was to conquer Eorzea in its mistress's name, this could be seen as a fortunate turn of events.
