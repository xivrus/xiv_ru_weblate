By some strange coincidence, it appears that the Roegadyn engineer is also intent on purchasing what little aethersand there is to be had. After a somewhat one-sided negotiation, he relinquishes his questionable claim on the only available batch in exchange for a role in the forthcoming expedition. The fire-aspected aethersand thus secured, inquire as to whether Biggs might know where to obtain the three remaining varieties.</target>
