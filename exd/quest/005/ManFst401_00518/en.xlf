Before he can dispatch you to inform the authorities, Alphinaud Leveilleur strides into the church and declares Marques to be none other than Master Cid Garlond, who has been missing since the Calamity five years ago. While he has yet to recover his lost memories, Cid senses that the boy speaks the truth, and decides to join him. Resigned, Father Iliud produces Cid's belongings, which the priest had stored for safekeeping. Alphinaud then reveals that the Ixal have summoned Garuda, and that Cid's lost airship, the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enterprise&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, will be required if the surviving Scions are to reach the primal. Together with Cid and Alphinaud, make for Gridania, where the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enterprise&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; was last seen.</target>
