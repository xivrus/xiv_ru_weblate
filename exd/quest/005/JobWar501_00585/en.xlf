The siblings remain steadfast in their resolve to spread the teachings of their people across Eorzea, although Broken Mountain seems reluctant to take up the axe once more. Instead, he now pursues more scholarly studies─during which he has stumbled upon information regarding ancient martial techniques. If you would know more of such things, make your way to Camp Bronze Lake and speak with Broken Mountain.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBWAR501_00585_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Broken Mountain tells you of a legendary hero named Mythril Heart whose combat prowess is detailed at length in accounts he has discovered. Skeptical of their veracity, he sees no point in studying them further. However, Curious Gorge strongly believes otherwise, and even his old comrade-in-arms Wheiskaet seems to think there may be truth in them as well. Yielding to pressure, Broken Mountain states that he will reconsider his stance if you uncover proof that Mythril Heart was real. Recalling that the hero's final journey took him to Silvertear Falls, Curious Gorge suggests that you speak with the Sons of Saint Coinach, who conduct their research in Mor Dhona.</target>
