That was a heavy one. Still, there's no time to be hanging around─I better get asking after another job. Oh, hello there, &lt;var 08 E905 ((lass)) ((feller)) /var&gt;. You're one of those adventurers, ain't you? Say, if you've something needs delivering, I'd be happy to carry it.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="98" approved="yes"><source>98</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESVLT104_00527_LOVER00527_000_066&lt;tab&gt;...And those were her exact words? That's funny... It don't sound like anyone I know, and certainly not my sweetheart. Sorry, &lt;var 08 E905 ((miss)) ((lad)) /var&gt;, but I think you've got the wrong feller.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="99" approved="yes"><source>99</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESVLT104_00527_LOVER00527_000_067&lt;tab&gt;This is not the wagoner you are looking for.
