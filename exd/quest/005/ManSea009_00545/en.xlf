The tale triggers inside your mind a vision of the final moments of the Battle of Carteneau. When you subsequently come to your senses, you are surprised to find yourself in a room at the Drowning Wench, with no idea how you got there. Baderon, who apparently carried you back from the Bridge himself, explains that you collapsed, and mentions that the Admiral would like to see you. Make your way to Bulwark Hall, and request admission to the command room.</target>
