Much to your surprise, however, the smith reveals that there is yet work to be done─awakening sentience itself within your Zodiac Weapon. Indeed, it would seem the arms of legend consciously bonded with the soul of their bearers. Upon overhearing this, Jalzahn pledges to postpone his homewards journey. He posits that certain varieties of crystal can transfer a sense─a fragment of consciousness─via soul resonance, and thereby awaken the sentience slumbering within your weapon. To obtain these crystals, Gerolt tasks you with obtaining an introduction to Remon, a man of the black market, from Rowena in Revenant's Toll. Go now and speak with her.</target>
