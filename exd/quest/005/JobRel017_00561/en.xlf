Moreover, you discover that the author left as his legacy the title of “Starforger” to the person who could succeed in fully recreating a legendary arm of yore. Gerolt and Jalzahn, both desirous of this, allow their pride to tear them apart. Speak with Jalzahn now, to discover if the matter has been resolved.</target>
