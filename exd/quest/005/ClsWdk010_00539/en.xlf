However, the timbermaster fears that his friend is in dire need of assistance. Unable to grip a saw due to the injuries he incurred while rampaging through the workshop, he asks you to craft a quality crab bow and meld to it a grade three savage aim materia. Once you have prepared the bow, track down Gairhard in the North Shroud and see that he receives the help he needs.</target>

After sparing the briefest of thanks, he turns his attention to the Ixal and promptly slays their leader with a single arrow. Their forces in disarray, the Ixal are forced to retreat. Return to Gridania and inform Beatin of all that has transpired.</target>
