Wheiskaet and Curious Gorge have visited Camp Bronze Lake seeking volunteers, and have asked for you by name. Speak with Curious Gorge to hear what it is Limsa Lominsa requires.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBWAR580_00598_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Wheiskaet informs you that Maelstrom scouts have reported that kobolds of the 179th Order are tirelessly producing bombs in preparation for an all-out assault on Camp Bronze Lake. Maelstrom troops hope to intercept the bombs at Zelma's Run before they can do any damage, and Wheiskaet asks the aid of the two fiercest warriors he knows. Once again, Curious Gorge is afraid of his inner beast taking hold, especially in such a confined area, but Broken Mountain insists that this will be the ideal situation for Gorge to establish his dominance over the beast within. Curious Gorge asks to be alone and leaves, while Wheiskaet gives you the details of the Maelstrom operation. Speak with the despondent Curious Gorge once more before heading off to Zelma's Run and see if he can be convinced to join in on the fight.</target>

He admits that his brother is right, and that the correct path is plain, but can't seem to shake his fear of being overcome by the inner beast. He comes up with a last, desperate strategy: you must /slap him with all the strength you can muster, hopefully driving the cowardice from him for good.</target>

Ready your axe and speak with the Maelstrom troop at your assigned area, but be on the lookout for any signs of kobolds.</target>

The storm captain gives particular credit to Curious Gorge's ferocity in battle, and promises to give high praise in his report to Maelstrom Command. After the others return home, Curious Gorge tells you he was finally able to fight with abandon without succumbing to his inner beast. Nevertheless, he still doubts his own ability to maintain control in a more pitched battle. Curious Gorge returns to Camp Bronze Lake to rest, and asks you to give word of your victory to Broken Mountain upon your return.</target>

There is little time to consider the matter, however, as Wheiskaet brings news that Storm Marshal Slafyrsyn is seeking the aid of capable warriors to help defend Limsa Lominsa from the Sahagin menace. Broken Mountain suggests that if you were to succeed in this operation, it might lift the reputation of the warriors out of obscurity and into Eorzean history books. Continue your training in preparation for what promises to be the most critical test of your strength yet.
