At his further behest, you are to take the potions to the Coliseum and deliver them directly to Ardara, the expectant customer.</target>

Now mindful to not allow yourself to become too absorbed in your studies, you return to your mastering of alchemy.

※The next alchemist quest will be available from Severian upon reaching level 20.</target>
