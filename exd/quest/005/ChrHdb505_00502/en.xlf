        <target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB505_00502_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Ellie responds to you, but refuses to stand down, insisting that her quest for justice against those who wronged her homeland is more important than her and Cecy's very lives. A pack of zombies that she summons to attack are dispatched by Godbert and Gilgamesh, yet the undead legions keep coming. Just when you appear hopelessly outnumbered, a blinding light from on high heralds the arrival of none other than Inspector Hildibrand, with considerably more color in his cheeks than when last you saw him. Illogical as it may seem, it would appear that his own time spent in the company of the undead allowed him to develop an immunity to the Traders' Spurn. With the zombies now at the side of their erstwhile overlord, Ellie surrenders, bringing the case of the many-faced thief to an unexpected but satisfying end. Your work is not done, however, as the ever-enterprising Gilgamesh has taken advantage of the confusion to take into hand the Treaty-Blade, insisting that he will not relinquish the relic except to one who defeats him and his companion Enkidu at Amdapor Keep. Make for the South Shroud, and rendezvous with Hildibrand, whose legs have likely carried him to your destination well in advance.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB505_00502_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;Phillice and the others arrive at the scene, rejoicing at the news that the primal menace has been quelled, as Ellie and Cecy share the story of one last unsolved mystery: an incantation of Belah'dian legend whose great power can only be summoned forth by a Warrior of Light with the Treaty-Blade in hand. The conversation is interrupted by Hildibrand, who has successfully recovered that selfsame relic. The inspector, by mere coincidence, speaks something resembling the final words of the incantation, and─against all common sense─the Treaty-Blade responds, casting forth a brilliant beam of light that propels both blade and unsuspecting passenger into the heavens. A smile comes to Ellie's face, her dream of seeing the legendary power of her ancestors with her own eyes finally realized. Inspector Briardien is pleased to be rid of his incompetent rival, yet strangely moved by his inimitable gentlemanliness. Nashu and Julyan run off in search of the beloved inspector and son, as Godbert muses on the true calling of a Manderville man. Meanwhile, high above Eorzea, Hildibrand hurtles off to destinations unknown, as his keenly honed inspector's sense calls him to his next case. One can only hope that he will survive his inevitable landing with his memory intact...
