				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CLSALC200_00582_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You have been entrusted with the request of an arcanist, a man of whose name you are likely to remain ignorant should you be forced to rely on Guildmaster Severian's selective memory. Construct the materia-enhanced engraved hard leather grimoire and deliver it to your forgetful tutor. Yew logs, one of the materials required in the creation of the tome, must either be obtained through gathering, or purchased from the market boards of the Sapphire Avenue Exchange. And should you wish for a more patient explanation on materia, Severian suggests that you would be better served traveling to the Bonfire in central Thanalan and visiting the camp of the goblin Mutamix.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CLSALC200_00582_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You have delivered an engraved hard leather grimoire to Severian. Despite being left little choice but to visit the guild in person to collect his order, the arcanist seems overjoyed with the grimoire's quality. Bask in the warm glow of the client's praise as you nevertheless remain focused on upholding your new reputation as a “master alchemist.”

※The next alchemist quest will be available from Severian upon reaching level 25.</target>

Materia is the crystallized essence of a well-used piece of gear─the physical manifestation of an item's history with its wielder, if you will. It is not well understood exactly how these crystals work, but they have the effect of improving the properties of the objects to which they are attached.</target>
