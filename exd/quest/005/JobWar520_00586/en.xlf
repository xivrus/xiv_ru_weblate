As you land your final blow, your own inner beast rouses from its slumber with such ferocity that you lose consciousness momentarily. Afterwards, Broken Mountain forbids his brother from assisting you further in your quest, for fear of him losing control again. Though clearly distressed, Curious Gorge accepts his brother's judgment. Rest and visit Broken Mountain in Camp Bronze Lake when you are ready to continue your conversation.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBWAR520_00586_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Merely recalling your duel with Curious Gorge causes your inner beast to stir─a revelation which leads Broken Mountain to remember a passage he came across in his research: “Only the flames of animosity may temper a warrior's soul.” He interprets this to mean that the inner beast stirs when a warrior faces an opponent who pushes him to surpass his physical and mental limits, and that only in that moment can he attain mastery of new techniques. Believing this to be the means by which the heroes of eld achieved their legendary feats, he implores you to challenge yourself as they did.

※The next warrior quest will be available from Broken Mountain upon reaching level 54.</target>
