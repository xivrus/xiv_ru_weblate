				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESEST103_00559_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;The spriggan's words strike a chord with Motte. Jihli did not only dream of spriggans in the cities; she saw spriggans out in the wilds, too─dancing around giant, floating eggs, and trying to crack them open. Her Dreamers managed to track down the locations of these scenes, and found the very eggs Jihli dreamed of. Sylphic sorceresses have been dispatched to each location, to bring the scenes from Jihli's vision to life: to crack open the eggs, and win whatever prizes hide inside. Win a lucky egg by participating in the FATE “Gloria in Eggcelsis,” and give it to Motte. The FATE can be found at the following locations: southwest of Summerford Farms in middle La Noscea; east of the Salt Strand in lower La Noscea; south of Hyrstmill in the North Shroud; southeast of the Ul'dah Dispatch Yard in central Thanalan; and east of Camp Drybone in eastern Thanalan.

※To participate in the FATE, you must first be transfigured into spriggan form by the nearby sylphic sorceress.</target>

But as Jihli arrives to witness the crowning glory of her festival, so too does the auspicious spriggan, who is clearly not all he seems. Motte is forced into a confession: the events of the day were nothing but a drama staged by her and the other Dreamers. The auspicious spriggan, the Shellshockers, the treasure inside the lucky egg─all were false. At Jihli's angry insistence, Motte explains how the play was to end: she was to substitute the lucky egg's contents with a treasure map guiding Jihli to the Bismarck. By way of apology, Motte bids you come to the Bismarck too, to partake in the “wondrous treasure” that she and her accomplices have prepared. Speak to the one-eyed wretch in the restaurant to witness the unveiling.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESEST103_00559_SEQ_09&lt;tab&gt;You and Jihli arrive at the Bismarck to find that her Dreamers have organized a surprise nameday party for her. Jihli is moved to see so many well-wishers joining together to share the warmth of their hearts, and recalls the words the Archons of yore spoke unto her in her dream─how she was to follow a bearer of fortune and tour the wonders of the land, to overcome a grave peril and find a wondrous treasure. She realizes that the prophecy has indeed come true: she has overcome the peril posed by her friends' deceit, and gained the wondrous treasure of a closer understanding with her friends, and a renewed determination to make Hatching&lt;var 1F /var&gt;tide a day of great joy. The “bearer of fortune” can only be you: the one who has toured the land in pursuit of the treasure, and led Jihli to such a happy conclusion.

Sated with the night's revelries, you prepare to depart the Bismarck, but just as you are about to leave, you are called to a halt by Baderon Tenfingers, proprietor of the Adventurers' Guild. To your surprise, he congratulates you for saving the realm from imminent destruction. Unbeknownst to you or the Dreamers, the enormous eggs from Jihli's vision were actually Allagan doomsday devices, relics of the ancient empire that would have reduced Eorzea to ruins had they been left unattended. Realizing with some discomfort that it was luck alone that led to the weapons' discovery and deactivation, Baderon bids you never to speak of this knowledge to anyone, lest they live their lives in fear of what other unholy menaces sleep unnoticed beneath the soil.</target>
