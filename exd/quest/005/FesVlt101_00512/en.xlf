				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESVLT101_00512_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Lisette de Valentione and her band of loyal retainers have once again journeyed from Ishgard to bring the passionate spirit of their noble house's motto─&lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;ardor and affection&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;─to all Eorzea. However, in their efforts to aid those Eorzeans unable to confess their love in person, the party has met with an unforeseen obstacle that only an experienced adventurer can overcome. Lisette bids you speak with Hortefense, the man spearheading the mission, to learn more.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESVLT101_00512_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Hortefense explains how he and his emissaries have been tasked with delivering tokens of love in petitioners' steads. However, while the service was intended to aid those shackled by shyness, they have received requests from another, unexpected source: those who would gladly present their gifts directly, if only they knew where their loved ones were. Hortefense has pledged to locate these absent sweethearts, but as a stranger to these lands, he has thus far met with little success. Hence does he seek the assistance of learned adventurers to find these missing men, and ensure that no love goes unspoken this Valentione's Day.</target>

Ours shall be the wind that dispels these poisonous fogs, and sweeps every shrinking violet into the arms of their beloved!</target>
