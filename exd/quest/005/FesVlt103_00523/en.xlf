It seems Ser Hortefense's judgment was sound─you truly are a most discerning &lt;var 08 E905 ((lady)) ((gentleman)) /var&gt; indeed. Pray observe the fruits of your labor...</target>

My heart is afire to see such affection─whether through joy or jealousy, I know not...and care not! All that matters is that two more souls have found love this day─a love that could not have found its mark without your guidance.</target>

Ser Hortefense seeks a lady of the Ishgardian nobility, whom he met just once many years ago, and has been searching for ever since. Halone knows what such a lady would be doing all the way down here in Thanalan.</target>
