Now each one is intent upon adding you to its ranks, going so far as to send a representative to the Waking Sands to court you. Though Minfilia does not seem best pleased by this turn of events, she concedes that joining a Grand Company would yield certain benefits. But which one will you choose? That you might make an informed decision, she suggests that you attend the forthcoming remembrance services and listen to each Grand Company leader's address. Tataru will be able to furnish you with the particulars.</target>
