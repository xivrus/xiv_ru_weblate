Some years ago, he was gravely wounded in battle and left to die in a northern snowfield. And he would have done just that, had his life not been saved by a noblewoman of Ishgard─a lady he has searched for ever since. Perhaps Lisette de Valentione might have some inkling as to who the lady might be.

Hortefense is undeterred by her uncharacteristic lack of decorum, however, and the lady reluctantly allows him to remain in her company, provided they begin as friends and nothing more. With Hortefense's lost love discovered, and his long-unspoken ardor confessed, your duties as a laborer of love are finally complete.
