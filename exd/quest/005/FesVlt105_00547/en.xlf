        <target state="final">TEXT_FESVLT105_00547_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Amazed at your success in reuniting pining sweethearts with their lost loves, Hortefense entrusts you with his own petition. Some years ago, he was gravely wounded in battle and left to die in a northern snowfield. And he would have done just that, had his life not been saved by a noblewoman of Ishgard─a lady he has searched for ever since. Perhaps Lisette de Valentione might have some inkling as to who the lady might be.

Carried away by the excitement of rediscovering his lost love, Hortefense makes a surprise proposal, but is angrily rejected by Lisette. Hortefense is undeterred by her uncharacteristic lack of decorum, however, and the lady reluctantly allows him to remain in her company, provided they begin as friends and nothing more. With Hortefense's lost love discovered, and his long-unspoken ardor confessed, your duties as a laborer of love are finally complete. And while the world below basks in the warmth of passions both revealed and renewed, Countess Arabelle de Valentione smiles down from the heavens, her aims achieved for another year.</target>
