However, this year's event is to be no mere memorial, for Jihli has again been visited by the Archons: in her most recent dream, she saw adventurers in spriggan form following an auspicious spriggan, who guided them to a wondrous treasure. She bids you speak with her sylphic helper by the amphitheatre gates, so that you too might be transfigured into the shape of a spriggan, and bring her vision to life.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
