        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBGSC106_00576_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;After recognizing you as an accomplished jockey and trainer, a chocobokeep encourages you to consider arranging a covering for your veteran race chocobo. If all goes well, the offspring produced from the union would have the potential to become an even greater race chocobo─yet there is also risk involved, for you would need to retire an experienced chocobo first. Should you wish to learn more, speak with Katering at Moogle's Gift Mounts in the Central Shroud.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBGSC106_00576_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;While Katering states that she can make arrangements for a covering at any time, she reminds you that any newborn fledglings would need to undergo basic training prior to entering their first race. Thus acquainted with the process, you now stand at a crossroads: will you rely upon an established veteran chocobo, or will you seek greater glory through its offspring?</target>
