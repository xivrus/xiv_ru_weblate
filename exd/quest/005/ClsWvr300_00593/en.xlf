Even as Redolent Rose tries to warn the poor fellow that he's making a terrible mistake, the oblivious Lalafell bounds off to profess his love, leaving the guildmaster to comfort himself with the thought that the unwary lady may yet see past his friend's bizarre appearance. Quite why she would is another question...

※The next weaver quest will be available from Redolent Rose upon reaching level 35.</target>
