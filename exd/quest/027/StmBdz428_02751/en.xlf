If you were in my barbels, what would you do? Do you know of any path I can walk to quick wealth? Any at all?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="54" approved="yes"><source>54</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ428_02751_GYOFU_000_014&lt;tab&gt;A quick path to wealth? Hmmm...

Lupin turned looters prowl the place. Monstrous hounds called taoquan lurk in the shadows. There is no wealth to be had in death, Gyorin. No, no.
