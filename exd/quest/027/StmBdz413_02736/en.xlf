        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ413_02736_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Upon entering Namai, you are approached by a man named Fukudo. He tells you of the history of a family of Lupin that have long lived in the village, acting as its loyal protectors. However, what remains of the current generation of this family leaves something to be desired. Its strongest member having been recruited by the Garlean army, all that is left is a sickly mother and her powerless son, Kurobana. Fukudo asks if you would grant your succor to the young Lupin, hoping that he may become a capable warrior yet.</target>

Refusing to give up, you do your best to rally Kurobana's spirits.</target>

He heads off in search of an opponent and you follow, eager to see his strength, or lack of, for yourself.</target>
