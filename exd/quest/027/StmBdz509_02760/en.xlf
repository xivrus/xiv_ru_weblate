He explains that the Qestiri way is to show one's thoughts with actions in lieu of words─something the merchant is painfully unaware of. You head for the Qestiri khan's tent in search of the trader known as Gascot.</target>

Finally convinced talking will get him nowhere, Gascot agrees to leave the locals in peace and talk with you outside.</target>

Admitting the faults with his initial approach, Gascot asks if you would be willing to help him learn more of the area's customs.</target>
