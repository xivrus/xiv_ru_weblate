They have finally had enough of the beasts he continually reels in from the sea and insist that he quit fishing. He tries to argue that this will deprive him of a means to feed himself but no one─including his childhood friend, Koruri─is willing to listen. Nayoshi turns once again to you for aid. He asks that you soothe the mob of fishermen, starting with Koruri.</target>

The terms have been set and now Nayoshi must rise to the challenge. While terrified, and somewhat addled, he has not forgotten about your gift and asks that you meet him by the boulders that he might give it to you.</target>
