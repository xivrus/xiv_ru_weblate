When guests from the outside were invited into the palace to conduct a secret ceremony, Hisui had assumed the Ruby Princess's identity to prevent any danger from befalling the true heiress to the throne. As such, when proceedings took a dark turn, it was Hisui who became possessed by the void spirits that were summoned, leading to her current comatose state. Upon revealing this to you, Kurenai announces her intention to leave Sui&lt;var 1F /var&gt;no&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Sato for the upper world in search of a cure for Hisui. Shiosai, who has been ordered to stay behind, begs you go with her.</target>
