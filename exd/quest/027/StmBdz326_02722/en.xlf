According to one of the other villagers, the young girl nearly drowned and is currently in critical condition. Her body temperature is dropping fast, but the fire they made is not near hot enough to warm her. Nayoshi, however, has a solution: he will catch another fatty hooked bombfish and throw it in the fire. He, of course, will need you to accompany him to kill the beast he fishes from the sea.</target>

He believes Nayoshi's ability to catch hooked bombfish may be the key to reviving torch fishing and restoring the small fishing community to its former glory. It seems Nayoshi's dreams have come true: he can finally take up his fishing rod, and be lauded as Isari's greatest fisherman.</target>
