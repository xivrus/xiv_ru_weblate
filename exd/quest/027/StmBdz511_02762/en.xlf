        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ511_02762_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In light of Gascot's dance failing to capture the locals' hearts and minds, he suggests you try a different approach: improving his reputation with the other tribes first. Gascot believes advertising his wares in Reunion to a range of tribes will increase the demand for his goods, putting pressure on the Qestir to allow him to trade. You agree to help promote his goods to the Au Ra that have only recently come to Reunion.</target>

He explains that his tribe values hunting above all else and would have use for Gascot's foreign weapons. You are also told that the Qestir are in constant need of oil to keep the lamps of Reunion alight. In light of this, Jebei encourages you to retrieve a lump of fat from a steppe gedan and present it to Cotota as a gesture of goodwill.</target>
