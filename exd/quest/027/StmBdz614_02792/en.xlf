        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ614_02792_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Mauci has decided the best way to improve his own abilities is to study how you fight. He gathers some fatty meat from the village in the hopes of attracting a few Nhaama analas for you to slay. It does not take long for the creatures to approach and you promptly ready yourself for combat.</target>

He mentions that the village is hosting a practice tourney and that he will attempt to make use of what he has seen in it. You make your way back to Dotharl Khaa to monitor the boy's progress.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ614_02792_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Sadly Mauci is defeated rather easily by his opponent. He hopes this will go some way to convincing the villagers that he is not and never will be skilled with a blade, but everyone remains steadfast in their belief that he is of the Seven and Seven Swords. Another young Dotharl named Khulan decides she has had enough of the crowd's comments, admonishing them on Mauci's behalf. Khulan introduces herself as an old friend of Mauci's, asking if you would be willing to help her improve Mauci's current situation.</target>
