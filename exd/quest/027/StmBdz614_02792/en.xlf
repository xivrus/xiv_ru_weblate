He gathers some fatty meat from the village in the hopes of attracting a few Nhaama analas for you to slay.

He hopes this will go some way to convincing the villagers that he is not and never will be skilled with a blade, but everyone remains steadfast in their belief that he is of the Seven and Seven Swords. Another young Dotharl named Khulan decides she has had enough of the crowd's comments, admonishing them on Mauci's behalf. Khulan introduces herself as an old friend of Mauci's, asking if you would be willing to help her improve Mauci's current situation.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ614_02792_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Mauci and slay the Nhaama analas.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ614_02792_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Mauci.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ614_02792_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Mauci.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ614_02792_MAUCI_000_000&lt;tab&gt;You will help me after all?
