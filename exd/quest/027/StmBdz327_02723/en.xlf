One of the boats that went torch fishing the night prior has gone missing, and the villagers suspect it is the doing of the Kojin of the Red or sea monsters. As humble fishermen, however, they stand little chance of winning a fight against either and decide they must turn to outside help. One of the elderly fishermen reveals that, in the days of eld they would often turn to the Confederates for aid. Hearing this, Nayoshi asks that you introduce him to Tsukikage that he might appeal to him for assistance.</target>

The hostile Kojin, however, proved far stronger than he anticipated and he would likely have been overwhelmed by them had you not arrived when you did.

The Red Kojin attack has, however, raised a very important question among the remaining men and women: should their village give up on torch fishing for good? Just as the natives resign themselves to quitting, Tsukikage steps forward with a suggestion. In exchange for some of their bombfish oil, he will agree to protect their boats at night and even send men to help slay the beasts. Thus, an agreement is struck among the inhabitants of the Ruby Sea.</target>
