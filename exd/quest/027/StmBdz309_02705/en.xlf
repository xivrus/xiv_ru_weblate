While he starts to get a bit smart with you, it does not take long for him to recognize exactly who you are. Brushing it off as a joke, he then urges you to speak with a fisherman who comes to visit the island once a year. According to the pirate this man knows a great deal about faerie tales, and is currently docked at the Quickscape Pier.</target>

The grateful Kojin rewarded this man with the promise of an adventure and a vial of liquid that would allow him to breathe indefinitely underwater. Following him to the depths of the seas, the fisherman and Kojin traveled together, eventually coming across a princess who had been asleep for years in her palace. The Kojin, seeing this, produced another vial that instantly woke the princess. Hearing this story, Kurenai concludes the palace mentioned in the faerie tale is Shisui of the Violet Tides and would like to return to Sui&lt;var 1F /var&gt;no&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Sato to conduct further investigations.</target>
