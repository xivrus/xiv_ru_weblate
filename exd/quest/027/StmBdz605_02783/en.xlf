He, however, lacks mammoth meat─the Budugan's favored meat. Due to his standing within his tribe he is unable to ask the warriors to procure some for him, thus he turns to you with pleading eyes and requests that you bring back two mammoth carcasses. Once you are done slaying the beasts, he would like for you to come find him at the Bridge of the High Rule Warriors, where he will be training.</target>

He then reveals to you that he is of delicate constitution and even performing what seem like mundane tasks often leaves him short of breath. While disappointed in the results of today, he is not yet ready to give up. He then bids you to meet him at the Dawn Throne and bring the two mammoth carcasses with you.</target>

While he is disappointed by his own inability to conquer the swarm of vilekin that attacked him earlier, he intends to drown out his sorrows through cooking. He seems to have also come to the conclusion that instead of pursuing becoming strong it would be to the benefit of everyone for him to continue doing what he does best─providing good food.</target>
