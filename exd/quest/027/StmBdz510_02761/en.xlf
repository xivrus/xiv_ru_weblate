You agree to lend him a hand and question the Au Ra in Reunion on his behalf.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ510_02761_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Some of the locals are not especially keen to help when it becomes apparent you are assisting Gascot. However, you are still able to learn a few facts concerning Qestiri customs. Namely, that Reunion is a place where all Xaela put their tribal rivalries to one side to interact peacefully, and that the Qestir really do not ever speak.</target>

She initially seems confused by your approach, and just as you feel you are on the verge of a breakthrough, you are interrupted by none other than the blundering merchant himself. Gascot unleashes his interpretation of the Bomb Dance on his unsuspecting victims inside the khan's tent. Their response to this disturbance of the peace is unsurprisingly rather negative. Gascot bids you leave the area and regroup to consider just what went wrong.</target>

Regardless, he notes that the experience has at least taught him something about the local culture and he shall continue his endeavor to find a way of effectively expressing himself.</target>
