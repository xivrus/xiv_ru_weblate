One of the ingredients─the shell of a bloated yumemi─can no longer be procured, as the last of these ancient creatures was spotted decades ago. Nevertheless, you and the princess are undeterred. Announcing her intention to gather kelp, which was used to bait these giant mollusks, she bids you meet her at Exile─the erstwhile bloated yumemi hunting grounds.</target>
