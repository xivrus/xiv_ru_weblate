Despite being constantly told he is Mauci of the Seven and Seven Swords reincarnate, he cannot shake the feeling that he has no connection to the master swordsman. You agree to help him by asking the residents of Dotharl Khaa if Mauci is truly who everyone says he is.</target>

No other Dotharl were born the year the previous Mauci passed, and his poor swordsmanship is not enough to convince anyone that they could be wrong.</target>
