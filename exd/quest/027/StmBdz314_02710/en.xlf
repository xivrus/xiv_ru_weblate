These clumps of dying plants, if left unattended, will begin to decay and pollute our village waters.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="52" approved="yes"><source>52</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ314_02710_TAKOTSUBO_000_004&lt;tab&gt;The most effective way to remove them from the soil is to have the striped rays blast them with air bubbles.

Our plants begin to die off much faster now and as a result the bigger fish have far less smaller fish to feed on.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="58" approved="yes"><source>58</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ314_02710_TAKOTSUBO_000_013&lt;tab&gt;If things continue to go on like this, the marine life around us will eventually perish, and so too will our village. I believe that the striped rays will help us put off this decline, but the others are yet to be convinced of their value.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="59" approved="yes"><source>59</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ314_02710_TAKOTSUBO_000_014&lt;tab&gt;Either way, thank you for taking my striped ray out and helping tidy up the village.
