				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_STMBDZ604_02782_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Esugen, the Dawn Throne culinarian, is in quite the predicament. Halfway through preparing food to feed the hungry Oroniri warriors, he realizes he has forgotten to obtain a key ingredient─sheep's milk. Were he to go and fetch this himself, he would fall behind schedule and find himself at the mercy of fifty hot-blooded, hungry men. To prevent any delays in serving the food, he asks that you go and bring back the milk of three sheep for him. He then directs you to speak with Sorocan to do just that.</target>

Nevertheless, she allows you to proceed to the pen and collect sheep milk.</target>

Once he leaves, Esugen turns to you and reveals that as the weakest man in the village, he occupies the bottom rung in the Oroniri hierarchy. He, however, intends to become strong enough to rise from his lowly position, and asks that you help him with his cooking on occasion that he might find the time to train.</target>
