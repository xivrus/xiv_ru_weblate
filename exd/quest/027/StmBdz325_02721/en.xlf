He explains how shortly after he cast his line, a large fish took the bait. A violent skirmish ensued, and as he attempted to reel it ashore, he was thrown into his barrel. The impact caused him to drop his rod, which was pulled into the sea. Unable to dive into the waters to retrieve it himself, he once again appeals to you for assistance.</target>

She chides the fisherman, saying he must quickly dispose of the monster's remains before they start to attract other wild animals. Nayoshi decides to burn the bombfish using the broken barrel, but the wood is still slightly wet and sparks he strikes do not fully take. Seeing this, he tells you he will return to the village to retrieve dry planks and asks that you place the corpse into the cask while he is away.</target>

Nayoshi, however, seems indifferent to this observation and simply stares down sadly at the pile of ash, where he claims his unfulfilled dreams now rest. He then declares he will never again touch a fishing rod and will be leaving the village of Isari behind for good. While he seems determined, Koruri and you are left wondering if that is truly the answer...</target>
