        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ324_02720_KORURI_000_066&lt;tab&gt;...I actually came here to give you some advice. When you are fishing, you must shut down all your thoughts and concentrate solely upon seeing─nay, &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;feeling&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;─the great expanse of water that stretches out before you. Do it right, and the seas will guide you.</target>
