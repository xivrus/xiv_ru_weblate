However, even the khatun is not infallible, and Khulan is convinced she incorrectly identified Mauci as the reincarnation of Mauci of the Seven and Seven Swords. Mauci is frustrated by the continuing speculation regarding his identity and asks you accompany him to an area just outside Dotharl Khaa.</target>

The village's expectations of Mauci have clearly taken their toll on the young Dotharl. He states that he no longer cares if he is able to wield a sword, he just desires the strength required to feel he belongs to his tribe.</target>

Khulan is initially shocked to see you returned without Mauci, but calms down when she hears of recent developments. Now that it is clear Mauci is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, Khulan is positive that her friend is not who the khatun judged him to be. She asks you to continue to lend her your help, that you might discover the truth behind Mauci's identity.</target>
