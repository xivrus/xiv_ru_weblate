He has come to the conclusion that the Lupin boy might be suited to work which requires strength, but is not of an aggressive nature─specifically, transporting sacks of rice. Fukudo says he shall go inform his friend who monitors the rice storehouse of his idea and bids you talk to Kurobana.</target>

After watching Kurobana set off, rice sack in hand, Shirojishi bids you monitor his progress and encourage him if he tires on his way to his destination.</target>
