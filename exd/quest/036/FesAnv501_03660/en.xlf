She promptly extracts and reads the largely illegible missive, which appears to be writ with a grim prophecy. Concerned that another calamity may be impending, P'obyano pleads with you to deliver the letter to her friend Bran in Limsa Lominsa, a reporter for the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Harbor Herald&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; who specializes in such matters.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_FESANV501_03660_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;You present the mysterious missive to Bran, who immediately identifies the letter as having been penned by none other than a certain wandering minstrel of some renown, and the words themselves as having been excerpted from the seventh verse of Mezaya Thousand Eyes's &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Divine Chronicles&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;.

As he tells it, it actually dates back to before the Calamity, when the minstrel and his adventurer friends were endeavoring to spread the word about the impending destruction far and wide across the land. As for why it has found its way to you years later, however, he cannot say. Moved to song, he begins to play an ode on his harp, but the song has only begun when you are whisked away to a curious pocket of time and space. There, you are greeted by a man bearing an uncanny resemblance to the minstrel, who introduces himself by the unusual name of “Naoki Yoshida.” He thanks you for the countless heroic deeds you have performed in Eorzea, and shares with you his own feelings of deep fondness for the realm you call home. Leaving you with a cryptic message suggesting that his unseen companions also wish to share words of gratitude with you by other means, he bids you farewell. In the next moment, you find yourself regaining your senses beside Bran and the minstrel, who has just finished what─judging from Bran's reaction─appears to have been a truly memorable performance. After the reporter rushes from the scene to begin penning his latest and greatest story, you share a reflective moment with the minstrel as you watch a spectacular fireworks display in the heavens above the sultanate.
