        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX102_03690_UINNEE_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Oh, aren't they lovely? Vibrant blooms of all colors bursting forth from the intertwining branches─truly bountiful floral bouquets come to life! You've seen them ambling about here in Lydha Lran, haven't you?</target>

Were it not for one oh-so-small rub, that is. You see, they have an awfully nasty tendency to stomp on smaller creatures─not on purpose, I'm sure─and crush them under the mighty trunks that form their feet.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX102_03690_UINNEE_000_003&lt;tab&gt;That's when I got to thinking! I thought, why, all I need to do is weave a spell to bring them down to a smaller size! And so I did precisely that! Sadly, it worked &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;so&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; well that I didn't even notice when one of the tiny little creatures snuck away!</target>

You'll track my little creation down and bring it back to me, yes? Yes? And if it puts up a fight, don't hesitate to bash it on the head once or twice to remind it to behave!</target>

When the aroma attracted a curious little creepy-crawly, it completely forgot about the flower and chased the insect across the fields, where it saw &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;another&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; flower, and...why, it's as if it cannot keep its mind on a single thing for more than mere moments at a time!</target>
