In a bid to pique the interest of the reclusive mage of the palace, he proposes a boisterous entrance through the main gate. Though Alisaie seems unconvinced, Y'shtola concedes that besting the Nu Mou's familiars should serve to earn their attention. And so it is decided that you will enter through the front door, weapons in hand.

※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players.</target>
