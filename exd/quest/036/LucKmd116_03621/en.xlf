Still more hearteningly, she is eager to put her newfound abilities to good use, revealing that she senses the presence of a Lightwarden to the west. This coincides with Y'shtola's own suspicions after surveying a site known as Malikah's Well. Seemingly, the extensive underground waterway represents a suitable place to hide, and so that is where you will begin your search.</target>
