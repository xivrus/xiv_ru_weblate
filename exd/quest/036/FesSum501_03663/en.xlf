He heartily invites you to take part in the revelry yourself, which you may do simply by making your way to the seaside resort and speaking with Grand Chaperone Haermaga.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

The centerpiece is a trumped-up version of the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, which is complemented by two events of smaller scale, the Iron Culinarian Challenge and the Angling Extravaganza. He follows up his explanation with a request of a more specific nature, asking if you would be willing to provide some veteran guidance to a newly recruited adventurer who Haermaga suspects might be in over his head. Should you be willing to take on the job, speak to the grand chaperone whenever you are ready.</target>

No sooner has the lad introduced himself than does he challenge you to a battle to see which of you can accumulate four Faire vouchers in the fastest time. At Haermaga's behest, you accept his terms, in the hopes that you might impart to the boy a lesson or two along the way.</target>
