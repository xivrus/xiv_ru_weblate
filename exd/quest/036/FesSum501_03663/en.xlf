The centerpiece is a trumped-up version of the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, which is complemented by two events of smaller scale, the Iron Culinarian Challenge and the Angling Extravaganza. He follows up his explanation with a request of a more specific nature, asking if you would be willing to provide some veteran guidance to a newly recruited adventurer who Haermaga suspects might be in over his head. Should you be willing to take on the job, speak to the grand chaperone whenever you are ready.</target>

No sooner has the lad introduced himself than does he challenge you to a battle to see which of you can accumulate four Faire vouchers in the fastest time.
