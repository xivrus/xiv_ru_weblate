        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX004_03686_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Tyr Beq continues to be troubled by the possibility that An Lad might be the reincarnation of the previous Titania─and their friend. Assuming this is true, then the pale pixie carries the fallen faerie king's torment as if it were their own. Desiring to help An Lad, Tyr Beq heads into Lyhe Mheg to meet with the little boy you aided in Mord Souq, that you might learn what came to pass in his dream.

※You may enter Lyhe Mheg by speaking with Thon Sul in Lydha Lran.

Though the pixie's attempt to create water resulted in a nightmare, he is grateful nonetheless, for it served to remind him of his promise to his sister. Having recounted to you these events, the child returns to the waking world.</target>

However, she rouses before you can tend to her, and in distressed tones, reveals snippets of her past. It would seem a fire killed animals she considered her friends, a tragedy that gave rise to a fervent desire for approval. Comforted by Tyr Beq, she resumes her slumber, affording Ezel a chance to devour the nightmare. It is then that An Lad chooses to appear, but they do not linger long─and neither does Ezel, who rushes off to regurgitate the nightmare. You and Tyr Beq hasten after the familiar, ready to put your respective skills to use.</target>

She reveals that she has prophetic dreams, and foresaw the sin eater attack at Fort Gohn two years ago, but her warnings were ignored on account of her being a child. Made to feel powerless, she has since dedicated herself to becoming a respected priestess. Alas, the fear of failure always hounded her, and the recent onset of nightmares caused her to feel powerless all over again. She had just about given up hope when you vanquished the nightmare, thereby helping her be at peace with herself. Giving you her thanks, she takes her leave to resume her training with newfound positivity.
