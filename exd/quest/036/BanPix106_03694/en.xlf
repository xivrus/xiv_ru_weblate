Wait, you &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;were&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; a dreaming child once, yes? That's how it works, is it not?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Anyhow, let me guess: you loved to dream of going on grand adventures. Journeying to the bottom of the deepest waters! Braving perilous ruins in search of ancient treasures! Why, that's what &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;I'd&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; like to dream of if I were a mortal child!</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_002&lt;tab&gt;Yes, I do believe that settles it: something precious from the ruins of the House of the First Light should be just what I need to spin the most stirring and dramatic dream ever! And &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you're&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; going to bring it to me─for the children, of course!</target>

Only one of us has been a mortal child once, and it certainly isn't me! Anyhow, I'll leave it up to you. If I don't like what you bring me, I'll just send you back for more! Tee hee!</target>
