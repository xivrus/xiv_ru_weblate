Wait, you &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;were&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; a dreaming child once, yes? That's how it works, is it not?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Anyhow, let me guess: you loved to dream of going on grand adventures. Journeying to the bottom of the deepest waters! Braving perilous ruins in search of ancient treasures! Why, that's what &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;I'd&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; like to dream of if I were a mortal child!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="50" approved="yes"><source>50</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_002&lt;tab&gt;Yes, I do believe that settles it: something precious from the ruins of the House of the First Light should be just what I need to spin the most stirring and dramatic dream ever! And &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;you're&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; going to bring it to me─for the children, of course!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_003&lt;tab&gt;What sort of relic will make the children happy? Well, how should I know? Only one of us has been a mortal child once, and it certainly isn't me! Anyhow, I'll leave it up to you. If I don't like what you bring me, I'll just send you back for more! Tee hee!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="52" approved="yes"><source>52</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_010&lt;tab&gt;Ooh! You're back!

It doesn't sound nearly as fun as spinning dreams, but to each their own, I suppose.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="55" approved="yes"><source>55</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX106_03694_UINNEE_000_013&lt;tab&gt;A silver ring...?

They say that back in the days of the Kingdom, you could buy all sorts of things with these.
