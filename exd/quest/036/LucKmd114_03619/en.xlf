With both Thancred and Urianger also ready to set off, you have only to speak with Magnus to proceed.</target>

He duly insists you continue without him, that he might inform Alphinaud and the others of your progress. After a short farewell, the Talos is set into motion, and the trolley begins racing down the tracks. The gate to Nabaath Areng opens without incident, but an unwelcome sight awaits you on the other side─Ran'jit.</target>

After a moment's hesitation, you take Minfilia with you southward, the clang of steel ringing out behind you.</target>
