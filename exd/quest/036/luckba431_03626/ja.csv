"","TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_SEQ_01<tab>Taynor shares with you the memories that have finally returned to him. As the boy tells it, he and Nyelbert were born over a century ago as scions to a consortium of powerful mages, the leaders of which sought to master the art of opening portals to other worlds, that they might summon powerful entities from beyond. To that end, they were tutored in the arcane arts from an early age, their skills employed in dangerous experiments. One day, one of these experiments went awry, and Taynor was sucked into a rift between worlds, where he remained until you rescued him. Due to vagaries of travel between worlds largely beyond your comprehension, what felt like a relatively short span of time for the boy amounted to some one hundred years in the world he had left behind. Taynor shares with you another piece of fortunate news─along with his memories, he has also begun to recall the incantations he had learned─incantations which might serve you well in your confrontation with Phronesis. You and Cerigg set out for the Fields of Amber, where you intend to keep the boy safe as he puts his spells to the test.","TEXT_LUCKBA431_03626_SEQ_01<tab>テイナーが取り戻した記憶によると、彼は第一世界とは時間の流れが違う次元の狭間に閉じ込められていたことで、ナイルベルトとの時間のズレが生じたらしい。テイナーが「虚ろ」を今でも生み出せるのか、試してみることになった。アム・アレーンのアンバーフィールドで「テイナー」と話そう。","","False","0x00000001","",""
