Things take a turn for the unexpected when you hear a voice coming from beyond the hollow. At Cerigg's suggestion, you channel your aether into the gaping void to serve as a beacon, and are astonished to see a boy emerge from the other side. Unsure what to make of the situation, you decide to return to Mord Souq with Cerigg to tend to the frightened, ailing child.","","","False","0x00000004","",""

You resolve to continue to hone your skills and hope that the child soon wakes, and is able to provide you with the answers you seek.
