				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESSUM502_03664_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Haermaga thanks you for accepting the offer to help teach the overzealous R'fhul Tia an important lesson. He then lays down the rules: the first one to accumulate four Faire vouchers will be declared the victor. Faire vouchers can be won by successfully completing any of three events: the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, which will yield four vouchers, or the Iron Culinarian Challenge and Angling Extravaganza, which will yield one apiece. He further explains that you can take on any event as many times as you wish. With your objective clearly in mind, you set out to put on a clear demonstration of your adventuring abilities.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

After a short chat, he sends you out to look for R'fhul Tia, whose failure to return has the grand chaperone concerned.</target>

She mentions that she saw him talking to a particular personage standing a short ways away, and suggests that the two of you do the same in hopes of gleaning further information.</target>

He offers to provide a rousing play-by-play for R'majha's benefit, then proceeds to do exactly that as R'fhul Tia soars to the start of the course with great promise...only to fall to an inglorious defeat with his very first jump. R'majha runs off, worried that her brother might be hurt, and you decide to go along to offer what aid and emotional support you may.</target>

Mistakenly believing that he might yet win his competition with you, he grudgingly acquiesces to her request. Resolving to join them there, you begin thinking of how to break the news to the lad gently.</target>

His enthusiasm is somewhat dampened, however, when you tactfully inform him that, in fact, you have already obtained the necessary four vouchers and claimed your victory. Initially reacting with utter disbelief, he soon comes to the understanding that he had vastly overestimated his own abilities. Confronted with indisputable evidence that he still has a long way to go before becoming a true adventurer, he resolves to follow your advice and example. Promising his dear sister that he will be more cautious and circumspect in the future, he thanks you for providing him with inspiration and a valuable life lesson, and strikes out in search of his next adventure. Your job here done, you decide to return to Haermaga to report on the events of the day.</target>
