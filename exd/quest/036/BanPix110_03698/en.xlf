Well, then today's your lucky day! Simply speak to my friend Lugg Aenc, and they'll have you on the back of one of our fetching little familiars in no time! Doesn't that sound like fun?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX110_03698_LUGGAENC_000_010&lt;tab&gt;Greetings, friend! Do not worry─Uin Nee has already explained everything to me. You'll be taking one of our porxies out to harvest a healthy supply of nectar, correct? It really is too kind of you to volunteer for such a tedious task. In any event, I'm happy to afford you with one of my personal favorites.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX110_03698_LUGGAENC_000_011&lt;tab&gt;Are you quite all right? When the porxie returned alone, I'd worried that you'd taken a nasty fall. Good to see that you're still up and about─Uin Nee's getting terribly impatient about that nectar you promised them.</target>

You try not to think about how Uin Nee intends to extract said nectar from the innards of the little beast.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX110_03698_UINNEE_000_022&lt;tab&gt;Well, if you must know...I try not to think about that part. It gets a bit icky from time to time, you see. Why, there was one time when a porxie sneezed just as I was about to─yuck! On second thought, I don't think I'm thirsty anymore. Oh, why did you have to remind me about that!?</target>
