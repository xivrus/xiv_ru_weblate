Do not worry─Uin Nee has already explained everything to me. You'll be taking one of our porxies out to harvest a healthy supply of nectar, correct? It really is too kind of you to volunteer for such a tedious task. In any event, I'm happy to afford you with one of my personal favorites.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="52" approved="yes"><source>52</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX110_03698_LUGGAENC_000_011&lt;tab&gt;Are you quite all right? When the porxie returned alone, I'd worried that you'd taken a nasty fall. Good to see that you're still up and about─Uin Nee's getting terribly impatient about that nectar you promised them.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="53" approved="yes"><source>53</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX110_03698_SYSTEM_000_012&lt;tab&gt;The porxie inhales deeply, filling its nose─and one can only assume other parts of its inner anatomy─with sweet, sweet nectar. You try not to think about how Uin Nee intends to extract said nectar from the innards of the little beast.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="54" approved="yes"><source>54</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX110_03698_SYSTEM_000_013&lt;tab&gt;The aroma of sweet nectar wafts toward your nose. Unfortunately, you have no way of harvesting it on your own.

A porxie just came back with a belly full of the sweetest, most succulent nectar. I don't suppose you had anything to do with that, did you? In any event, I do hope you enjoyed your little flight!</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="56" approved="yes"><source>56</source><target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX110_03698_UINNEE_000_021&lt;tab&gt;Yes, I simply can't wait to drink deep of that sweet, sweet nectar!

It gets a bit icky from time to time, you see. Why, there was one time when a porxie sneezed just as I was about to─yuck! On second thought, I don't think I'm thirsty anymore. Oh, why did you have to remind me about that!?</target></trans-unit></body></file></xliff>
