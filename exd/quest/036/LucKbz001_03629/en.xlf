But as he lay dying, he cursed Branden's liege lady, the princess Sauldia, forcing the disgraced knight to grant her the mercy of death.

When she does eventually arrive, she does so clad in the armor of a warrior, and in the ensuing vision of her past you confirm that she was Cylva, the Shadowkeeper, sixth member of Ardbert's party and the traitor in their midst. After the vision fades, she goes on to reveal that she is of the Thirteenth, another shard that long ago fell to Darkness, and in so doing set the First on the path to a mirrored fate, from which its countless souls could only be saved, she believed, through the most drastic of measures. She labored in secret to groom young adventurers that they might become Warriors of Light, thus shifting the balance of the world and priming it for a Rejoining. However, in failing at the last, she instead set the stage for the Flood of Light. For a century her essence lingered, a shade seemingly trapped in a purgatory of her own making. However, when she learned of her fallen comrades' rebirth as Virtues, she set about making plans for their destruction by gathering brave souls to hunt the simulacra with the aid of the chosen hero that would one day arrive: you. Now that her comrades have been lain to rest, she yearned to consign her soul to oblivion and sought death at your hand, but your response drove her to consider what other ways she might atone for her terrible deeds...</target>
