The familiar suggests inspecting Lyhe Mheg for anomalies, and while there, taking the opportunity to check on the little girl in Slitherbough.

※You may enter Lyhe Mheg by speaking with Thon Sul in Lydha Lran.

She then reveals that she too met with An Lad in her dreams. Seeing the pale pixie's loneliness, she tried to reach out to them, only to end up being caught in the nightmare. Having learned all that you could, you and your companions reconvene.</target>

To that end, you turn your attention to the task of reopening the fifth gate, which you deduce leads to Il Mheg, where the source of the nightmares is none other than An Lad themself. At that moment, Tyr Beq finally succumbs to sleep. While the pixie rests, Ezel suggests asking the fae folk about the previous Titania, the better to understand An Lad's heart.</target>

Though at first annoyed by your prying, the pixie is gladdened that their departed friend hasn't been forgotten. Tyr Beq explains that, in the past, when no one else wanted anything to do with them, their friend alone accepted them as they were. This reminiscence sparks an epiphany, and they believe that An Lad simply wants for someone to do the same for them. Thus it is decided that you will enter Lyhe Mheg, there to find and save the tormented pixie.</target>
