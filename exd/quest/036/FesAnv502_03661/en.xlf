Scour the beach for these mysterious missives, and bring what you find back to her, that she might share with you the contents.

※There are eighteen unique messages to be read in all, divided amongst three varieties of bottles. There are six unique messages contained in small bottles, seven messages contained in medium bottles, and five messages contained in large bottles. The letters housed in small and medium bottles will be chosen at random. Those in large bottles will vary depending on your progression through the main scenario.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
