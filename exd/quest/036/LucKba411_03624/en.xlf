        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKBA411_03624_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Cerigg appears pleased to inform you that Phronesis has been sighted in the area, allowing the investigation to begin in earnest. He explains his plan, which involves employing a manikin to trail the sin eater and observing from afar, that he might gauge just how wide of a berth must be kept from the hollows to avoid being sucked into the void. But first, the dilapidated manikin must be restored to a functional capacity. You agree to fetch the tendon of a sandskin sibilus from the Fields of Amber while Cerigg procures other essential parts.</target>

The unfortunate automaton's sacrifice having gleaned you useful knowledge, you draw within a safe distance of the hollow to investigate further. Things take a turn for the unexpected when you hear a voice coming from beyond the hollow. At Cerigg's suggestion, you channel your aether into the gaping void to serve as a beacon, and are astonished to see a boy emerge from the other side. Unsure what to make of the situation, you decide to return to Mord Souq with Cerigg to tend to the frightened, ailing child.</target>

There are numerous questions he would ask, but for now intends to see that the child is healthy and nourished. You resolve to continue to hone your skills and hope that the child soon wakes, and is able to provide you with the answers you seek.
