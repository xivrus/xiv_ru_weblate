But don't worry─I'm not going to do anything like that today! Today, I'm going to tell you a story. A story of moss fungus, and of children.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_001&lt;tab&gt;Moss fungus often grows on graves, and because of this, Kholusians believe it to be a most baleful thing, and a harbinger of death, disease, and all sort of other nasty things. Because of this, many children have nightmares of being chased after by giant moss funguses! Is it moss funguses?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_002&lt;tab&gt;Anyhow, this got me thinking. Wouldn't it be &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;so&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; sweet if &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;someone&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; put these poor dreamers' hearts at ease by bringing me the cap of a slain moss fungus, that I could spin it into a dream to show the children that there's nothing to fear about these funny-looking creatures?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_003&lt;tab&gt;I'm not asking you to do this. Heavens no! I'm merely saying that &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;if&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; someone were inclined to perform this kind gesture, all they would need to do is take an oh-so-short trip to Sextuplet Shallow and rip the cap off one of the unsuspecting moss funguseses that live there. Don't worry, though─I'm sure my dreamers won't mind living in abject fear for another day or two.</target>

Once upon a time in a mortal kingdom that is no more, people would sometimes play little tricks on those they didn't like by sneaking a teensy-weensy bit of moss fungus poison into their drinks every day.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX109_03697_UINNEE_000_013&lt;tab&gt;Guess what would happen then? The poor person would gradually grow sick and eventually die, and nobody would be the wiser! That's quite the trick, don't you think? Why, I wish I'd thought of it myself! By the way, can I interest you in a sip of water before you go? Tee hee!</target>
