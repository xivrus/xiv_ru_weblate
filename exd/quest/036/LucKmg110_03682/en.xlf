In a series of visions from the dragoon's recent past, you bear witness to the murder of Emperor Varis; a grueling battle with Zenos himself; and an encounter with a mechanical monstrosity bearing a striking resemblance to the Ultima Weapon. When you eventually return to your senses, Estinien presses on with his report, concluding at length that the Empire poses no threat for the present, though it remains to be seen where Zenos will next resurface. His contract with Tataru thus fulfilled, your old friend gruffly takes his leave to the disappointment of all present.</target>
