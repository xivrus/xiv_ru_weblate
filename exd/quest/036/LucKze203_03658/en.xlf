				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKZE203_03658_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Just when this tale of serpents and soothsaying seemed ready to end, Quinfort is struck by an epiphany. The peculiar form of the great serpent, he claims, is an omen of the coming calamity, its stripes representing the currents which carry the Greatwood's life force. Looking once more at the serpent's scales, he feels confident that their pattern resembles Lozatl's Conquest. He bids you go there and search for any potential clues as to what danger the future holds.

With a little effort, you uncover what appears to be a strange container sealed with talismans. You return to Slitherbough hoping either Valan or Quinfort will know what it is you found. </target>

He now fears they may use them to siphon the life energies of the Greatwood while supplying themselves with deadly force. Though his claims seemed absurd at first, Quinfort has yet to be wrong so far as Valan can tell. Perhaps the great serpent really is the key to their salvation.</target>
