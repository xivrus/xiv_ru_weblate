Though his tone makes it difficult to tell whether his gratitude is sincere or if his offer to meet a magical “associate” is simply a means of luring you into some sinister snare, there is only one way to find out.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
