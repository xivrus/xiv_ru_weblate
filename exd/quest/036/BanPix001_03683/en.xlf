        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX001_03683_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Strolling through the Pendants, you chance upon a pink pixie named Tyr Beq. Though you can make little sense of what they say, it would seem some unsavory individual is causing people to suffer from nightmares. Out of concern for your fellow man, you decide to lend the pixie your aid, and together you set forth for Sullen to rendezvous with another ally.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX001_03683_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Joining Tyr Beq in Sullen, you soon encounter the ally, a prodigious porxie familiar. Introducing itself as Ezel II, dream devourer extraordinaire, the familiar reveals it has been investigating the nightmares. The culprit, it believes, is a certain pixie bereft of color, who has the power to manipulate dreams directly─something which, Tyr Beq remarks with alarm, should only be possible by one who is the equal of Titania. At this juncture, noticing your deepening confusion, Ezel II bids you follow it─hopefully to a place of some clarity.</target>

However, no sooner does it gulp down the last of the unholy meal than everything threatens to come back up. It is then that the colorless pixie appears before you. This An Lad reveals that they were the one who planted the nightmare within the child. In a stroke of quick thinking, Tyr Beq uses their power to give corporeal form to the regurgitated nightmare; it now falls to you to vanquish the abomination.</target>

However, these gates were recently sealed off by An Lad, who desires to control the dreams of those mortals who share their torment. By your recent victory, Tyr Beq senses that their hold over the gates has weakened, and they urge you to reach out to the Lakeland gate while holding an image of the region in your mind.</target>
