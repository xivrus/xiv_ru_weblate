Moreover, they can be thrown from a distance, making the task surprisingly risk-free. So risk-free, in fact, that Chai-Nuzz volunteers to do the deed himself. He still requires support, however, lest he run afoul of the local wildlife. To that end, you set out for the Quick Way in search of a vantage point from which to warn him of danger.</target>

After a few adjustments, they spring back to life, and he sends them marching off in the direction of the city.

At the end of a tiring trek through Kholusia, you arrive in Gatetown to find the Talos have attracted a crowd. Among them, you spy Lady Chai, who is near speechless at the sight of her husband. She duly rushes over to him, wasting no time in showing him the strength of her affection. A strength which renders him briefly unconscious.</target>
