A plan to sever all flows of aether to Slitherbough, which would not only cripple the village but irreparably upset the balance of the forest. Despite the difficulty involved in explaining where they learned of this plan, the two have every intention of informing their betters. Quinfort once more offers praise to the great serpent, but he turns to find it vanished. Though the mystery of this snakelike being remains, they are content in the knowledge that the Greatwood is safe.</target>
