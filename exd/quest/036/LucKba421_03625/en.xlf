Cerigg sent him for a stroll around town to see if it might help to jog his memories, and encourages you to check in on him. Track down Taynor and see if he has met with any success in piecing together his past.</target>

Cerigg further explains that according to the carer who examined him, the boy apparently possesses considerable magical powers. Drawing the conclusion that he doubtless has a master or tutor somewhere out there, the bounty hunter proposes speaking with a traveling merchant in town to see if anything might be gleaned as to your young friend's origins.</target>

Once the boy is gone, Cerigg, dismayed at the unfortunate turn of events, proposes entrusting Taynor to the care of another so that the two of you might return to hunting Phronesis─and continue the search for Taynor's family in the process.

Convinced now that your young companion is the key to vanquishing the dread Phronesis, Cerigg has a change of heart and proposes that the two of you officially take him in. Taynor welcomes the offer, thanking the two of you profusely for your kindness and promising that he will lend you whatever aid he can. For your part, you resolve to further hone your command of the magical arts while waiting for the lad's memories to recover further.
