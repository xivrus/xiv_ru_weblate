A prodigy of the arcane arts, he has the gift of clairvoyance, but Valan fears it has become more of a curse. His fellow Blessed ignore his claims that Quinfort's behavior is out of the ordinary, prompting him to seek the opinion of an impartial party. To that end, he asks you to speak with Quinfort to assess his condition.
