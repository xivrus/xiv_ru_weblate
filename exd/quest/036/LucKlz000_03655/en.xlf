The Mean is composed of five facets, each a collective of folk skilled in certain areas, who work together to provide for the Crystarium. There is the Facet of Forging, whose members are experts in metalworking; the Facet of Crafting, which brings together artisans who work with leather, cloth, and wood; the Facet of Nourishing, which strives to ensure that denizens are fed and healthy; the Facet of Gathering, formed of miners and botanists who procure resources all across Norvrandt; and the Facet of Fishing, whose members fish the realm's waters and cultivate marine life. Every facet is always looking to bolster its roster with new talent, and Katliss encourages you to make yourself known to whichever one is a fit for your skills.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLZ000_03655_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Katliss.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLZ000_03655_SYSTEM_100_001&lt;tab&gt;In order to undertake this quest, you must first complete the sidequest “Inscrutable Tastes.”</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLZ000_03655_KATLISS_000_001&lt;tab&gt;You look like you've got skills of the sort we need.

From daily necessities to military provisions, we deal in just about anything. A storehouse and workshop rolled into one, we are.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="55" approved="yes"><source>55</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLZ000_03655_KATLISS_000_052&lt;tab&gt;Now, the Mean is composed of five facets─that's our fancy name for divisions. Each facet is a collective of folk skilled in certain fields, who work together to provide for the Crystarium.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="56" approved="yes"><source>56</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLZ000_03655_KATLISS_000_053&lt;tab&gt;Firstly, there's the Facet of Forging. As you can probably glean from the name, its members are experts in metalworking. The woman you see there is Iola, the proprietress of the Iron Bellows. I'm told she's been sorely pressed for help lately.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="57" approved="yes"><source>57</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLZ000_03655_KATLISS_000_054&lt;tab&gt;Next, we have the Facet of Crafting, which brings together artisans who work with leather, cloth, and wood. Among them, there's even a lass who specializes in the restoration of artwork and traditional handicrafts. She doesn't appear to be present at the moment, though.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="58" approved="yes"><source>58</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLZ000_03655_KATLISS_000_055&lt;tab&gt;Moving on, we have the Facet of Nourishing, whose mission is to ensure that our denizens are fed and healthy─and I speak not only of people. Bethric there is the resident veterinarian, and he's charged with looking after our trusty amaro.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="59" approved="yes"><source>59</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLZ000_03655_KATLISS_000_056&lt;tab&gt;Then there's the Facet of Gathering, formed of miners and botanists who procure resources all across Norvrandt. Overseeing the group is Qeshi-Rae, a knowledgeable─if eccentric─woman. If you have an inquiring mind like her, though, I daresay you'll get along.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="60" approved="yes"><source>60</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLZ000_03655_KATLISS_000_057&lt;tab&gt;Last but not least, the Facet of Fishing. Aside from reeling in the bounty of the realm's waters, members also cultivate marine life. Frithrik there speaks for the gathering, and whatever folk may say of his leadership, none can doubt his skills and knowledge as a fisher.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="61" approved="yes"><source>61</source><target state="final">TEXT_LUCKLZ000_03655_KATLISS_000_058&lt;tab&gt;And that's the five facets of the Crystalline Mean.
