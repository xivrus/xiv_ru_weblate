It is revealed that he was chosen to be lord overseer of the project, and thanks to his influence, you are given an exemption from requiring a work permit. Having informed you of his plan to survey the citizens to learn what they envision for the Firmament, he asks for the pleasure of your company before setting out for the Jeweled Crozier, where he expects to find a diverse assortment of people.</target>

It is then, as he is expressing self-doubt, that Edmont makes an unannounced appearance, and thanks to the retired count's sage advice, Francel finds a way forward once more. After Edmont takes his leave, you are introduced to a fellow named Augebert, the chief foreman of the project, with whom you may speak for directions on-site.
