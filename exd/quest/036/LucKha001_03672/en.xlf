It is revealed that he was chosen to be lord overseer of the project, and thanks to his influence, you are given an exemption from requiring a work permit.

After Edmont takes his leave, you are introduced to a fellow named Augebert, the chief foreman of the project, with whom you may speak for directions on-site.
