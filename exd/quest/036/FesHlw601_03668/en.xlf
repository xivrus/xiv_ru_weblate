        <target state="final">TEXT_FESHLW601_03668_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You speak with the Adventurers' Guild investigator, who is─not for the first time─keeping a mistrustful eye on the Continental Circus, a troupe dedicated to celebrating All Saints' Wake. He reasons that, as its members are known to be voidsent fiends in disguise, the troupe must be up to something...though he admits he hasn't a clue as to what that might be. He asks that you inquire with the Impresario directly as to this year's events and ascertain what might be suspicious about them while he continues to skulk about the periphery.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone.</target>

The source of said disruption is the troupe's voidtamer─who has discovered that the Circus ahriman has gone missing and is taking it rather personally. The Impresario requests your assistance in tracking it down, and as you certainly have no other investigative leads, you head to the Central Shroud to search.</target>

A mysterious pumpkin-headed personage is having some success in comforting it─until the Impresario and troupe voidtamer appear and she vanishes into the shadows. Upon your fixing him with an annoyed glare, the Impresario remarks that you would be a suitable instructor for the ahriman, which must learn to utilize its dread gaze to fearsome effect if it is to perform its role in the Circus. This may as well happen, at this point, so you agree to try your hand at training it.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESHLW601_03668_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;The Circus ahriman casts its somewhat less-than-dreadful gaze upon three adventurers in the Shroud. Though it fails to inspire more than mild surprise, it does serve as a festive reminder of All Saints' Wake, prompting all of them to dash off to celebrate the holiday. Were the Continental Circus's goal actually as straightforward as encouraging seasonal revelry, rather than terrorizing the populace to bring about the return of the Night of Devilry, you imagine the ahriman would make an excellent member of the troupe.</target>

However, for what is likely a multitude of reasons at this point, it conveys that it would rather stay at your side instead.
