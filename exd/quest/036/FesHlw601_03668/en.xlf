He asks that you inquire with the Impresario directly as to this year's events and ascertain what might be suspicious about them while he continues to skulk about the periphery.

Upon your fixing him with an annoyed glare, the Impresario remarks that you would be a suitable instructor for the ahriman, which must learn to utilize its dread gaze to fearsome effect if it is to perform its role in the Circus.
