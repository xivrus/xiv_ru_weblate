As per Beaudefoin's instructions, propel yourself up to the starting line by hopping on the nearby water spout, then carefully make your way across a series of precarious platforms to reach the midway point. When you arrive, be sure to report to the chaperone stationed there before proceeding on to the finish.</target>
