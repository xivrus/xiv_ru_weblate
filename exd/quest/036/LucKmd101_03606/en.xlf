Any theories as to their provenance will have to wait, however, as Alphinaud arrives to inform you that several anchors around the city must be activated before the protective barrier that serves as its primary defense can take effect. This process is best completed sooner rather than later, so you and Alisaie agree to assist.</target>

The Leveilleur twins, having arrived to witness the scene with you, indicate that your next destination will be the battlefield in the Lakeland wilds, where Lyna and her people are already engaging the eater host.</target>

Though your group is able to save many, you find yourself witness to death at every turn.
