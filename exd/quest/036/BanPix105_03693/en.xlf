        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Well, if it isn't my favorite mortal! And do you know &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;why&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; you're my favorite? Why, it's because you have a knack for showing up &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;precisely&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; when I need something done. Like now, for example!</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANPIX105_03693_UINNEE_000_001&lt;tab&gt;You see, I've asked a Nu Mou crafter to craft me a delightful new toy to bring to the children in their dreams, and I promised I'd repay them with something very, very special─an echevore tail, to be precise!</target>

You can smell them or sip from them, and they have the taste and aroma of sweet, sweet honey! A bit &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;too&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; sweet for my liking, to tell the truth, but the Nu Mou just can't seem to get enough of them.</target>

The sweetest of the sweet echevores can only be found distressingly close to the stamping grounds of those oh-so-nasty Fuath. Just imagining being gripped in those slimy, slippery, slobbery hands makes me─ick! Why did you make me think such unpleasant thoughts!?</target>

We pixies have &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;far&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; more refined palates than those silly Nu Mou. We're not ones to sit around all day sucking on these icky tails!</target>
