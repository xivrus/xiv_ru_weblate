And do you know &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;why&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; you're my favorite? Why, it's because you have a knack for showing up &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;precisely&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; when I need something done. Like now, for example!</target>

You can smell them or sip from them, and they have the taste and aroma of sweet, sweet honey! A bit &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;too&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; sweet for my liking, to tell the truth, but the Nu Mou just can't seem to get enough of them.</target>

The sweetest of the sweet echevores can only be found distressingly close to the stamping grounds of those oh-so-nasty Fuath. Just imagining being gripped in those slimy, slippery, slobbery hands makes me─ick! Why did you make me think such unpleasant thoughts!?</target>
