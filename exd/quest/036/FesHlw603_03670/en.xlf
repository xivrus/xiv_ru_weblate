        <target state="final">TEXT_FESHLW603_03670_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Upon inquiring as to what the investigator's other concerns regarding the Continental Circus might be, he explains that he has cause to believe that would-be attendees of their masquerade are being spirited away to another location entirely─and that said location is fraught with fiends and other dangers. He requests that you, in the name of public safety, infiltrate this apparently haunted manor to ensure that no victims have been trapped within.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

She also cautions, however, that you had best understand the rules to the extent that your mundane consciousness allows if you intend to survive it...</target>
