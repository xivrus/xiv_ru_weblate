His father hints at a tragedy that befell his daughter, but he is reluctant to talk about the incident in detail. When the man departs on an errand, Ezel proceeds to devour the boy's nightmare, prompting An Lad to appear once more. The pixie sternly warns you against further interference before leaving you with more cryptic words. Ezel then flies off to find a suitable place to be sick and you hurry after, ready to strike down the nightmare given form.</target>

Your victory over his nightmare has allowed him to find peace, but as he leaves, you are surprised to hear him give thanks to a pale pixie.
