He is searching for a companion to aid him─and, in turn, share in the bounty─and suggests that you might be up for the task. Meet him at the Red Serai in Amh Araeng if you have a mind to take up the offer.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_LUCKBA401_03623_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Cerigg shares with you the specifics of the sin eater Phronesis and its preferred method of attack. As he tells it, the sin eater does not confront its foes directly, but rather wreaks havoc via something people call “the hollows”─compact dimensional portals conjured out of thin air that swallow up everything around them. With your arcane knowledge, he hopes to devise a means to counteract this phenomenon, thus opening up a line of attack to the sin eater itself. Exercising due caution, he promises to do the necessary research before attempting to approach the fiend itself. You resolve to continue to hone your command of the magical arts until such time as Cerigg is ready to proceed to the next phase of his plan.

※The next role quest will be available from Cerigg upon reaching level 72 in any magical ranged DPS class.</target>
