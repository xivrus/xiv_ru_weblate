However, he becomes somewhat sidetracked by the matter of his and Jeryk's absent companion─a subject on which you are quite well-informed, having roundly trounced the man but recently. It is decided that Jeryk will attend to him while Thaffe escorts you to town.</target>

Thaffe then gives you a brief history of the town and its troubled state at present─a state which he, curiously enough, suggests to be reflected in Magnus, the man whom you are here to meet. Though some trepidation upon hearing such an unflattering description may be unavoidable, there is little you can do but follow through on your plan to speak with him.</target>

Though you get the sense that larger issues are at play in his reticence, his stubbornness gives you no choice but to withdraw for the time being.</target>
