You have no time to explain or persuade him otherwise, and are forced to fight Jenlyns and his soldiers. Defiant to the bitter end, Jenlyns refuses to believe your pleas of innocence, until one of his own men attempts to take his life. However, Solkzagyl suddenly appears and saves the captain's life, and the man once believed to be a traitor reveals that he has always been loyal to the crown. Although Jenlyns loses consciousness due to his injuries, Solkzagyl assures you that it is nothing serious, and he pledges to deliver him safely back to Ul'dah. Nevertheless, you should see if Jenlyns is well when next you return to the city.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD451_01059_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Jenlyns has accepted that he was an unwitting dupe of the Monetarists.
