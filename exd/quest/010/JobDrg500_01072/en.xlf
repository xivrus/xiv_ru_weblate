Your virtuous spirit and mastery of the lance, however, prove more than a match for your adversary, and the being of darkness vanishes from sight, taking the fallen dragoon with it.

Though concerned for Estinien's fate, Ser Alberic is heartened by your accomplishments, which give him newfound hope for the future. Until such time as the great wyrm wakes again, go forth as the Azure Dragoon and use your newfound strength in the name of justice.
