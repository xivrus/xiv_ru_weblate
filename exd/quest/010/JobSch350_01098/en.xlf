				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBSCH350_01098_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Ever the dedicated academic, Alka Zolka has deciphered a significant portion of the Nymian treatise, much of which pertains to scholars. He notes that the Soul of the Scholar should have imparted to you a far more diverse repertoire of spells, and concludes that the cause may be your faerie's fifteen-hundred-year slumber. Surmising that exposure to familiar sights may kindle lost memories, he suggests that you visit the ruins of ancient Nym in outer La Noscea.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBSCH350_01098_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Based on the reactions of your faerie, Alka Zolka concludes that each is a distinct individual with her own thoughts, feelings, and memories─an exciting discovery, to be sure, but not the sort Alka Zolka set out to make. Determined not to let your accomplishments overshadow his, he redoubles his efforts to unearth new stratagems.

※The next scholar quest will be available from Alka Zolka upon reaching level 40.</target>
