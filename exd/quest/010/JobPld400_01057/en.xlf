The recovery of the sword will be very difficult, and Jenlyns pledges to teach you more of the paladin arts to prepare you for the fight. For that purpose, he bids you test your might against the lepidotes dwelling within the waters of the Yugr'am River in eastern Thanalan.</target>

※The next paladin quest will be available from Jenlyns upon reaching level 45.</target>
