The events at Wineport drained his soul crystal of its vibrance, causing the armor to deny him its powers, lest his soul in its weakened state be devoured. Your mentor, having feared such a possibility, left the breastplate where it lay. While he has more confidence in &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;your&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; ability to control it, he would make certain you are prepared before seeking it yourself.

Thus did each of them carve his own place in history.
The chronicles go on to say that years later, prior to death, each of the pupils returned to the scene of his own greatest victory, and buried the artifact in his possession in a final attempt to prevent any one warrior from holding the set. And it is there that the pieces still rest.</target>
