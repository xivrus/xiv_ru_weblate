Jenlyns is hoping that your skills in battle will help him recover the sword, which has been passed down through generations of Sultansworn captains. To that end, he pledges to teach you more paladin skills and assigns a new task. You are to journey to outer La Noscea and defeat a host of leaping ringtails in order to further hone your skills.</target>

When they marched by, the smallfolk would look upon them with reverence and gratitude. And no one was more respected than the captain. My predecessor.</target>

My father had promised to take me to a local festival, but somewhere he took a wrong turn. We became lost and stumbled into a secluded back alley. Luck was not with us, because the next moment, we found ourselves in the middle of a riot. Drunken hunters were firing arrows into the crowd, and we were caught between them. There was no way out─it was only a matter of time before we would be struck...</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBPLD350_01056_JENLYNS_000_004&lt;tab&gt;That's when the captain saved us from our plight. I'd never seen a sword move so swiftly! It flashed faster than my eyes could follow, and in seconds the hunters were on the ground or fleeing for their lives. The captain was gone down the street, slicing at their heels, before my father had time to thank him. Even today, I can see the captain as he was then, blood on his sword, armor impossibly bright in the sun.</target>

I would practice endlessly with my sword, dreaming of bandits defeated and monsters slain. Even after I became one of the Sultansworn, the memory of the captain still inspired me─I was always the first to arrive in the training yard, and the last to leave.</target>

Yet the triumph was hollow, because by then, the honor of the Sultansworn elite, that very thing that had drawn me to the brotherhood, was a mere vestige, like the discarded banner of a defeated foe.</target>
