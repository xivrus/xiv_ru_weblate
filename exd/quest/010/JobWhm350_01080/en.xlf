        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBWHM350_01080_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The process of pacifying ireful trees involves communing with the elementals that dwell within, such that a state of harmony might be restored. As the next stage of your training as a white mage, Raya&lt;var 1F /var&gt;O&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Senna would have you pacify a small tree in the northwest area of Sorrel Haven.</target>

Soothing their anger and restoring harmony to the forest is the duty of the white mage─a duty she feels transcends race or nation. She would ask that you continue to hone your skills while she thinks of a way to persuade her brother, A&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Ruhn&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Senna, that you are the right &lt;var 08 E905 ((woman)) ((man)) /var&gt; for the job.

※The next white mage quest will be available from Raya&lt;var 1F /var&gt;O&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Senna upon reaching level 40.</target>
