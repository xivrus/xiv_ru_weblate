        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH300_01097_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Alka Zolka's interest in history is a practical one, as he seeks to research the military tactics of Nym, an ancient civilization said to have repulsed would-be invaders time and time again. He had hoped that an arcanist might help analyze any text pertaining to magical arts─that is, if he were in possession of any texts to translate. Alas, the Nymian tablets he purchased were stolen en route to Limsa Lominsa. Journey to the Raincatcher Gully docks in eastern La Noscea, where he suspects the thieves may be found, and help him recover his stolen relics.</target>

However, Alka Zolka had not anticipated the appearance of an otherworldly creature, one which seemingly burst forth from a crystal you found with the tablets. Hastily translating one of the tablets, Alka Zolka explains that the creature is a faerie, one which once served as the companion of a Nymian scholar. Ask the shocked marauder what he would like to do next.</target>

Reasoning that an experienced arcanist would be in a better position to preserve the lost arts, he decides to entrust the crystal to you. Do your utmost to gain mastery over your newfound powers as the marauder continues to decipher the ancient tablets.
