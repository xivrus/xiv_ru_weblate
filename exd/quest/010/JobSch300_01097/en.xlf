He had hoped that an arcanist might help analyze any text pertaining to magical arts─that is, if he were in possession of any texts to translate. Alas, the Nymian tablets he purchased were stolen en route to Limsa Lominsa.

However, Alka Zolka had not anticipated the appearance of an otherworldly creature, one which seemingly burst forth from a crystal you found with the tablets. Hastily translating one of the tablets, Alka Zolka explains that the creature is a faerie, one which once served as the companion of a Nymian scholar.
