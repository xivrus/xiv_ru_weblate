        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH400_01099_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The time has come at last to revive the Nymian tradition of marauder and scholar fighting side by side. A tonberry has been sighted in Bronze Lake, and Alka Zolka would have the two of you slay it. To further tempt you into accepting his request, he states that the experience may rekindle the memories of your faerie, as he theorizes that tonberries once plagued the people of Nym. Rendezvous with Alka Zolka outside the Wanderer's Palace so that you might hunt the creature together.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH400_01099_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Finding the tonberry was surprisingly easy. Slaying it, however, was not. As Alka Zolka prepared to deliver the final blow, your faerie inexplicably came to the tonberry's defense, providing it with ample time to escape. Do what you can to console the downcast Alka Zolka.</target>

Even so, he politely requests that you strive to gain greater control over your faerie so the incident does not repeat itself.
