While he continues his search for the missing traitor, Jenlyns assigns to you another trial. You must seek out the four pieces of the gallant armor, which have been scattered throughout southern Thanalan. The coffers containing each piece will be guarded by the Sultansworn, whom you must first defeat if you are to claim the armor.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_002&lt;tab&gt;Around the time the traitor Solkzagyl was named captain, several famed soldiers of the Sultansworn met with untimely deaths. But strangely, our records do not say how they died.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_003&lt;tab&gt;Curious, I begged the favor of an old friend and received permission to inspect medical records kept by Frondale's Phrontistery. I discovered that the soldiers died in various ways─some in combat, some suddenly at night, in the barracks... But in nearly every case, there were signs that poison had played a role in their demise.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_004&lt;tab&gt;Yes, poison. Carefully, invisibly administered. The more I read, the more I saw the dark hand of Death's Embrace at work─assassins in the pay and service of the Monetarists. A society so secretive that few believe it truly exists.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_006&lt;tab&gt;So I asked myself: who had the most to gain from their deaths? One by one, the former captain, his trusted aides, the most capable of the Sultansworn who might become future commanders─all of them, slain by an invisible hand. And with their deaths, the way was open for Solkzagyl to become the Sultansworn's youngest captain in a century.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_008&lt;tab&gt;Which begs the question: how did Solkzagyl remain captain for thirty long years? How did he avoid the poisoner's kiss, when men better than him had succumbed? There can be only one explanation─he was the Monetarists' cat's-paw, the turncloak in our midst.</target>
