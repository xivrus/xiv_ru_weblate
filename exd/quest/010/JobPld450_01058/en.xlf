I have important news for you. In my search for the traitor, I have been looking through old records─and discovered something chilling.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_002&lt;tab&gt;Around the time the traitor Solkzagyl was named captain, several famed soldiers of the Sultansworn met with untimely deaths. But strangely, our records do not say how they died.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="50" approved="yes"><source>50</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_003&lt;tab&gt;Curious, I begged the favor of an old friend and received permission to inspect medical records kept by Frondale's Phrontistery. I discovered that the soldiers died in various ways─some in combat, some suddenly at night, in the barracks... But in nearly every case, there were signs that poison had played a role in their demise.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_004&lt;tab&gt;Yes, poison. Carefully, invisibly administered. The more I read, the more I saw the dark hand of Death's Embrace at work─assassins in the pay and service of the Monetarists. A society so secretive that few believe it truly exists.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="52" approved="yes"><source>52</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_005&lt;tab&gt;But no matter how skilled and devious the assassins, they should not have been able to kill so many of the Sultansworn elite without being discovered. Not, that is, without help from within our own ranks.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="53" approved="yes"><source>53</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_006&lt;tab&gt;So I asked myself: who had the most to gain from their deaths? One by one, the former captain, his trusted aides, the most capable of the Sultansworn who might become future commanders─all of them, slain by an invisible hand. And with their deaths, the way was open for Solkzagyl to become the Sultansworn's youngest captain in a century.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="54" approved="yes"><source>54</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_007&lt;tab&gt;The Monetarists were plotting to kill the best and bravest of the Sultansworn, to purge its ranks of greatness, and enervate it so that it could no longer carry out its duty to serve as sword and shield of the sultanate.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="55" approved="yes"><source>55</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_008&lt;tab&gt;Which begs the question: how did Solkzagyl remain captain for thirty long years? How did he avoid the poisoner's kiss, when men better than him had succumbed? There can be only one explanation─he was the Monetarists' cat's-paw, the turncloak in our midst.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="56" approved="yes"><source>56</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBPLD450_01058_JENLYNS_000_009&lt;tab&gt;Needless to say, I am more determined to track him down than ever before.
