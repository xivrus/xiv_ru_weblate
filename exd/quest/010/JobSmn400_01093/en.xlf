Though she uncovered little more than an outdated military registration and a name─Tristan─the researcher was also able to track down one of the man's old war comrades. Travel to Little Ala Mhigo, and speak with the former Immortal Flame.</target>

※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra upon reaching level 45.</target>
