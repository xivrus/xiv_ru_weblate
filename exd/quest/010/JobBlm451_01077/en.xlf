He holds a stone tablet passed down to him from his ancestor Da Gu. Upon showing it to you, the light from your Gem of Shatotto reveals writing carved into its surface indicating that closing the voidgate requires certain &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;garb&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. To locate three of the pieces, pour the blood of Kazagg Chah into the planar fissure at the Zanr'ak encampment in southern Thanalan, the blood of Dozol Meloc into the planar fissure at the Ixali logging grounds in the North Shroud, and the blood of Da Za into the planar fissure at O'Ghomoro in outer La Noscea.</target>
