For the showdown, he has chosen Snowcloak in Coerthas─but before you can offer your assistance, he commands you to stay away and find a safe haven. Jenlyns also mentions that Solkzagyl wishes to speak with you, and the captain directs you to a tunnel in central Thanalan where Solkzagyl will be waiting.</target>

Together, the three of you manage to defeat the assassins and deal the Monetarists a crushing blow. Afterwards, despite the captain's objections, Solkzagyl leaves the Sultansworn in Jenlyns's hands and returns to his paladin's journey. Return to Ul'dah, find Jenlyns at his station near the Royal Promenade in the Hustings Strip, and talk to him once more.</target>

In recognition of your deeds, he bestows upon you the gallant surcoat, sacred armor normally reserved for the most courageous of the Sultansworn. Although this is a violation of long-standing tradition, he believes there is no paladin more deserving of the honor. Wear your new armor with pride, free paladin, and continue to defend the people of Eorzea.
