Its roots can be traced back some five hundred years, to when our nation was still in its infancy. It was around that time that a precursor organization to our own was established to facilitate communion with the elementals...</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CLSHRV999_00193_LEONCEAULT_000_33&lt;tab&gt;The Twelveswood doesn't belong to man, but almighty beings known as elementals. It is by their leave that we Gridanians dwell here in the forest, and it is by their leave that we receive of its bounty.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CLSHRV999_00193_LEONCEAULT_000_34&lt;tab&gt;Ever since mankind settled in the Twelveswood, it has been necessary for us to obtain the elementals' permission prior to taking aught from their domain. Historically, this was a rather involved process in that only a precious few could actually commune with them─specifically, those conjurers blessed with the ability to hear the elementals, aptly known as Hearers.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_CLSHRV999_00193_LEONCEAULT_000_35&lt;tab&gt;In order to relay the elementals' will to the botanists in a more timely manner, a new organization was formed with a Hearer as its mouth and ears. This organization would eventually evolve to become the Botanists' Guild.</target>

Yet this is no longer our organization's sole concern. We also seek to promulgate correct harvesting practices─that is, practices which honor the will of the elementals.</target>

Well, you may cast such doubts aside. You don't need to have been raised as a good little forestborn &lt;var 08 E905 ((girl)) ((boy)) /var&gt; to be a botanist, nor do you need to know the secret forestborn salute─&lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;I jest&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;─you just need a healthy respect for nature and the will to learn.</target>
