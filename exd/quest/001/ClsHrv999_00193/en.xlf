        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSHRV999_00193_LEONCEAULT_000_34&lt;tab&gt;Ever since mankind settled in the Twelveswood, it has been necessary for us to obtain the elementals' permission prior to taking aught from their domain. Historically, this was a rather involved process in that only a precious few could actually commune with them─specifically, those conjurers blessed with the ability to hear the elementals, aptly known as Hearers.</target>

This organization would eventually evolve to become the Botanists' Guild.</target>

Well, you may cast such doubts aside. You don't need to have been raised as a good little forestborn &lt;var 08 E905 ((girl)) ((boy)) /var&gt; to be a botanist, nor do you need to know the secret forestborn salute─&lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;I jest&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;─you just need a healthy respect for nature and the will to learn.</target>
