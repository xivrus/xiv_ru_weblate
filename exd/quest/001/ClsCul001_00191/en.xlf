The city's rich culinary tradition is the product of a unique combination of factors. The first is our proximity to the fertile lands and plentiful seas of Vylbrand, which have ever yielded bounteous produce.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="61" approved="yes"><source>61</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL001_00191_CHARLYS_000_23&lt;tab&gt;The second is our standing as the realm's foremost trading port, which grants us access not only to exotic ingredients from faraway shores, but also to foreign merchants versed in their use. We are, in short, the beneficiaries of culinary knowledge from every corner of the world.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="62" approved="yes"><source>62</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL001_00191_CHARLYS_000_24&lt;tab&gt;Until recently, knowledge of this kind was passed on solely through word of mouth, and was therefore susceptible to corruption and loss. But that all changed when one man made it his mission to catalog every recipe of note. His name was Admiral Guolskyf Bhaldwaensyn, also known as Mastcleaver.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="63" approved="yes"><source>63</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL001_00191_CHARLYS_000_25&lt;tab&gt;The man's love of fine cuisine was such that, at sea, he would regularly spend as much time preparing meals in the galley as giving commands on the bridge. It was none other than he who founded the Culinarians' Guild and codified cooking methodology.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="64" approved="yes"><source>64</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL001_00191_CHARLYS_000_26&lt;tab&gt;Today, the guild carries on Bhaldwaensyn's legacy, though the scope of our endeavors has expanded significantly.

If you earnestly believe that you can, speak to me once more, and I shall be glad to guide you through the enrollment process.</target></trans-unit></body></file></xliff>
