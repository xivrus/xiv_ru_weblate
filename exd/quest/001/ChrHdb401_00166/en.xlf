With my plan to out the thief at Miss Arabella's wedding proving a rousing success, we were &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;this&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; close to defending the treasure from the clutches of the many-faced fiend. But even the best-laid plans of inspectors extraordinaire are wont to go awry, and our phantom quarry successfully absconded with the so-called Maiden's Virtue. With no rest for the weary agent of enquiry, I have ventured to the Coliseum to begin my preliminary search of the environs. This time, I swear on the Manderville name, the phantom thief shall meet his match!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
Ellie believes she has identified the thief's next target: a priceless treasure set to be awarded to the winner of the Mythril Cup, a tournament scheduled to be held at the Coliseum in the coming days. She informs you that her colleague Ganelon is in Ul'dah as you speak, researching for a feature on this very event. Travel to town and see what the reporter might tell you.</target>

It would seem that many of the scheduled combatants for the Mythril Cup have withdrawn due to injuries sustained under curious circumstances, leading to suspicions of foul play. Speak with the gatekeeper Yuyubaya to gain entrance to the Coliseum, that you might further question the relevant parties.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB401_00166_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Upon arriving at the Coliseum and speaking with the organizer, one Dour Meadow, you soon reunite with a certain gentleman inspector and consulting detective, with the rivalry between the two as heated as ever. With a mind to keep the prizes out of the hands of the thief, you enter the tourney at Inspector Briardien's behest, submitting your application to the tentacled receptionist known by the name of Ultros. Fearing for your safety now that you have declared your intention to fight, Ellie suggests that you return to Ganelon and seek out more information on the shady attacks against potential combatants.</target>
