However, she is willing to waive the fee this one time, and even “dispose” of the ring free of charge─which absolves you of your debt to the Ossuary, but does nothing for Didilata.</target>

And such a gaudy, poorly wrought one! Also, you &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;do&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; know that our appraisals are not free? Normally, this fee is subtracted from the agreed value.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBWIL002_00151_MAMANE_000_8&lt;tab&gt;Alas, considering the negligible value of this ring, I'm afraid you would still owe us. However, since this is a rather unusual circumstance, we shall waive the fee this once. No need to concern yourself with the bauble─I will personally see to its disposal.</target>
