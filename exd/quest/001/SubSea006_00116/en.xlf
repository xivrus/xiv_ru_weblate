Anyroad, you can get lamb easily enough by hunting the lambs that graze outside the city. Go through the Zephyr Gate and follow the path east and south for a bit. You'll run into the fluffy─and tasty─critters before long.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBSEA006_00116_HLAHONO_000_22&lt;tab&gt;'Tis times like this I feel fulfilled in my role. I used to be a chef myself, you see, but my skills weren't quite up to par. So when the Bismarck expanded operations, I asked to be made its provisioner instead. This way, I can still be part of the business in spite of my shortcomings.</target>
