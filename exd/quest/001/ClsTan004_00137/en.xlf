        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSTAN004_00137_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In order to gauge your aptitude for materia melding, Geva instructs you to prepare a pair of materia-enhanced goatskin leggings. Though the aldgoat leather and cotton cloth you require are common in Thanalan, you need not travel to the sultanate to procure them. However, such a trip may be warranted if you know nothing of materia, as a goblin scholar living in central Thanalan is said to be an authority on the subject. Prepare the requested item and deliver it to the guildmaster.</target>

However, she still doubts your understanding of the leatherworker's craft, and demands that you redouble your efforts to hone your skills. She also mentions that, were you to improve beyond all recognition, you &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;might&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; be eligible to contribute some work to the annual exhibition─though such lofty goals are yet far off.

※The next leatherworker quest will be available from Geva upon reaching level 25.</target>
