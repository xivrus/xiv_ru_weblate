She explains that a recent drop in productivity has left them scrambling to make ends meet, and asks to see your magitek armor in the hopes of drawing inspiration for a new product.

While at first taken aback by the sleek design of your suit, she is inevitably disappointed by the damaged weaponry. Unable to bear seeing good steel go to waste, she insists you gather parts so that she may begin repairs immediately. Make your way to Castrum Centri and retrieve a magitek converter #49, magitek oscillator #50, and magitek cannon barrel #51 from the Empire's storage crates.</target>
