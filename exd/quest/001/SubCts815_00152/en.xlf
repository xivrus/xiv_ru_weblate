Looking to receive his wares as soon as possible, Syntgoht asks that you speak with Nesting Heron at the Bonfire in central Thanalan.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Arriving at the Bonfire, you speak with Nesting Heron and are reassured to find that the shipping preparations for Syntgoht's goods are complete. The reason for the delay, she explains, is her preoccupation with a crafting phenomenon known as desynthesis. After explaining the basics of this process and going over the discovery of a new crafting catalyst called demimateria, she encourages you to try desynthesis for yourself, that you might discover the latent potential of previously crafted wares.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Nesting Heron at the Bonfire.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_SYNTGOHT_000_000&lt;tab&gt;For Twelve's sake, what living am I to make without wares to sell?
