        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You overhear Syntgoht thinking aloud, worried over a shipment of goods that has yet to arrive. It's not long before he is aware of your presence, and, after sensing the air of gallantry about you, presumes you to be an adventurer who can assist him in his time of need. Looking to receive his wares as soon as possible, Syntgoht asks that you speak with Nesting Heron at the Bonfire in central Thanalan.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBCTS815_00152_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Arriving at the Bonfire, you speak with Nesting Heron and are reassured to find that the shipping preparations for Syntgoht's goods are complete. The reason for the delay, she explains, is her preoccupation with a crafting phenomenon known as desynthesis. After explaining the basics of this process and going over the discovery of a new crafting catalyst called demimateria, she encourages you to try desynthesis for yourself, that you might discover the latent potential of previously crafted wares.</target>

Because the process is similar to the creation of materia, we've come to call these crystals “demimateria.”</target>
