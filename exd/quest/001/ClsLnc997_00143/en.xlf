However, your moment of triumph is cut short by the appearance of the rogue lancer whom you encountered back at the guild. The sneering spearman, who introduces himself as Foulques, proceeds to declare your prize a counterfeit before challenging you to find the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;true&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; stone, which he claims to have secreted in the depths of Spirithold. It would seem a trip to the abandoned dungeon is in order...</target>

Contradicting Foulques's claim that courage can only be forged in the midst of great danger, the guildmaster reminds you that a lancer's courage is the product of composure and resolve. It is these qualities, and not blind daring, that he would have you keep in mind as you continue your training.

※The next lancer quest will be available from Ywain upon reaching level 15.</target>
