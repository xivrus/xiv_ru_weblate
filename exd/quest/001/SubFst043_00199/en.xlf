Q'djawana is yet to settle on a method to prevent the malmstones from becoming substitute nests, but thanks to your efforts the problem has been forestalled for a short while at least.</target>

With all the chores that need doing around here, I was afraid they would be left to get even filthier. It's not just that they're an eyesore, by the way─in that state, the creatures around here are wont to lay their eggs on them.</target>
