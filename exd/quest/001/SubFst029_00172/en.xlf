I caught a scurry of squirrels gnawing on the fences earlier. I managed to drive them off, but not before they decided to gnaw on &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;me&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; instead! And now I'm the bloody mess you see before you.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBFST029_00172_AROLD_000_2&lt;tab&gt;To make matters worse, I find myself without so much as a single hi-potion. I know, I know...foolhardy. I vaguely recall using my last one after some trifling scrape several moons past... The gods alone know why I didn't think to replace it there and then. You wouldn't happen to be carrying a spare flask?</target>

I thought I had seen everything, but it seems there are still surprises to be found in the Twelveswood. We both would do well to remember that.</target>
