I caught a scurry of squirrels gnawing on the fences earlier. I managed to drive them off, but not before they decided to gnaw on &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;me&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; instead! And now I'm the bloody mess you see before you.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBFST029_00172_AROLD_000_2&lt;tab&gt;To make matters worse, I find myself without so much as a single hi-potion. I know, I know...foolhardy. I vaguely recall using my last one after some trifling scrape several moons past... The gods alone know why I didn't think to replace it there and then. You wouldn't happen to be carrying a spare flask?</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="50" approved="yes"><source>50</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBFST029_00172_AROLD_000_3&lt;tab&gt;If you don't have any on hand, the merchant at the Bannock should have some in her stock. I can't leave my post, so if you could bring me a hi-potion, I'd be tremendously grateful.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_SUBFST029_00172_AROLD_000_10&lt;tab&gt;Seven hells, did those accursed squirrels leave any part of me untouched?
Ah, you're back!

I thought I had seen everything, but it seems there are still surprises to be found in the Twelveswood. We both would do well to remember that.</target></trans-unit></body></file></xliff>
