But buildin' ships is a bit harder than knockin' out simple helms, which led those armorers who were good enough to work on boats to claim the title o' “shipwright.” 'Course, it was one thing callin' armorers blacksmiths an' shipwrights armorers, but it was quite &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;another&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; callin' shipwrights blacksmiths, 'cause buildin' a ship an' makin' a hatchet couldn't be more different.</target>
