It appears an amaro has devoured a porxie familiar, and its Nu Mou owner is none too pleased. The suspicion for the crime soon falls upon Tonatiuh, who is ignorant of the ways of Il Mheg. While Sandman has words with his own to make certain the culprit isn't among them, he bids you speak with the aggrieved Nu Mou for their account of the incident.</target>

At your suggestion that the culprit was likely an amaro from outside Il Mheg, and not a creature of Wolekdorf, the Nu Mou demands you find and bring Tonatiuh to them for questioning. The young amaro is likely to still be close to the scene of the crime, somewhere in Voeburtenburg.</target>
