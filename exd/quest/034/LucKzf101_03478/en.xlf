Despite her sister's reservations, Phyna explains how the ceremony is carried out. Namely, that it ends with a test of strength against a manifestation of the forest's spirit, which then carries their prayers to the heavens when defeated. They begin their prayers to summon forth a spirit, but the ritual goes awry. No sooner do they end their incantation than not one, but two volatile spirits of opposing elements appear.</target>
