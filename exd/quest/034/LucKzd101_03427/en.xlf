        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZD101_03427_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Drawn by enchanted crystals that call to those amaro that have awakened to their kind's long-lost abilities, a young beast has come to Il Mheg. However, he was not prepared for the existence of others like him, and no sooner was he welcomed by Sandman than he bolted and ran. Having been among men until recently, Sandman believes that the startled creature will trust you, and thus are you tasked with finding and bringing him back to Wolekdorf.
