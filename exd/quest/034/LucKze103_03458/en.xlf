        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZE103_03458_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Callea shares with you the incident that has been weighing on her mind. It would seem that while you were making arrangements for her lodgings at the Crystarium, a young soldier was carried to the infirmary in dire condition, suffering from a most virulent poison inflicted upon him by a roving beast. Though the girl was able to find a recipe for an antidote in her father's records, she will require a sample of the selfsame poison in order to prepare the medicine. Moved by her resolve and decisiveness, you resolve to accompany the girl to the woods west of the forest and help her procure the venom she needs.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

She provides you with a phial to be used in collecting the sample of venom, as well as a word of warning: the medicine must be mixed while the venom is still fresh, meaning that if you tarry too long, you will have to procure a sample anew. Keeping this in mind, you scour the area in search of one of the ghastly creatures known as violet triffids.</target>
