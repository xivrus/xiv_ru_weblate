The Galdjent guard also confesses a lack of confidence that he will be able to offer the girl everything she needs, and asks if you would be willing to go with him and lend a helping hand. Moved by his generosity and sympathy for the orphaned girl's plight, he resolves to make the trip back to Fort Jobb.
