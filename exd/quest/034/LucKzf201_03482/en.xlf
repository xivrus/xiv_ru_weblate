Before setting their sights on the far reaches of Norvrandt, however, they decide on visiting a settlement close to home─Slitherbough. Knowing full well their presence will incite panic among the Night's Blessed, they ask you to accompany them. With a smile and a nod you agree to help, prompting them to leave for Slitherbough.</target>

The reason, it seems, is that Quinfort has had yet another vision of catastrophe, and he is all but convinced the great serpent is somewhere close by. He throws all caution to the wind and runs off into the woods in search of the supposedly mythical snake, with Ciuna hot on his trail. Phyna bids you follow them to guarantee their safety while she escorts Valan back to Fanow.</target>

Unfortunately, none may enter save for the late emperor...and a certain adventurer who just so happens to possess the seal of Ronka.

The battle raged for many days and many nights and finally, the ancient guardian stood triumphant. The dreaded snake was sealed in an immense jewel, its true name never to be uttered again. The years spent in slumber quelled its rage, and the seething ire it once exuded became a benign aura. Man came to worship the jewel, and thus the great destroyer became the great protector of the wood.</target>

To the west, he sent his priests who would watch over the slumbering serpent from the Covered Halls of Dwatl. Together they would protect the empire, and so did it thrive.</target>

Lamenting their loss, the great protector thrashed and writhed within the great jewel, stirring the power of the earth, causing the trees to grow ever thicker, ever greener. And the guards of the pyramid would become guardians of an ever-expanding forest.”</target>
