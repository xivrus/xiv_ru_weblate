As she tells it, her father Colphas─proprietor of the infirmary you visited─is dead, slain by a vile sin eater at Holminster Switch. She would share the sad news with Nielden, a close friend of her father's who made a promise to look after the girl in the event of tragedy, but fears that she would never survive the trip to his distant and dangerous post. With a smile, you tell the girl you would be more than happy to travel to Radisca's Round in her stead.

As he is on active duty, he asks that you make the request with his superior─one Captain Mynes─on his behalf.</target>
