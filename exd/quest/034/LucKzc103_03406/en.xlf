Nodding sagely at your words, they decide upon doing something to make their fellow pixies happy: making them a gift of flowers. To that end, you are tasked with picking the vibrant blossoms that bloom at Timh Gyeus.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>

However, before they can offer the gift to others, two distraught pixies arrive with word of trouble. It appears that a pixie named Hagan Nee is being chased by a monstrous fiend, and if you do not act quickly, they will most certainly meet an unspeakable end.</target>
