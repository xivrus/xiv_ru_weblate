        <target state="final">TEXT_LUCKZC102_03405_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Disheartened but not defeated, Ul Thon again asks for your advice on how to become popular. Taking your suggestion to heart, the pixie decides that they can impress by painting beautiful pictures such as those seen in tomes. While they see to making a brush, Ul Thon bids you harvest sap from the orange-leafed trees that grow at Timh Gyeus, which they will use to make paint.

※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.</target>
