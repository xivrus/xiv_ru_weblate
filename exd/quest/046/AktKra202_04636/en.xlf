        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKRA202_04636_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Erichthonios is adamant that the person behind the troubles in Pandæmonium is none other than Lahabrea. Themis acknowledges the possibility but remains doubtful that Lahabrea would put so many at risk for his own ambition. You all agree that the only way to find out for sure is to venture into Abyssos and meet the villain for yourselves. As you make toward the threshold to Pandæmonium's next circle, you steel yourself for what lies ahead.

He makes a convincing performance, but Themis sees through his act, declaring him an impostor. The proceedings are interrupted by the appearance of another man─the true Lahabrea, who calls Themis by the name “Elidibus.” With no reason left to hide the truth, the imitator introduces himself as Hephaistos before vanishing abruptly. As your companions depart for the relative safety of the facility's gates, Themis takes you aside to confirm that he is indeed the Convocation's emissary, and apologize for misleading you.</target>
