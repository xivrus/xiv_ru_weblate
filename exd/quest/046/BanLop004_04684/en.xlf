        <target state="final">TEXT_BANLOP004_04684_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Livingway tells you the story of Counselingway, a passionate Loporrit with the weighty responsibility of helping people with their troubles─a role which they spent their life eagerly anticipating, only to be told that the people of Etheirys would not be coming after all. This disappointment understandably plunged them into the depths of despair, and they have yet to emerge. Though the task that lies ahead may be more difficult than you could have anticipated, if anyone is to convince Counselingway that life remains worth living, it must be the Dreaming Ways.</target>

Managingway points out that this is not the only Loporrit the Dreaming Workshop has yet to inspire─and that these wayward Ways share the commonality of having once been tasked with interacting with the people of Etheirys directly. As their distress appears to originate with the loss of the friendly interaction they had anticipated, Dreamingway proposes that you get them together in pursuit of a common goal once more, that camaraderie might stimulate their dormant motivation.</target>
