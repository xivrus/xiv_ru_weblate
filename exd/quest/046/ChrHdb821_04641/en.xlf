Hoping to follow in the footsteps of Dorian, the editor in chief, as he chases his story into the heavens above, the irrepressible Nashu insists that you accompany her to Garlemald and its not-so-secret lunar portal.</target>

The Hildibrands free themselves, and, following a brief festival of masculinity, the alien vessel returns to reap the Mandervillian harvest─with extreme prejudice. Thankfully, the original Hildibrand is returned to you unharmed shortly thereafter by the craft's pilot─a short, blue, bipedal creature introduced to you as “Master PuPu.” Through the inspector's explanation and the impeccable timing of the Echo, you piece together the extraterrestrial's story, learning that PuPu has come from a distant star in search of his own missing comrade. In words that lean dangerously close to becoming a catchphrase, the impassioned Inspector Hildibrand vows to solve this latest case.</target>
