Laurenssen has come to Eorzea in pursuit of the truth─to wit, the origin of Starlight reindeer symbolism. He hopes to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that reindeer of eld once delighted young children with illusions, and he requires the aid of a cheerful adventurer such as yourself to set the stage for his experiment. You set off to gather a crowd of younglings, but Blitzen, the reindeer at the crux of this operation, shakes his head dolefully, seemingly less than enthusiastic...

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
