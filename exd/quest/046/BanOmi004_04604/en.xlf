Ever overflowing with ideas, Jammingway asserts that the dragons would be prime candidates. Though N-7000 expresses strong reservations given its civilization's role in the Dragonstar's untimely end, it is eventually convinced to make contact in the name of a better future for all involved.</target>

Though they do eventually succeed in this first step, it quickly becomes clear that your allied units will struggle to generate interest in the Last Dregs─or any feeling at all─due to the dragons' utter emotional exhaustion from having spent eons in mourning. Upon discussion, it is agreed that a dragon of more agreeable disposition might provide ideas on raising her kin from their dead-eyed torpor, so you make ready to return to Etheirys and consult with wise Vidofnir.</target>

She explains to your party that the sacred peaks of the Dragonstar once evoked such bittersweet nostalgia in Midgardsormr that he chose his brood's new home by the look of its mountains─the peak now known as Sohm Al first among them─and suggests you attempt to stir her lost kin's memories of the same. Fortunately, there is a Coerthan dessert that may do just that.</target>

Though your guest from Reah Tahra is reluctant at first, the sight of the dessert recalls memories of the Dragonstar's mountains that resonate to his very core, filling him with wistful fondness. Indeed, he soon wishes to bring other dragons to the Last Dregs for a similar experience, and reassures N-7000 that this will not mean the resuming of hostilities─for what is past is long, long past.</target>
