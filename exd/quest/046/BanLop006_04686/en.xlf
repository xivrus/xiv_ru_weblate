Despite the popularity of his proffered fare, he is concerned that carrots remain a dominant ingredient, and, with a solely Loporrit clientele, has few sources of inspiration as to alternatives. Fortunately, his delivery is from Dickon at the Last Stand, who has helpfully included a recipe of his own design, along with a request that Cookingway send along any ideas he subsequently dreams up. With this fruitful partnership established, Hoper's Hold is certain to be home to fresh flavors in no time.</target>
