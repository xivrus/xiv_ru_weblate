        <target state="final">TEXT_BANLOP003_04683_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Hopes bolstered by the success of the machining station, Dreamingway is eager to continue expanding the dreams on offer, and Managingway naturally has detailed thoughts on potential next steps. They suggest cooking as a dream unlikely to have occurred to many a Loporrit before─though due to this population-wide dearth of culinary expertise, the new station must needs be manned by Cookingway, or no one at all. With that in mind, you and Dreamingway set out for Old Sharlayan, where the Loporrit chef has been continuing his studies into Etheirys's cuisine of late.

Though he was unaware of his fellows' plight until this very moment, he feels an immediate call to assist them, and readily agrees to operate a cooking station in Hoper's Hold. As the residents of Bestways Burrow typically plate whole carrots─if, indeed, the carrot gets that far─and gnaw upon them directly, however, place settings and utensils will be required.</target>
