He hastily departs to search for it, but not before asking you to make sure no further danger has visited Pandæmonium. A somewhat miffed Nemjiji, however, suggests first scouring the archives of Elpis for information on the failed creations interred within, that you might gain the upper hand in any future encounters.</target>

Furthermore, the researcher informs you that a recent report from a keyward indicated that nothing is amiss in the facility.
