After being hauled into the sky and stuffed into a cramped space like so much airship baggage, I have at last convinced my amiable captor to release me from his custody. Master PuPu is not of this star─as was evinced by his unintelligible tongue and unfathomable technology─yet with the help of a preternaturally talented associate, I have deduced that the matter which brought him to our star is a cause worthy of investigation. Fear not, fellow sentient beings, for otherworldly origins notwithstanding, Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville is a friend to one and all!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
None the worse for wear after his extraterrestrial escapade, Hildibrand is eager to embark on a new case. Before his “channeling” can produce a viable lead, however, your recent Loporrit guide arrives to report a nearby sighting of...Hildibrand. Several moments of confusion and logical reasoning later, it is determined that one of the clones escaped PuPu's vaporization beam, and is now running loose somewhere on the moon. Hildibrand insists upon eliminating this impostor inspector before any damage can be done to the Manderville name.</target>

No sooner have you spotted the clone, however, when an all but in the altogether Godbert appears out of nowhere, and proceeds to demonstrate a cataclysmic level of Manderville affection for his beloved son. After the dust settles and the music stops, PuPu vaporizes the flawed duplicate, marking the end of one of the inspector's active cases. Godbert, meanwhile, is relieved to find the genuine Hildibrand in relatively good health. He offers his gratitude for your part in seeing his boy's soul safely reunited with his body, and expresses a desire to consult with you back in Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han. Something regarding a certain rare ore he located on the moon... Agreeing with the idea of heading starward, Hildibrand is eager to continue the search for PuPu's comrade closer to home.</target>

Delion holds back, however, and divulges to you his intention to investigate the little blue man and his diabolical devices. Even as you tacitly agree to assist the editor in chief, you are approached by Godbert with yet another request for aid. It seems the master goldsmith has turned his hand to armaments─a change brought on by the terrible events of the Final Days─and he now seeks to craft superior weapons as described in an ancient manual of Manderville family legacy. Should you have time to help gather the necessary materials, you are to alert Godbert's manservant...who will be waiting patiently nearby. For as long as it takes.</target>
