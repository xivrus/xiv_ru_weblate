				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANLOP001_04681_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You politely inquire with Dreamingway as to his purpose on Etheirys─which, as it transpires, is to beg your aid. Many of his comrades fell into a most un-Loporrit-like listlessness upon the abrupt cessation of the exodus, and it would seem they have yet to recover. Unable to abandon them to their melancholy, you agree to travel to the moon to help determine how best to revive their spirits.

Readily acquiescing to your proposal, she is quick to provide not only a space for Loporrit enrichment activities, but also two assistants with dreams of their own to share─Managingway and Coiningway. With no time to waste when so many exciting possibilities lie in store, your little group sets off to explore Hoper's Hold.</target>

Managingway, fortunately, is quick to remind him that it is necessary to decide what one intends to build before building it─and thus are a musical stage and sales booth added neatly to the agenda. Now equipped with at least a general understanding of the task ahead, you set about crafting durable components to be used in construction.</target>
