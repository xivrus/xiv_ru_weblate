        <target state="final">TEXT_BANOMI001_04601_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You speak to Jammingway, who has good news, bad news, and news of an as-yet-undetermined nature. The good news is that Stigma-4 has managed to fully reconstruct members of the Karellian civilization based on data obtained from the Dead Ends; the bad news is that it chose two Karellians of opposing factions, who are now poised to kill each other before they have even had their coffee. After some cajoling, Jammingway manages to corral them to a table─but there is no time to solve their civilization-ending disagreement just yet. First, you must investigate a new star that mysteriously appeared in the expanse of Ultima Thule in recent days, and see if it poses a threat to the continued operation of the Last Dregs.

Tensions have erupted at the Last Dregs over the serving of food unsuitable to Karellian tastes, and manager intervention is required. Jammingway is uncertain of what cuisine might be more palatable, but as they nevertheless ponder a future in which café patrons enjoy delicious dishes made with fresh, local ingredients, the area around you is reborn as land ripe for the tilling. Given that the newborn star is entirely composed of dynamis, your allies conclude that in this “Elysion,” pure sentiment can make the impossible, possible.</target>
