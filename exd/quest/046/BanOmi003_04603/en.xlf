        <target state="final">TEXT_BANOMI003_04603_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;To say that all is not going as well as your colleagues anticipated would be an understatement, given that you arrive to find that Patron-005 and Patron-006─of the nihilistic Nibirun civilization─have triggered an existential crisis in one of the Omicron barkeeps. N-7000 steps in to prevent a complete system shutdown and is fortunately able to redirect Nibirun attentions to the other settlements of Ultima Thule for a time, but it is clear that making satisfied customers out of these individuals will be a monumental undertaking. Seeking a better source of emotional influence and potential custom, the three of you agree to try the Ea, instead.</target>

It has no objections─evidently, incessant questioning is something of a pastime among the Ea─and goes so far as to invite a friend to join in. Though the pair end up asking more questions than you do, your rousing discussion nevertheless manages to stimulate their desire to learn more of the gustatory sensations they may have once experienced. To this end, your fellow managers propose experimenting with various dishes to see if any resonate, and send you off in search of unfamiliar flavors.</target>
