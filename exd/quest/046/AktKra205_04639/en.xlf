Lahabrea senses that his other half is cloistered away within the depths of Tartaros, where Athena carried out her most clandestine research. Themis makes ready to send you and the chief keyward to confront Hephaistos, that you might rid the world of his wickedness once and for all.

In the end, however, even the purloined power of Pandæmonium's prisoners is no match for your own, and the would-be god falls to you and your phantom band. At your heels, Lahabrea stands ready to at last set right the mistake of his past.</target>

A few well-placed words stir Erichthonios from his stupor, and gathering what strength he can, the keyward breaks free from the magic binding him. He inters Hephaistos in an aetherial casket, around which Lahabrea works his own magicks until all that remains is a fiery red crystal.</target>
