Happily, the repairs on the snowcraft are nearing completion, and it is decided that you will head back to its location in Cerulea Ingens. Alisaie is only too eager to depart, and much to her surprise, Zero offers to accompany you without the need for a bargain, seemingly having been inspired by Alisaie's earnest desire to help others. Alphinaud joins you as well, and so together you set forth, with Y'shtola and Estinien leading the way.</target>

With his dying breath, Cagnazzo bids you seek out Golbez to learn what has truly become of Azdaja. He then dissipates into aether, leaving a crestfallen Varshahn holding the eye of his beloved sister.</target>
