Godbert appears in short order, and after providing you with a brief history of Manderville weaponry, introduces you to the third member of your crew: the legendary blacksmith, Gerolt. Various obstacles yet stand in the way of Godbert and the recreation of his ancestor's armaments, and your particular task will be to acquire a sufficient quantity of manderium meteorite. According to Gerolt, the sky rocks in question might be available from one of Rowena's lackeys, Jubrunnah, who has set up shop near the city aetheryte.

The inert results are disappointing, to say the least. Godbert chooses that moment to make his appearance, treating a dumbfounded Gerolt to an outrageously masculine display of alchemy which transforms the liquid into glowing Exalamanderville. With all the necessary components now in place, Gerolt takes up his hammer, and succeeds in forging what is apparently only the first iteration of your chosen Manderville weaponry. Further refinements, however, will have to wait until Godbert has deciphered the next passage of his ancestor's manual. For the moment, it seems you are free to spend your time as you see fit.
