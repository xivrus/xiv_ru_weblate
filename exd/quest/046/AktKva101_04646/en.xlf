The letter details a request from one of the sultana's personal attendants, asking you to travel to Thanalan. After confirming your assent, Shallow Moor contacts Momodi to arrange a meeting, and you find yourself scheduled to speak with one “Kokoshu” outside the Quicksand in Ul'dah.</target>

The lady-in-waiting tells you the tale of an unusual gate discovered in the damaged sections of the Sil'dihn aqueducts, and of Nanamo's desire to see it firsthand. Upon your agreement to help the sultana in this endeavor, Kokoshu cedes the meeting to Nanamo herself. Her Royal Majesty elaborates that the symbol on this portal matches the design of a key gifted to her by her parents, and she is adamant that they meant for her to explore whatever lies beyond. As for your part, Nanamo feels that you are her best choice of escort if she wishes to investigate unimpeded by overprotective guards. It seems she has arranged for you to enter the Sil'dihn ruins via the entrance in central Thanalan, whilst she arrives undetected through the palace's secret tunnels...</target>
