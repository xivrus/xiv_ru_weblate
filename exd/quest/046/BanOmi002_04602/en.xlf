Their memories of the grim occasion are apparently quite similar to yours, as you find one sobbing into their salad while the other sighs mournfully. It would appear that they long for a glorious yesteryear, though that is about as much as you can glean before they take off at a sprint, heedless of Jammingway's shouted offer of tea.</target>

In the hopes of evoking even slightly less depressing memories in these poor souls, Jammingway suggests that you prepare a dish using ingredients with the comforting fragrance of the sea. As you head off to procure just such a thing, they and N-7000 set about coaxing the Grebuloffs out of their breakdown and back to the Last Dregs.</target>

The dish does its work in reminding them of happier times, and though they fervently wish that they had taken better care of their most precious natural resource, the memory of the many joys it brought their people cheers them significantly. This emotional about-face seems to trigger something in the dynamis of Elysion, for you immediately receive a transmission from Stigma-4 indicating that changes have been wrought upon the star.</target>

Though N-7000 appears to be the Omicron version of “inspired” by your success in turning the creatures' soul-deep despair into this hopeful scene, it confesses that it yet harbors doubts about what meaning can be found in the life of a replicated being. Jammingway, however, confidently assures it that, though the Omicrons and your café patrons may have been created from the memories and emotions of the long dead, the ability of their feelings to affect dynamis proves that they matter just as much to the cosmos as anyone else─and should behave accordingly.</target>
