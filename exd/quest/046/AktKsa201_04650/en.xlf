Your guide, she says, will be Sicard's allegedly “dear” acquaintance, Lord Emmanellain de Fortemps, who awaits your arrival even now with his usual enthusiasm and panache.

The young lord proudly announces that your first client is Lady Laniaitte of the Rose Knights, whom he himself holds in particular esteem, to put it lightly.

Immune to his antics, Laniaitte encourages him to act with decorum towards your next client, who is revealed to be none other than the infamous sky pirate crew the Redbills. This news gives Laniaitte pause, as marauding sky pirates are the very problem she had been speaking of earlier, but Emmanellain assures her that the Redbills could not possibly be complicit in such gauche affairs as reckless pillaging. With a sparkle in his eye, the young Lord de Fortemps skips off towards the Redbill standard on Coldwind, and you follow in his wake, wondering what grand adventure must await you among the clouds.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKSA201_04650_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;The Redbills are happy and well─none more so than their leader Leofard, who chuckles over his successful plan to lure you out to the Parrock. True to your sneaking suspicion, he has an adventure in store that requires your quick thinking and a sack of one-of-a-kind samples (which you off-load from your shoulder). The Redbills are having their own sky pirate problems, it seems, having lost precious cargo to a gang of scrags calling themselves the “Monstrous Cockatoos.” The stolen parts are instrumental to reconstructing a most important airship, so your sky pirate friends have concocted a plan─a plan that will be further explained upon your attendance in Idyllshire, where the Cockatoos have taken refuge. Emmanellain flutters back to the Rosehouse to apprise Lady Laniaitte of the situation, and you make your way to Dravania, shoulders conspicuously lighter, but heart pounding with anticipation.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="5" approved="yes"><source>5</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKSA201_04650_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;The plan is simple as it is clever─you and Leofard will disguise yourselves as a shady merchant and &lt;var 08 E905 ((her)) ((his)) /var&gt; bodyguard, respectively, and canvas the town in search of hidden Cockatoos. Spread enough rumors of the coin to be made in the sale of stolen airship parts, and said airship parts will indubitably appear, or so the theory goes. Dressed in Stacia's best attempt at what a black market merchant looks like, and trying not to stare too enviously at the beautiful samples Leofard is sporting, the two of you set off to canvas the town.

But their cockiness rallies as a surprising ally steps forward─Leofard's longtime rival Radlia, with a string of her Talons in tow. Proud and confident as ever, Radlia makes Leofard an offer she knows he can't refuse─his allegiance in exchange for those stolen airship parts─and for a moment, the comfortable smirk fades from Leofard's lips. Brusquely assuring Radlia that rebuilding his airship is more important than anything, he turns to the leading Cockatoo and accuses him of irreparably damaging the necessary pieces. Cockatoo denies this emphatically, unwittingly divulging the location of said cargo in the process, and the smirk is back in full force as Leofard contacts Utata via linkshell and relays the relevant coordinates. Having been outsmarted, and now facing &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;the&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt; &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 03 /var&gt; in mortal combat, the Cockatoos bravely turn tail and Radlia admits her defeat.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="8" approved="yes"><source>8</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKSA201_04650_SEQ_08&lt;tab&gt;Leofard, back in his own clothes, bids you return to the Parrock while he follows up with the Rose Knights regarding Cockatoo cleanup.

Cait Sith is just wondering what is to become of the Cockatoos' trove when Tataru Taru, your favorite boss and coinkeeper, greets you from the threshold with a cheerful wave. Beside her stands an elderly man in a paint-flecked apron. Apparently, Leofard tasked her with finding this portraitist Duremert, who is not only the creator of a number of paintings found amongst the appropriated goods, but father of the late Lady Raimille, Leofard's adoptive mother. Regarding his grandfather with an expression obscured by his goggles but betrayed in his voice, Leofard announces that the successor to his airship─the next &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Raimille&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;─will be ready to take to the skies in no time.

After a healthy dose of adventure, a touching family reunion, and a few promising purrs from the brand-new &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Raimille&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, you, Tataru, and Duremert are preparing your return to Ishgard, when a package of surprising heft falls from the sky.
