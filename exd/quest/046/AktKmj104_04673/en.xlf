Alisaie asks Zero to assist in the effort, but she refuses, stating that she will not risk her life without suitable compensation. Jullus, however, succeeds in persuading Zero to help guard Tertium by reminding her of the buuz he gave her.

She arrived in time to save a pair of soldiers from voidsent, but soon found herself overwhelmed. Thankfully, you arrived in time to save her and put the enemy to rout.</target>
