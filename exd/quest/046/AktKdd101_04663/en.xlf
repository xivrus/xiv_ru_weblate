Using G'raha Tia's royal blood as a key, she hopes to gain access to Eureka Orthos, a secret Allagan facility that held the empire's most clandestine research. After the gates are unlocked, she would have you delve into its long-forgotten halls, braving the dangers lying in wait and bringing Allag's secrets to the surface.
