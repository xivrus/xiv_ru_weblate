Before continuing the tale, the archmagus sets off again, as much to keep her own blood flowing as to keep you from dozing off.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKDD103_04665_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;At the final stop of your journey, Noah relates to you the story of Artorius, who was returned to life in Amon's quest to revive Xande. Once king of a prosperous nation, Artorius saw his home and people subjugated by the Allagans before being made to serve under their banner. Upon his resurrection he returned to the empire's ranks but found that his sympathies lay with the rebels. When these cracks in his loyalty were exposed, Artorius was slain by an assassin wielding Excalibur, after which he was transformed into a twisted abomination that crushed the rebellion at the empire's behest. With Noah's store of secrets exhausted, her essence departs the vessel of Koh Rabntah for the final time─or so the archmagus thinks. The young researcher protests most shrilly, pleading for Noah to remain and share more of her encyclopedic knowledge. Noah begrudgingly obliges, but there is a sense that the archmagus is happy to remain. With you and Koh Rabntah to carry on the story of Allag's deeds, the empire's legacy may endure well into the ages yet to come.</target>
