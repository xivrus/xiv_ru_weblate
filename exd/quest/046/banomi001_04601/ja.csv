"","TEXT_BANOMI001_04601_SEQ_01<tab>You speak to Jammingway, who has good news, bad news, and news of an as-yet-undetermined nature. The good news is that Stigma-4 has managed to fully reconstruct members of the Karellian civilization based on data obtained from the Dead Ends; the bad news is that it chose two Karellians of opposing factions, who are now poised to kill each other before they have even had their coffee. After some cajoling, Jammingway manages to corral them to a table─but there is no time to solve their civilization-ending disagreement just yet. First, you must investigate a new star that mysteriously appeared in the expanse of Ultima Thule in recent days, and see if it poses a threat to the continued operation of the Last Dregs.
