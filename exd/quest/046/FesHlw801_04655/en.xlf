        <target state="final">TEXT_FESHLW801_04655_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;All Saints' Wake is upon us once more, and as is apparently now custom, the Adventurers' Guild has hired an investigator to keep a close eye on the Continental Circus. In the hopes of supplanting their schemes before they can take root, he plans to sponsor a costume cortege. To promote the event, he bids you drink a potion provided by the Alchemists' Guild to transform yourself into a frightful creature fit for the occasion and speak with the townspeople.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
