According to the tales passed down through the bugyo's line, Seiryu was a deity who possessed mastery over water, which he used to aid mortals by quelling storms and calming seas. The existence of such a benevolent being serves to assure Sibly, who gives the bugyo her heartfelt thanks. With her task thus accomplished to her satisfaction, the bugyo suggests returning to Limsa Lominsa.</target>
