However, he is &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;not&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; so pleased to inform you that their mascots─chocobo chicks dressed in ryu costumes─are struggling to win over the locals. Wishing to discover the cause of the cold reception, the metsuke bids you assist his delegation's leader, the ryu bugyo, who can be found at the edge of the Aftcastle with her feathered friend.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Yet while the bugyo's passion cannot be faulted, she fails miserably in her attempt to capture the girl's interest. As she is speaking to you of her woes afterwards, she realizes that Ryunosuke has wandered off after the girl, and asks for your help to find them. Thus do you make your way to the Drowning Wench, hoping to discover clues regarding their whereabouts.</target>

The girl apologizes for causing you trouble, but ere she can take her leave, the bugyo broaches the subject of her father and his impending voyage. Sibly explains that, on account of Llymlaen not being chosen this Heavensturn, she thought that she might instead pray to a Far Eastern deity to keep her father safe. Thus did she seek out the bugyo, only to find her too focused on her own mission to lend an ear. Reflecting upon her blunder, the bugyo is inspired by Ryunosuke and the nearby waterfalls to tell a new tale about the ryu, assuring Sibly that it will grant her comfort.</target>
