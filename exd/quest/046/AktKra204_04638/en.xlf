However, he insists that Erichthonios stay behind, fearing him to be a liability during such a dangerous endeavor. The warder lashes out at his father, but is abruptly overcome by dark forces and spirited away to depths unknown. Time will be of the essence in determining your next course of action.</target>

Agdistis, the final keyward, stands in your way, and although she is hidden away in the facility's liminal spaces, your aether allows you to be conveyed directly to her lair. Make ready to test your mettle against Pandæmonium's most gifted keyward.

As you ponder this mystery, the essence of Agdistis materializes before you, and you recognize her voice as the one vaguely heard throughout your investigation. With the last of her waning strength, she reveals a truth that Lahabrea long concealed for his son's peace of mind─namely, that Athena intended to use Erichthonios as a test subject for her experiments. Pieces of the puzzle are beginning to fall into place, with the promise of more to be found as you make ready to confront Hephaistos at last.</target>
