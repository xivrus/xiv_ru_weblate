This observation is reaffirmed by Jammingway, who estimates your café may even be as well-patronized as Sharlayan's famous Last Stand. Wishing to be certain, the management team heads on-site to confirm.

With no objectives left to achieve in order for the café to be considered a success, N-7000 asserts that it has no choice but to consider its mission accomplished and enter permanent hibernation for maximum efficiency. Jammingway is, of course, hopping mad about their business partner's imminent demise, but the Omicron is either unwilling or unable to be talked out of its protocols at present, and heads for Base Omicron despite their protests. Uncertain of what to do, yet knowing you must do something, you elect to pursue it.</target>

Though it has yet to find a way around the logic of its inevitable shutdown, it is clear that it would if it could. You remind it that its existence, in some ways, is already an impossibility, which at last spurs it to consider the idea that its potential is not bound by petty scientific laws. Alas, the resulting epiphany is so engaging that it immediately overclocks its processors and becomes lost in multi-sim mode, which appears liable to cause a meltdown any moment now.</target>

N-7000 clearly desires. With data about an ingredient that may be of use in refrigerant in mind, you make for what may generously be termed the “wilds” of Ultima Thule.</target>
