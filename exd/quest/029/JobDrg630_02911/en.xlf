Orn Khai is initially distracted upon seeing the parchment, as dragons do not have a written language; they pass down their history through song, which is how he knows the name of his father's consort: Faunehm. Heustienne asks you to accompany Orn Khai to the Fringes to learn more about the Slumbering Wyrm.</target>

Orn Khai is, however, undeterred and convinces Ser Alberic to come up with a way to allow him to make the crossing to Kugane.
