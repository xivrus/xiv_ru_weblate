You set off to relay this information to Heustienne and Orn Khai.</target>

Orn Khai is initially distracted upon seeing the parchment, as dragons do not have a written language; they pass down their history through song, which is how he knows the name of his father's consort: Faunehm. Heustienne asks you to accompany Orn Khai to the Fringes to learn more about the Slumbering Wyrm.</target>

He goes on to give you a lecture on the subject─the only noteworthy part of which being that the Slumbering Wyrm was actually a high priest, who passed away over three hundred years prior. Orn Khai soon grows tired of Erik's musings and suggests you head to Coerthas to speak with Ser Alberic. </target>

This one's roots lie far to the east, Ser Alberic remarking that Orn Khai may struggle to make the journey with you due to his modestly sized wings. Orn Khai is, however, undeterred and convinces Ser Alberic to come up with a way to allow him to make the crossing to Kugane.
