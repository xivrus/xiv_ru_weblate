Telling you the only way for you to save her is to track down and dispatch of this half-formed creature, Surito Carito leaves you to return to Alka Zolka.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH680_02926_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;As you are informing Alka Zolka of the current state of affairs, Landenel approaches you with interesting news. He tells you of how a large number of his men have encountered a ghost in the forest─one in the form of a floating purple orb. This description happens to match the partially summoned Lilac at the ruins, and you and Alka decide to investigate. According to Landenel, the Wailers have spotted the phantom faerie in Snakemolt and the Upper Paths.

He tells you of how one of his men was just attacked by the phantom faerie, which then escaped into the Lost City of Amdapor. While eager to give chase, due to the darkness that lingers there, the commanding Wood Wailer must first receive permission from the Order of the Twin Adder before any of you can enter. Asking that you make preparations while you wait, he goes to speak with his higher-ups.
