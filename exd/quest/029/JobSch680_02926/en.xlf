        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH680_02926_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In attempting to summon Lilac, Setoto has expended a majority of her aether─a condition one can normally recover from with a bit of rest. Despite having been asleep for quite some time now, however, the tonberry girl shows no signs of improvement, and Alka grows worried that something else is wrong. He asks that you visit Surito Carito at the Wanderer's Palace that the two of you might combine your scholarly knowledge to determine what exactly is amiss.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH680_02926_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Surito Carito speculates that the reason Setoto has not recovered is because she managed only a partial summoning. He believes this has resulted in a phantom faerie, which has forestalled her recovery by preventing her aether from being returned to her. Telling you the only way for you to save her is to track down and dispatch of this half-formed creature, Surito Carito leaves you to return to Alka Zolka.</target>

He tells you of how a large number of his men have encountered a ghost in the forest─one in the form of a floating purple orb. This description happens to match the partially summoned Lilac at the ruins, and you and Alka decide to investigate. According to Landenel, the Wailers have spotted the phantom faerie in Snakemolt and the Upper Paths. The ex-marauder will be searching Snakemolt, while you have a look around the Upper Paths.</target>

As the two of you prepare to open up discussions on how you might proceed, Landenel appears, once again. He tells you of how one of his men was just attacked by the phantom faerie, which then escaped into the Lost City of Amdapor. While eager to give chase, due to the darkness that lingers there, the commanding Wood Wailer must first receive permission from the Order of the Twin Adder before any of you can enter. Asking that you make preparations while you wait, he goes to speak with his higher-ups.
