        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDR104_02931_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With Biggs and Wedge not expected to report back for some time, Cid proposes that you move ahead with the tests. Your next opponent, Delta III, is apparently a being known as Halicarnassus, which Nero reveals to be the antagonist from a tale dating back to the Fourth Astral Era. Hearing this, Cid expresses surprise at the thought that Omega is deriving its subjects from works of fiction, at which moment Midgardsormr manifests to provide some timely insight. Omega, the Father of Dragons explains, has no soul and is therefore incapable of imagination; be it from fact or fiction, it must draw upon historic material in order to create. While the revelation excites Nero, it gives Cid a moment's pause, but he sets his questions aside in favor of focusing on the task at hand: defeating Halicarnassus. As has now become traditional, Alpha is waiting patiently for your signal to proceed.

※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.</target>
