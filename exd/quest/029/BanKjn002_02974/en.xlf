				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_BANKJN002_02974_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Kabuto approaches you in hushed tones about his first expedition. When he fails to state anything beyond the obvious─that they will soon be departing─Tsukumo takes it upon himself to better inform you of their plan. As he tells it, they recently received word of a promising addition to the vault somewhere near Namai in Yanxia. With no other leads, Tsukumo skips away with Kabuto in tow.

Though Tsukumo believes your time would be better spent learning more about the Namazu, Kabuto insists on commencing a search for this elusive figure so as not to waste any more of your time. Tsukumo is equal parts surprised and impressed by this sudden assertiveness and eventually concedes. Your next course of action is decided, and so you make for the Glittering Basin.</target>

Despite Hirumaki making off with the vase, Gyokei is oddly relieved. As he explains it, the vase was cursed to bring misfortune to its owner, and he was hard-pressed to find a way to break the curse or dispose of it. Gyokei readily agrees to become a trading partner with the Blue Kojin, and offers a chime from his storehouse as a token of good faith. Kabuto and Tsukumo then return to Tamamizu for a well-earned rest.</target>
