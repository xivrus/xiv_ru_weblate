Then wait a while longer. Just as he was beginning to lose hope, the other members of the Divine Circle arrive. They each have taken steps to prepare for the upcoming battle, and their remaining brothers are all at the ready outside of Tamamizu. It is time for battle, and so Kabuto bids you follow him to the Dive.</target>

A duel ensues, and the ringing of steel against steel is deafening. Alas, Kabuto appears to be no match for Hirumaki. The red-shelled swordsman prepares to deliver the finishing blow when Tsukumo struggles to speak. He offers a few words of encouragement before growing still, and Kabuto realizes at once what has happened. He then finds the strength to strike one last time. Hirumaki collapses to the ground, but Kabuto follows shortly after. With the general defeated, the other Blue Kojin carry the unmoving Tsukumo and Kabuto back to Tamamizu.</target>

Kabuto's hopes of saving Tsukumo are dashed, however, when she tells him there is nothing she can do. Feeling defeated, Kabuto casts a sullen look at the altar and notices a peculiar gem on the ground. Shihoumi is quick to identify it as materia, and wastes no time affixing it to Kabuto's helmet. Taking the materia as a parting gift, he vows to honor Tsukumo's memory by redoubling his efforts to serve the Divine Circle.</target>
