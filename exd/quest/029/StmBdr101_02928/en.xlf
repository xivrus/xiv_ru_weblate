At length, he grudgingly agrees to tolerate his old rival's presence, and takes the opportunity to beseech your aid in the ongoing investigation into Omega. Moments later, an engineer rushes in with grave tidings: aetheric readings have risen alarmingly at the Yawn, where Omega is thought to be hiding. Fearing the worst, Cid resolves at once to visit the scene and asks that you accompany him.</target>

Then, without warning, a chocobo-like creature bursts out of the pool followed by an enormous, translucent serpent. Once the initial panic has passed, Midgardsormr explains that Omega is capable of bringing forth life, and that the serpent was one of its creations. All eyes duly turn to what appears to be an approximation of a chocobo, which has settled at the party's side.</target>

Shortly thereafter, Omega reaches out to you via one of its monitors and declares that you are to participate in an experiment. It seeks to determine the mightiest being by pitting subjects against one another in combat, to which end it has selected and recreated eighty-nine entities. You are provisionally assigned to the Alpha group, so named for your new chocobo friend, and your first task will be to fight your way to a place called the Deltascape. In so doing, you will prove your fitness to be fully fledged test subjects.
