He laments that he has little to show for all his years, and has been unable to uncover the source of Faunehm's rage. However, as luck would have it, it is Orn Khai's despair that allows him to see the truth─Faunehm's current state is a result of having to bear centuries of solitude. Just as he happens upon this theory, the warrior you previously met informs you that some Qestiri merchants have hired a dragon hunter. You hurry with Orn Khai to get to Faunehm before the hunter can.</target>
