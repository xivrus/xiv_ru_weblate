Despite her most enthusiastic response, however, the spirited princess has yet to arrive. You and Jacke take to the streets of Kugane in hopes of finding the girl before she runs afoul of any unsavory types.</target>

He gleefully explains that he has prepared a “game” of sorts for you and your friends: you are to rescue your friends from the hideout of the Garnet League and claim the scroll as your prize, or fail and see your friends' lives forfeit. Having no choice but to submit to the eccentric shinobi's cruel and capricious demands, you and your friends set out for the Isle of Bekko.</target>

With his friend and fellow shinobi's life in the balance, Oboro tosses the scroll to a gloating Karasu, who unceremoniously shoves Tsubame in your general direction. Karasu's enigmatic master then arrives on the scene, and with a few dismissive words, seemingly roasts Karasu to a husk with a breath of fire before your very eyes. Claiming to be Hanzo of the Kagekakushi clan─the only true practitioners of the art of ninjutsu─he ominously states his desire to rid the world of the descendants of “Sasuke the Shamed,” as he dismissively refers to the legendary progenitor of the Doman shinobi. As Oboro stands stunned, Tsubame comforts him with a secret entrusted to her by one her elders─namely, that the scroll in Hanzo's hands is but one half of the forbidden summoning mudra he covets. As Underfoot and V'kebbe return home to Limsa, you set out for Yanxia with Oboro, Tsubame, and Jacke, to inform the elders of all you have seen and glean what wisdom you might before planning your next action.</target>

The young shinobi promises you that they will return as soon as they are able, and you and Jacke resolve to keep your skills sharp in anticipation of the inevitable confrontation to come.
