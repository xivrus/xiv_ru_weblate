Despite this, they do not seem particularly eager to welcome him back, a development which has the young shinobi feeling decidedly unappreciated. As Oboro laments his plight, he remembers that there is someone who requires his aid─Captain Jacke of the Rogues' Guild, who would investigate some shady Domans that have been stirring up trouble of late.
