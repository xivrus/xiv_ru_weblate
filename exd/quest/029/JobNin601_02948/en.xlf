        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBNIN601_02948_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You find your old friend Oboro at something of a loss. News of his deeds on behalf of Princess Yuki have reached his village, revealing to the elders that he is hale, hearty, and entirely capable of making the journey home. Despite this, they do not seem particularly eager to welcome him back, a development which has the young shinobi feeling decidedly unappreciated. As Oboro laments his plight, he remembers that there is someone who requires his aid─Captain Jacke of the Rogues' Guild, who would investigate some shady Domans that have been stirring up trouble of late. Resolving to assist your friend and mentor in whatever way you can, you set out for Limsa.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBNIN601_02948_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Jacke relates to you a curious tale. The Krakens captured a crew of self-styled Doman sailors in the eastern seas, who offered all the treasures in their cargo hold in exchange for amnesty and safe passage to Eorzea. No sooner had the ship dropped anchor, however, than the Easterners vanished into the dark of night, taking with them only an inconspicuous scroll. Petty theft though it may be, the code is the code, and Jacke would see the scroll returned and the men brought to justice. At the guildmaster's behest, you make for the Drowning Wench to see if I'tolwann knows aught of the men's whereabouts.</target>

No sooner have you begun to ponder your next course of action when you are greeted by the sudden presence of the black marketeer from the House of Sticks, who─much to everyone's surprise─immediately reveals himself to be none other than Karasu Redbeak, Oboro's erstwhile friend and nemesis. As is his wont, Karasu speaks in riddles, cryptically alluding to a greater plot involving the scroll while offering precious little in the way of actual details─save that your true quarry sails for Kugane as you speak. Karasu disappears in a puff of smoke, and Oboro─clearly flustered─suggests that the three of you retreat to the nearby ninja hideout to discuss your next course of action in secret.</target>
