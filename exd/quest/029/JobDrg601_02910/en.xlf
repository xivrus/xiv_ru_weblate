As the topic of conversation turns to Heustienne's plight, her father, Montorgains appears. He mentions that he was recently handed a rather peculiar letter, bearing his daughter's name, that was a cry for your aid. You agree to help Heustienne once more and set off to meet her near Mare's Oath.</target>

Rather surprisingly, said friend is revealed to be a young dragon named Orn Khai. Heustienne explains that you were called to aid him in his search for his father's consort, who left Eorzea and flew to the east quite some time ago. You agree to help Orn Khai and are advised by Heustienne to try asking Ser Alberic about Dravanian legends concerning areas to the east.</target>
