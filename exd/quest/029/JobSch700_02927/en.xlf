Almost immediately you spot the phantom faerie and give chase. Puzzled by its movements, Alka comments that the sphere of purple light seems as though it is attempting to guide you somewhere. It eventually fuses together with Kuribu─one of the guardian statues. After defeating the resulting amalgamation, you glance down to see a blood red gem gleaming upon the ground.</target>

Alka is relieved to see that she is finally awake. Setoto tells you briefly of a dream she saw of her father and it spurs Alka to once more question the half-manifested Lilac's intentions for entering the lost city and seemingly leading you to Kuribu. He then turns to you and inquires as to what you crouched down to retrieve right before leaving Amdapor. You hold out the gemstone and Alka, recognizing its possible value, requests that you to deliver it to Surito Carito for inspection.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH700_02927_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;According to Surito Carito, the gemstone is the crystal core of the statue you defeated and contains potent white magic. He surmises that Lilac, a part of Setoto's father's consciousness, was driven by a strong desire to see Setoto cured of the Green Death. As such, the phantom faerie led you through the lost city that you might discover this gem, which may contain a remedy to the condition afflicting inhabitants of the Wanderer's Palace.</target>
