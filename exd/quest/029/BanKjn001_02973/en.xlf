        <target state="final">TEXT_BANKJN001_02973_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You find a young maiden along the shore in the company of a Blue Kojin with two Red Kojin fallen at their feet. Mistaking you for a threat, the Blue Kojin prepares to fight, but soon lowers his blade as you explain why you have come. The maiden before you is, in fact, Shihoumi, and she tells of the Blue Kojin's daring rescue. Though gravely injured, he soon runs off to retrieve Shihoumi's stolen cargo from the Red Kojin. She begs you to save him from this fool's errand before it is too late.</target>
