Gallien, an Ala Mhigan refugee for whom you once made medicine long, long ago, reveals that he shared it with another refugee, ensuring that the man lived...and that he would not. His friend Houdart went on to fight for the Griffin and even served as his body double, but ultimately died at Baelsar's Wall with his mad master and so many others. They made their choices, and such are the consequences, but Myste cannot help but meddle. He conjures a simulacrum of Houdart to comfort the dying man, who bids his dead friend to go to Rhalgr's Reach and pray for their fallen brothers.</target>
