Hilda wonders at the firearm used, and her comment triggers an outburst from a nearby noblewoman. According to the noblewoman's frantic ramblings, a firearm-wielding bandit has recently begun terrorizing the western highlands. While Hilda heads out to confirm this rumor, she asks that you visit the Skysteel Manufactory and see what Stephanivien can make of the deformed bullet.</target>
