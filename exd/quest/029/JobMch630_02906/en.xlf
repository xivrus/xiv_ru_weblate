It would seem that Hrunting─the sacred blade used for the investiture ceremony─has been stolen from the Temple Knights' treasury. Hilda offers the services of the watch to recover the sword, and the beleaguered Ser Muscadain grudgingly accepts. Begin the investigation by speaking to the treasury guard captain at the Hoplon.</target>

According to the noblewoman's frantic ramblings, a firearm-wielding bandit has recently begun terrorizing the western highlands. While Hilda heads out to confirm this rumor, she asks that you visit the Skysteel Manufactory and see what Stephanivien can make of the deformed bullet.</target>
