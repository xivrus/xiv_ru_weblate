Hoping to resolve the matter quickly, and without incident, she enlisted the aid of the wandering minstrel who helped drive off these insectoid machines once before. Though there have been no sightings of the creatures for several days, the wandering minstrel has yet to return, causing Nonora to worry. She bids you venture to Nophica's Wells, where she last heard word from him, and see what you can find.

Destroying the final bug triggered peculiar magicks that not only transported him to your present surroundings, but also stripped him of his ability to teleport. With no way out, he thought to examine the remains of a bug that followed him through the void. He deduced there is a secret command that, once uttered, will dispel the magicks that hold him there.
