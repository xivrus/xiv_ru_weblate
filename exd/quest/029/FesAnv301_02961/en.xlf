        <target state="final">TEXT_FESANV301_02961_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;According to Nonora, a mechanical menace thought long since defeated has returned to disrupt the realm's celebration of remembrance. Hoping to resolve the matter quickly, and without incident, she enlisted the aid of the wandering minstrel who helped drive off these insectoid machines once before. Though there have been no sightings of the creatures for several days, the wandering minstrel has yet to return, causing Nonora to worry. She bids you venture to Nophica's Wells, where she last heard word from him, and see what you can find.

※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone.</target>

Though he is nowhere in sight, you are certain this is the handiwork of the wandering minstrel. While you know naught of the origins of the void hovering silently above the bugs' remains, a closer examination of it may offer a clue as to the minstrel's whereabouts.</target>

Destroying the final bug triggered peculiar magicks that not only transported him to your present surroundings, but also stripped him of his ability to teleport. With no way out, he thought to examine the remains of a bug that followed him through the void. He deduced there is a secret command that, once uttered, will dispel the magicks that hold him there. He attempted to probe its mechanical mind but what he found was a complex labyrinth seemingly bereft of rhyme or reason. Having exhausted himself after days of searching, he asks that you take up the quest in his stead.</target>
