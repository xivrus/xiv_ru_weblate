Not too long after, R'ashaht appears bearing some interesting news. The Miqo'te commander tells you that Vesper Bay has been awash with rumors of an odd-looking stowaway who scurried off a ferry as it pulled ashore. Whoever─or whatever─it was, has been described as being small of stature like a Lalafell but with exotic features.

Rest while you can because as soon as word of Setoto's possible whereabouts reaches you and Alka Zolka, the two of you must rush to find, and possibly rescue, the tonberry.
