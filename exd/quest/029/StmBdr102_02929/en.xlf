You will not be entirely alone in there, however; as you will need to make use of Alpha's “existential authorization,” he will go with you into the test world.

When Nero subsequently questions Omega's apparent obsession with determining the strongest being, Midgardsormr appears and explains that, having defeated Shinryu, it now seeks to create a mightier foe to fight. Fearing that the violence of such an encounter would be akin to another calamity, Cid is determined to stop Omega's plan. He duly grants Biggs and Wedge leave to investigate the stasis system in Carteneau, while he and Nero remain in the rift to aid you in the tests to come.</target>
