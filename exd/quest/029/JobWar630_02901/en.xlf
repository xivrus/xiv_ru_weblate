				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBWAR630_02901_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Broken Mountain has decided on how he might begin training Dorgono. As he prepares to help her gain mastery of her inner beast, however, he cannot help but worry for Curious Gorge, who claims his inner beast has fallen silent. Sadly there is no time to lament further, for the Maelstrom has requested the aid of Broken Mountain's troop of warriors to rout a band of outlaw Mamool Ja. He sees this as an opportunity for Dorgono, as he believes building a resolve to defend her allies will allow her to gain control of her inner beast. He readies his men, and makes for the ruins of Nym in outer La Noscea.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBWAR630_02901_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;With everyone assembled, Broken Mountain explains to you his plan. With Dorgono in tow, he means to take his band of warriors along the Long Climb and sweep through the Mamool Ja's main force. Meanwhile, you are to sneak through the heart of the ruins and pick off the sentries. With everyone assigned their orders, you split up, seeking to rendezvous on the path leading toward the Hermit's Hovel.</target>

Yet her calm and cool composure was not cause for celebration. Curious Gorge─taking an innocent stroll through the ruins of Nym─happened to see her fighting, and noticed that Dorgono was holding back. Though she only meant to spare her comrades the risk of her inner beast, this means she has yet to harness the power raging within her. Nevertheless, the Mamool Ja have been routed, and Maelstrom shipments may now pass through safely. All that remains is to return to the Moraby Drydocks and rest.</target>

Strange that he would stumble upon your mission in the ruins of Nym. Broken Mountain believes it is related to the source of Curious Gorge's personal dilemma, but assures you it is nothing to worry about. For now he bids you rest, and prepare for the next step in Dorgono's training.
