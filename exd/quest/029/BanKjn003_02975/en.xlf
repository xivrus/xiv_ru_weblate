Because the Kojin are unfamiliar with the Steppe, Tsukumo asks that you accompany them on this expedition. No sooner do you consent than they make for Reunion.

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANKJN003_02975_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;Uchikin is silent, but his look of relief upon being reunited with his bow speaks volumes. It soon becomes clear that bow has no supernatural powers nor is Uchikin a naturally gifted marksman. In truth, his talent is born from the incredible time and dedication he poured into honing his skills. Kabuto and Tsukumo have no interest in asking for something he considers so precious and are ready to depart when Uchikin's father hands them an envelope. Enclosed within is a document granting the Blue Kojin leave to barter and trade in Reunion. There are, however, still finer details of the agreement that must be discussed. Tsukumo and Kabuto follow Uchikin's father back to Reunion and ask you to meet with them back in Tamamizu.</target>
