He further theorizes that Theodoric had his kinsmen cursed and cast into the depths not only to punish them for their imagined crimes, but to have them serve as guardians over his treasures. Whilst Alphinaud and Arenvald search for a way into the ruins from above, you are to scour the loch bed for an underwater entrance.</target>
