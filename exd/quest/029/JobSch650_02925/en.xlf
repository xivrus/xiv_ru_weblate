        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;As Setoto appears to be fully recovered, Alka Zolka would like to begin the search for a memento of her father. The Royal Marine suggests beginning at Amdapor Keep. If, as you have come to suspect, Setoto's father was captured by the Amdapori while on a mission to discover a way to reverse the Nymian plague, he would have been transported to Amdapor Keep for questioning. It is then likely that some of his remaining possessions can be found there. Make your way to the ancient ruins and look for any items which Setoto might remember her father by.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH650_02925_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The three of you pick your way through Amdapor Keep, and you encounter various denizens of the ruins and ancient artifacts─including an Amdapori journal which touches upon taking a Nymian spy captive. From it you are able to conclude that Setoto's father's personal effects have been stored in a mana idol. As you begin dismantling these Amdapori golems, you are confronted by a manasnatcher, one of the hulking creatures that resides there. After a hard-fought battle, it falls lifeless to the ground, and a coffer tumbles from its innards. You, Alka, and Setoto move to open it.</target>

Gingerly taking the crystal in her hands, Setoto begs her father's faerie, Lilac, to appear. It unleashes a sphere of purple light and Setoto falls to the ground, unconscious. After an unsuccessful attempt to wake her, Alka Zolka bids you help him transport the tonberry out of the dangerous ruins and to Camp Tranquil.</target>

You conclude that, despite the lack of physical injuries, it will be a while before the young tonberry girl wakes. Alka is deeply troubled by the news, and his panicked shouts draw the attention of Landenel of the Wood Wailers, who offers to take Setoto into his care until such a time she has recovered. Requesting that you remain behind with her and Landenel, Alka Zolka leaves you for Bronze Lake to speak with Surito Carito.
