After commenting upon her beauty, he goes on to ask what motivated her to travel so far from her home in Bronze Lake. She tells you of how in the days before Nym's collapse her father was a scholar and Royal Marine. Suspecting he was captured by the Amdapori whilst on an undercover mission there, she sought to examine the ruins for anything that once belonged to him. Touched, Alka eagerly volunteers the both of you to aid her in her search. Return to Camp Tranquil with the tonberry girl and Alka to discuss how the three of you might proceed.</target>

Once he returns and Setoto is fully recovered, the three of you will be leaving to search Amdapor Keep for a memento of Setoto's father.
