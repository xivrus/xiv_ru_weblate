        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBWAR601_02900_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Since you last met Curious Gorge, the reputation of the Maelstrom and its warriors has spread far and wide. In fact, an anonymous band of marauders has challenged them to battle at the Wolves' Den. Though no one knows who these combatants are, they seem quite familiar with you and your exploits, as they have requested your attendance as well. Not one to disappoint, Curious Gorge wastes no time in traveling to the Moraby Drydocks to meet with his brother.</target>

The dust settles, but one of his marauders refuses to back down. Though Wyrnzoen is at a loss as to why she refuses to yield, the look in her eyes says it all─she has been blinded by the rage of her inner beast. Tossing Wyrnzoen, Broenbhar, and even Curious Gorge into the waters of the pier, you and Broken Mountain are left to subdue this savage beast alone.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBWAR601_02900_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Having returned to her senses, the young marauder introduces herself as Dorgono of the Qerel clan. The inner beast is not a foreign concept to her people, but they lack the understanding to control it. Because of this, those like her who are influenced by it are exiled. She has ventured to Eorzea to hone her skills in the hopes of mastering her inner beast. Broken Mountain readily accepts Dorgono as a new charge. Curious Gorge, on the other hand, deems himself unfit to train her and chooses to train on his own.</target>

For now he bids you rest, while he considers how best to go about her training.
