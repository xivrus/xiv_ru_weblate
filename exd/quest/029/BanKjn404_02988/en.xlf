        <target state="final">TEXT_BANKJN404_02988_ZUKIN_000_000&lt;tab&gt;There's something I would like you to investigate. I have had a report of an unusual object bobbing up and down on the waves. Apparently, it is giving off an unusual scent too.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANKJN404_02988_ZUKIN_000_001&lt;tab&gt;It is probably nothing, but we should look into it all the same. The smell might be caused by it dissolving into the water, so we should put it into a waterproof bag to help keep it intact.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_BANKJN404_02988_MAKURA_000_014&lt;tab&gt;Although we do not treat ambergris as “treasure” as such, it is nonetheless very rare and precious to the Kojin.</target>
