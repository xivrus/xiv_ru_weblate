"","TEXT_STMBDR105_02932_SEQ_01<tab>Ahead of your battle with Subject Delta IV, Nero furnishes you with some much-needed intelligence. Your opponent is a being known as Exdeath, who commands the power of the void. Like Halicarnassus before him, he is apparently the defeated antagonist of an age-old folktale. It is at this moment that Cid finally gives voice to his earlier quandary: why did Omega choose the vanquished instead of the vanquishers? Before you can contemplate the question, Cid receives a call from Biggs and Wedge, who report that they have been unable to repair the stasis system. And so it is decided that you must continue with Omega's experiment, at least for the time being. As always, Alpha is ready to proceed when you are.
