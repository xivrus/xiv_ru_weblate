The exasperated engineer subsequently notes the absence of Biggs and Wedge, who have apparently failed to return from their mission to Omega Control. Fearing that they may have encountered trouble, Cid resolves to look for them, and bids you join him at the airship landing in Gridania, where the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Excelsior&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; awaits.</target>

For a blessing, both are still alive, albeit in a bad way. The others soon join you, as does Omega via its communication system. It reveals that it was behind the attempt on the two engineers' lives, and threatens to kill innocent people unless you continue to participate in its experiment. Its objective: to study an anomaly known as heroes. Throughout history, it explains, otherwise unremarkable individuals have triumphed over vastly superior beings, just as you did in the Deltascape. Declaring itself “an enemy to all life upon this star,” Omega finally falls silent, leaving you to attend to your wounded friends.</target>
