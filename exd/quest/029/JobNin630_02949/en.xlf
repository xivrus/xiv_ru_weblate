It would appear that Oboro and Jacke have safely arrived on Hingan shores, and that their investigation into the stolen scroll has turned up some promising leads. Your shinobi friend and master bids you join him in Kugane to continue the search. After disembarking, seek out Oboro in the alley behind Pier #2.</target>

The theft of the scroll was apparently the work of the Garnet League, a band of masterless samurai who turned to banditry after having fled the battlefield in dishonor during the Doman uprising. Easily recognizable by their blood red garb and rough demeanor, they sojourn in Kugane of late. At Oboro's behest, spy upon them from the shadows of the Shiokaze Hostelry and the Rakuza District and see what knowledge you might glean of their plans, and of the scroll's current whereabouts.</target>

You also succeed in gathering more information on the Garnet League itself─namely, that it is led by one Zakuro Brightblood, a samurai feared for both her prowess with the blade and her nigh-legendary temper. Oboro and Jacke will doubtless be keen to hear all you have learned.</target>

Piecing together random bits of information, Captain Jacke devises a convoluted scheme to recover the scroll that will involve a high-wire act and imitation bird droppings, among other curious elements. With no better course of action coming immediately to mind, tasks are delegated amongst your party, and you prepare to move into action.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBNIN630_02949_SEQ_09&lt;tab&gt;Oboro and Jacke rejoice at the success of the mission. The shinobi's mood, however, darkens considerably upon seeing what the scroll actually is─a forbidden summoning mudra and ancient treasure of his village that went missing in the Garlean invasion of twenty-five years past. It would seem that the scroll slept untouched in an imperial vault until it was stolen by Zakuro and her minions at the behest of their mysterious client. As Oboro ponders who outside his village might have knowledge of the scroll, Karasu Redbeak appears in a puff of smoke, revealing that he was the one pulling the strings behind the operation on behalf of his new master, and threatening physical harm to Tsubame, V'kebbe, and Underfoot─who he has captured in the meantime─if you do not return the scroll to him. Issuing an enigmatic warning of some challenge to come, he disappears as quickly as he came, leaving you and your companions at an utter loss. Continue to hone your skill in the art of ninjutsu, that you may be ready for whatever deadly game the crow has in store for you.
