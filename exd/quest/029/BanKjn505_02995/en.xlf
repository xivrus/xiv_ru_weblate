        <target state="final">TEXT_BANKJN505_02995_ZUKIN_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Mother of pearl is used in many of our crafts, as you may have seen. The rarely seen diamond oyster is a prime source, and a whole host of them have suddenly appeared on the Isle of Bekko.</target>

They certainly live up to their name. I've tried prising them apart, dropping rocks on them, but no joy. </target>
