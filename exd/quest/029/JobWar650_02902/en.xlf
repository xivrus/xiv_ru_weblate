It goes without saying Broken Mountain means to repel the Mamool Ja once more. It should also come as no surprise that he expects you to accompany him on this mission. Not wishing to waste time, he makes haste to Raincatcher Gully, asking you to meet him there when you are geared for battle.</target>

Though he fears the risk of her losing control, he admits that this decision leaves them wanting for muscle. How fortunate, then, that Curious Gorge should again happen upon your gathering in the middle of Raincatcher Gully. With the aid of his axe, Broken Mountain will lead his men on a westerly route past the Severed String, while you head due south dispensing with any enemies who stand in your way.</target>

She turns to look at you with what seems to be murderous intent, but suddenly her eyes soften. Lowering her axe she realizes she has managed to suppress her inner beast. Curious Gorge, bearing witness to this mastery of self, sees her accomplishment as a source of ignominy. As he takes leave of the scene, too embarrassed to face the others, Broken Mountain and his men stagger over to congratulate Dorgono. They then return to the Moraby Drydocks to bid her a final farewell.</target>

However, there is still the matter of Curious Gorge and his now dormant inner beast. Broken Mountain is convinced his brother now faces a crisis the likes of which he has never known: he has fallen in love. Dorgono has left him a whirlwind of emotions, but time heals all wounds. Broken Mountain suggests giving his brother space to cope with these emotions on his own.
