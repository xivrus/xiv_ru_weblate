How fortunate, then, that Curious Gorge should again happen upon your gathering in the middle of Raincatcher Gully.

Curious Gorge, bearing witness to this mastery of self, sees her accomplishment as a source of ignominy.

Broken Mountain is convinced his brother now faces a crisis the likes of which he has never known: he has fallen in love. Dorgono has left him a whirlwind of emotions, but time heals all wounds.
