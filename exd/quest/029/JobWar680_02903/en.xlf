Unable to leave his post in Limsa Lominsa, he asks you to search for Curious Gorge and see that he does not come to harm.</target>

As she tells it, they are safe and sound at Reunion. Sadly, there would be no homecoming for Dorgono. The ones responsible for besieging their homes were the very same people they exiled from the Qerel clan. They have created an order of their own, the Chaghan, and believe the blind fury of their inner beasts is a gift from their goddess, the Dusk Mother. The Qerel believe Dorgono to be one of the Chaghan now, and refuse to allow her back. She is now determined to avenge her people and earn back their trust. Your help, and even Curious Gorge's, will be indispensable in this endeavor. As she leaves to go track their whereabouts, she suggests you return to Reunion to rest up and prepare for battle.</target>
