While lacking in lethality, the explosion would be sufficient to disrupt the ceremony and cast doubt upon Ser Aymeric's authority as well as the Hounds' competence. The chief machinist also mentions the circulation of nasty rumors, whose purpose appears to be to discredit the watch and thereby cripple the initiative to arm Ishgard's commoners.

Seeking to make the most of this opportunity, Muscadain proposes a plan to catch the culprits red-handed. Return to the Brume, and discuss your part in this operation with Hilda.</target>

You discover a noblewoman holding the detonator, but she and her allies prove reluctant to yield to the Hounds' authority. Battle is joined, and with Ser Muscadain's support, you eventually triumph over Baroness Melisie.</target>
