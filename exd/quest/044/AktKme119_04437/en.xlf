The scholars milling outside seem oblivious as to who sounded the alarum or why, but for you and your companions, the circumstances of this emergency are crystal clear. Wary of what other obstacles Hermes may have placed in your path, you assign roles, square your shoulders, and prepare to march into the magically expanded environs of Ktisis Hyperboreia.

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKME119_04437_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Silent until now, Hermes's question about happiness amongst the stars prompts Meteion to step forward and describe the anguished desperation of the races she encountered. She declares her intention to relieve all life of the burden of existence, and Hermes, after binding your company in chains of aether, accepts this ultimatum as a challenge to the worthiness of mankind. In order to ensure the “fairness” of this determination, the chief summons Kairos to alter the memories of everyone present, such that all that occurred since your arrival in Elpis would be wiped clean. Before the process begins, however, he bids Meteion escape to the edge of the universe, knowing that he will soon believe her and her sisters to have perished in an accident. It is then that Venat breaks her shackles and chases the entelechy into the sky. Likewise freed of your bonds, you and Hythlodaeus distract Hermes, while Emet-Selch tears a hole in the spatial confluence to afford you an escape route. Venat returns from her failed pursuit just in time to have Argos bear you both through the portal and evade the Kairos-induced amnesia. Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch are not so fortunate, and now it falls to you and Venat to remember─and safeguard─your respective realities.</target>
