        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKRA104_04478_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Although the hippokampos is back in fetters, Themis remains worried about the other warders. Erichthonios suggests that they might have found safe haven with the aid of Hesperos, keyward of Asphodelos, and fled to the innermost circle. This seems the best destination for you now─but Erichthonios reveals the path to be blocked by the phoinix, a bird of fulgent flame created in a failed attempt to give life to the sort of Phoenix with which you are more intimately familiar. When you set forth steeled for battle, however, the corridor around you warps into a scorched wasteland.

Declaring that he shall win the adulation of Lahabrea with this form, he then attempts to bind you in arcane chains, though Themis acts quickly enough to dispel the magic and spirit the three of you away. While Hesperos has not followed you, this incident does not bode well for the future of your investigation.</target>
