The great wyrm's words resonate with the people, overcoming their initial surprise and skepticism, and give them hope for Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han's future. This historic moment, however, is soon interrupted when Fourchenault and his colleagues from the Sharlayan Forum arrive with shocking news and an even more shocking proposal. The star they live upon is dying, and he would assist the people in escaping it to take refuge on the moon. Sharing his people's deep and abiding love for their home, Vrtra promises he will make no decision that binds them, and retreats with his guests to discuss the matter in private. Not moments after the wyrm and the Sharlayans have taken their leave, Nidhana reappears to share with you her latest theory that a force other than aether empowers the blasphemies and beasts─namely, an energy called akasa, said to be influenced by emotion alone. You ponder the implications of this potential explanation as Nidhana takes her leave and the congregated citizenry go their separate ways.</target>
