Though the observer in charge wishes to revert the specimen and its kind, having deemed them a lost cause, Hermes is loath to give up on them, and offers to transform in order to guide the creature skyward. The proposal is met with shock and dismay, for transforming in public is considered vainglorious and unseemly. While Hermes seems willing to bear the shame if it means saving the creatures, Emet-Selch is not wholly convinced. It is then that Hythlodaeus conceives of a solution. For this, he sends Emet-Selch off with the charybdis, while you and the others remain to assist him with the necessary preparations.</target>

The tale draws to a close just as the charybdis appears to find its wings, and Hythlodaeus bids you signal to Emet-Selch that he may return to the ground. A simple /wave should do the trick.</target>
