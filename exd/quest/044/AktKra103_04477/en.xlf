				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKRA103_04477_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;It transpires that Erichthonios's aim is not only to see his colleagues rescued, but also have the creatures contained within Pandæmonium returned to their confinement rather than destroyed. In pursuit of this goal, Themis agrees to lend the warder a portion of his power that he might use the powerful interment spell. As interment is usually only performed by the keywards, this stratagem must be tested first─upon the hippokampos which Erichthonios saw skulking in the waterways. The question of who is responsible for weakening the creature ere it is recaptured is a foregone conclusion.
