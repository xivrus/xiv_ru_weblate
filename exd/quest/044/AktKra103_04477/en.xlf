In pursuit of this goal, Themis agrees to lend the warder a portion of his power that he might use the powerful interment spell. As interment is usually only performed by the keywards, this stratagem must be tested first─upon the hippokampos which Erichthonios saw skulking in the waterways. The question of who is responsible for weakening the creature ere it is recaptured is a foregone conclusion.
