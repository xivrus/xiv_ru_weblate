The children's joy is reflected in Rudy's elated expression at seeing his confections bring so much happiness to those around him. His job done, it appears the little yeti has something to say to you.</target>

Rudy, however, has a thing or two to say to them. With your encouragement─and a confidence altogether new to him─he proudly tells them of how he created the greatest snowball cakes of his life, and helped spread joy to the children this Starlight. One taste of the treats in question is all it takes for his brothers to see how far Rudy has come, and they apologize for treating him so poorly all these years. Finally accepted by his family for who he is, it appears Rudy is ready to return to the mountains.</target>
