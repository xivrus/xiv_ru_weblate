        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMF101_04439_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Much and more has occurred during your sojourn to the First. Krile and Tataru offer a brief summary of the Forum's recent activities─of particular note, the plan to relocate Thavnairian refugees to Garlemald. Having learned of the device within the Tower of Babil, the Forum intends to utilize it to teleport them to the moon. Several of the Scions traveled to Camp Broken Glass to serve as an escort for the refugees, but have fallen out of contact since shortly after their arrival. Krile fears that the Final Days have come to Garlemald, and that your allies have come under attack, and so she urges you to rush to their aid.</target>
