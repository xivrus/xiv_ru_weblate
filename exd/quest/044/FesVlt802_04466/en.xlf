According to Kupka, tears were sparkling in her eyes as she fled the scene, and now, left only with a vague understanding of where she has gone, the postmoogle begs you and your friends' assistance in locating her. Astrid and Kupka Kupp are to search Greatloam Growery, while you and Pukty Piko are to head to Nophica's Altar.

Though she is delighted by the prospect of a life so happily situated with her beloved, she confesses to a worry she cannot shake: she is not noble herself. Heart heavy with doubt, she retrieved her letter, which contained her acceptance, before it could be sent off. Pukty Piko, now wiser to all things romantical in nature, insists she not give up so easily, and together with you and the other emissaries she writes her message anew. Kupka Kupp and Pukty Piko set off at once to see to the delivery, leaving Aloyse to wait for her darling's reply with bated breath.</target>

To everyone's surprise, Ezolmile makes an appearance and the two lovebirds leave to discuss their future in a more private setting. So touched is Pukty Piko by the sight of the happy couple that her pom transforms into the shape of a heart, and she becomes a full-fledged emissary of ardor and affection. Kupka Kupp, pink with pride, asks for her continued cooperation during these most jovial festivities.</target>
