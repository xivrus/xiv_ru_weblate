It would seem he finds himself at a loss regarding what sort of new gifts he should fashion for the children this year, and would have you join him on a stroll through the town in hopes the sights might inspire him. You resolve to accompany him to one or more scenic locations─chosen from among Apkallu Falls, the Lancers' Guild, the Leatherworkers' Guild, the marketplace, the watermill, and the Greatloam Growery─before making your way to Nophica's Altar.

※You must be accompanied by the Saint of Nymeia to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated.</target>
