        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMG106_04455_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;After discussing the collected results of your investigations of the island and its inhabitants, prospects for a path forward appear grim, until Y'shtola posits a theory based on Meteion's assertion that emotions dictate reality in this dominion of dynamis. Following Thancred's example, she suspects you must overcome the powerful emotions that maintain the island's current state. Hearing this, Urianger suggests speaking with Al End, a dragon whose sorrow is perhaps most pronounced among his kin. Countering his despair may serve to alter the island, and create a path by which you may advance.</target>
