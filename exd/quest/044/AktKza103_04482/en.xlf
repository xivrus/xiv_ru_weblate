However, just as he makes to get to work on the new pesticide, the Archeion's director, Vandealine, appears and forbids you from using such a potent solution due to its potential environmental impact. Though she is keen to take Shaggles back to his home amongst the meticulously catalogued specimens, he pleads for one last chance to solve the pest problem. Surprised by his display of sentience, Vandealine acquiesces, promising to cease treating the troll as a mere sample if he succeeds.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZA103_04482_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Obtain a poison gland from a luncheon toad.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZA103_04482_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Deliver the luncheon toad's poison gland to the Agronomics biologist.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZA103_04482_LITTLETROLL_100_000&lt;tab&gt;It was grrr enough when I thought these were normal woodworms...</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZA103_04482_NWELHITIA_100_001&lt;tab&gt;I suppose I should really return Shaggles to the Archeion soon...
