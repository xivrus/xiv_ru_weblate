However, just as he makes to get to work on the new pesticide, the Archeion's director, Vandealine, appears and forbids you from using such a potent solution due to its potential environmental impact. Though she is keen to take Shaggles back to his home amongst the meticulously catalogued specimens, he pleads for one last chance to solve the pest problem. Surprised by his display of sentience, Vandealine acquiesces, promising to cease treating the troll as a mere sample if he succeeds.</target>
