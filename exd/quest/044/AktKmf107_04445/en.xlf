As he bemoans his failure to complete his life's duty, Thancred arrives and mentions that Labyrinthos's people are feeling none too confident about their own work. Recognizing an opportunity to address both issues, Urianger suggests that Growingway offer counsel to one such researcher based on his expertise in constructing lunar environments─and the Loporrit hesitantly says that he will try.</target>

To his surprise, however, the next to arrive seeking assistance are Wilfsunn and Bloewyda─father and mother to none other than the dearly departed Moenbryda. Overcome by emotion, Urianger has naught but stammered apologies to offer them at first, though it soon transpires that they do not blame him in the least for their daughter's death, and have in fact been worrying over him much as they would their own child since they fell out of touch. At last, Urianger tearfully accepts Bloewyda's embrace, and affirms that he can feel Moenbryda's spirit with him, even now.</target>
