Alphinaud posits that a unit in a position of leadership may have availed itself of another body, and Alisaie conceives of a plan to ascertain its true identity by striking the console with lightning and gauging its reaction. For your part, you are required to closely observe the unit, M-017, while G'raha Tia diverts its attention with conversation. With the details settled, you set forth to carry out the operation.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKMG112_04461_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;M-017 reveals its true identity: part of the shared intelligence of Stigma-1, its duty to determine the optimal path for the Omicrons to achieve their prime function. The Omicrons, it explains, were born of a frail and feeble race whose members sought to defend themselves by enhancing their bodies. Yet what began as a desire for self-preservation became conquest for conquest's sake, until the Omicrons eventually grew so powerful as to have no equal. Bereft of a worthy threat, Stigma-1 found itself unable to perform its duty, and came to question its purpose and existence. To counter this civilization-ending despair, G'raha Tia brings his dreams to bear, and by his sacrifice paves the way forward in your quest.</target>
