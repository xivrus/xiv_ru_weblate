        <target state="final">TEXT_FESVLT801_04465_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Kupka Kupp, emissary of ardor and affection, finds himself overtaxed this Valentione's Day. To aid in his deliveries, his postmoogle betters have provided him with a fledgling courier by the name of Pukty Piko who, unfortunately, is ignorant in the ways of the heart. This postmoogle's cynicism is so dire, in fact, it threatens to spoil these romantic festivities entirely. To rectify the situation, Lisette takes it upon herself to enlist both you and Astrid in the aid of this hopeless moogle. The two of you are to accompany Pukty as she makes her rounds, all the while instructing her in the myriad meanings of love. Having assented to this scheme, the postmoogle and her chocobo companion make for their first delivery at the Carpenters' Guild, where she awaits you.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

Pukty Piko, eager to get on with her other assignments, is only moments away from dropping the package right where she floats, but is successfully stopped by both you and Astrid. You convince the moogle that the gift must be hand-delivered, so you set off for the Botanists' Guild, where you blindly assume the carpenter has gone.</target>

The once-surly man thanks you profusely, which leaves Pukty Piko perplexed: why such gratitude over a mere delivery? Astrid explains that joy, in all its forms, is meant to be shared with others, and that the man chose to impart some of his happiness to those who delivered his gift. The postmoogle appears receptive to this first lesson in love, and you set off for the next delivery at the Whistling Miller.</target>

The recipient, however, is overjoyed at the gift─an assurance of safety from a friend adventuring abroad, from whom she had been eagerly awaiting news. Pukty Piko thus learns that each person has their own unique way of sharing love and affection.</target>

His gratitude also inspires a strange sensation in Pukty Piko─which Astrid is pleased to inform her is none other than a form of love. With all three deliveries fulfilled and the moogle's inner life enriched, the time has come to return to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre.</target>
