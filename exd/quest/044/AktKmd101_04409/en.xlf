More disturbing than the rampaging beasts, however, are the words of Ahewann, satrap of Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han, who shares with you the revelation that the monstrosities that plague the city are his own countrymen, transformed by forces unknown. The largest and most fearsome of the creatures─dubbed a “blasphemy” by the local populace─has fled north after wreaking havoc on the city. The dragon Vrtra, guardian of Thavnair, and the Radiant Host have already been dispatched in pursuit, and the satrap would have you join them.</target>
