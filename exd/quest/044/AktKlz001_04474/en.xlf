Jude, however, seems unsure if he is deserving of your invite at first, but eventually concedes this is a perfect opportunity to showcase the starlens. After broaching the subject with Debroye, she is overjoyed to be presented with another chance to show the world just how delicious Mervynbread can be. Upon speaking with you, Hinageshi realizes she and Tankin are yet to hold their reception. She excitedly muses about taking advantage of this opportunity to honor her marriage to the professor as you take your leave. T'laqa Tia happily accepts your proposal as he is keen to keep pushing ahead to do justice to his mentor's legacy. Having spoken to everyone, you head back to Searchers' Meet to inform Qih that all will be in attendance.</target>
