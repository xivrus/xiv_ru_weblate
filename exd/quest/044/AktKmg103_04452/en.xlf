The gathering is interrupted by the arrival of Sicard, who has brought with him representatives of the world's myriad beast tribes. The reason for their presence, as Livingway explains, is to use the power of primal summoning to convert the Mothercrystal's energy into a form that can be transported to the ship's engines─for contrary to common belief, it is in fact possible to summon deiform beings without risk of being tempered. In light of this revelation, all present are willing to go along with the plan, and so the beastmen take their leave to prepare for the ritual.

As the beastmen contingent departs, Wilfsunn steps forward to offer you and the Scions teleportation devices he created for your mission. Designed to be used in tandem, they will teleport the Scions back to the ship in the event of an emergency. With no other matters left undone, Livingway boards the ship, and Fourchenault bids you do the same.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMG103_04452_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Ragnarok&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; trembles as its various components whir to life.
