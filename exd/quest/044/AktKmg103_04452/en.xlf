The gathering is interrupted by the arrival of Sicard, who has brought with him representatives of the world's myriad beast tribes. The reason for their presence, as Livingway explains, is to use the power of primal summoning to convert the Mothercrystal's energy into a form that can be transported to the ship's engines─for contrary to common belief, it is in fact possible to summon deiform beings without risk of being tempered. In light of this revelation, all present are willing to go along with the plan, and so the beastmen take their leave to prepare for the ritual.

As the beastmen contingent departs, Wilfsunn steps forward to offer you and the Scions teleportation devices he created for your mission. Designed to be used in tandem, they will teleport the Scions back to the ship in the event of an emergency. With no other matters left undone, Livingway boards the ship, and Fourchenault bids you do the same.</target>

A battle of words ensues, but is cut short when Meteion brings her power to bear, suffocating you and the Scions effortlessly. You fall to your knees, gasping for air. The last thing you see is Thancred charging at Meteion before the world fades to black.

You awake seemingly none the worse for wear, but with one less of your number than before─Thancred is nowhere to be seen. Thinking that he may have pursued Meteion, you and the others make ready to disembark.</target>
