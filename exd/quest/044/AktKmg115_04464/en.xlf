The familiar marshals the despair of countless ruined stars to arise as the Endsinger, and unleashes her might against you. Though you fight resolutely, one after another your comrades are overpowered, and it is all you can do to activate your teleporter and deliver them to safety. Just when it seems you must contend with your fearsome foe alone, help arrives in the most unexpected of forms─Zenos as a dragon. Though his foremost desire as ever remains glorious battle with you, he lends you his wings that you might first dispense with the distraction. Thus do you take to the air, to silence the song of oblivion once and for all.

In defeat the Endsinger falls, and you descend after her.

You share with her all that you felt during your journeys─from sweetest triumphs to bitterest defeats─and by this act, she finally finds the answer which she had sought all along. Filled with joy for the discovery and remorse for her deeds, she offers to sing one last song before she falls forever silent─a song of hope unbridled─and creates a path to deliver you back to your comrades. But ere you leave, Zenos arrives to issue you challenge. Though he allows you the choice to walk away, it is past time to put an end to this chapter─and him.</target>

Though you have felt better, you are very much alive, and make a triumphant return to beautiful Etheirys, having delivered salvation to the world.

Some time later, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn gather at the Rising Stones for the final time. For as has been decided, the order shall disband─albeit only in appearance. Having done its part to usher in lasting change, it will retreat from plain sight, and instead work unobtrusively to solve the problems that plague the realm.
