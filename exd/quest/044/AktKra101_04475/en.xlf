She explains that they have recently discovered a crystal of unknown nature, and asks that you take a look in the hopes that you have seen such a thing on your journeys. Nemjiji takes her leave and asks that you come to Claudien's laboratory in Aporia at your soonest convenience.</target>

You recognize it immediately as one of the ancients' design, and at a touch, it reveals to you a warning and a plea that you come to “Pandæmonium.” While much remains shrouded in mystery, it is plain that said location is not of this time... Thus does Claudien ask that you return to the past and seek the one to whom the crystal once belonged.</target>
