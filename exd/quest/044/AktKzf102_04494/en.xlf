The alchemist guesses that it was the work of an Arkasodara named Sula, who was not-so-discreetly eavesdropping on your previous conversation with Pasareen. Yezahn asks you to speak with the steward, both to offer your thanks and to find out what she may know.</target>

Sula then blamed Pasareen for the incident─an action which she has since come to regret deeply. While Sula seems eager to mend their friendship, she requires a moment to gather her courage.
