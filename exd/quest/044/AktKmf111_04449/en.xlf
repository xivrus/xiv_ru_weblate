        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMF111_04449_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;At Thaumazein's heart, Fourchenault explains that the bright blue and seemingly bottomless well of aether beneath you is the aetherial sea, and that the nearby shaft connects to the “Aitiascope,” a massive device by which the Forum peers into its depths to seek dialogue with Hydaelyn. Unfortunately, they have found little success since the Calamity weakened Her power, so you will be required to dive deeper than the Sharlayans ever dared if you would seek Her out. There, Fourchenault warns, drift memories strong enough to have escaped purgation by the cleansing tides, which may attempt to bar your path in death as they did in life...

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMF111_04449_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;With a little help from old friends, you fight your way past the vestiges of once-conquered foes to meet a soul but recently cast into the abyss, clinging to the world of the living even as he curses its hollowness. His parlor tricks are of no moment with the erstwhile Lady Iceheart shielding you once more, yet you struggle to destroy him once and for all. Instead, it is the vengeful spirit of Asahi who brings an end to the man that was once Hermes, many times Fandaniel, but Amon at the last, leaving the path to Hydaelyn open before you.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMF111_04449_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;At the Mothercrystal, Hydaelyn welcomes you warmly, and gives the answer you sought─Meteion and the despair over which she presides can still be overcome. She cautions, however, that to do so will require tremendous power, and that a failed attempt means an end to your star and all life upon it. Thus does She challenge you to take up arms against Her, the very god of Light whose voice has echoed in your heart for so long, and prove your worth.

But all was by design, for Her plans from time immemorial were a means to this end, in which man proclaims himself ready to dictate his own future. In parting, She bequeaths you three gifts─the crystal that shall guide you to Meteion, the Mothercrystal's aether to see you there, and Her own power to give form to the formless, secured in Azem's own crystal. The last of these, She cautions, is not to be relied on overmuch, for only within yourself will you find deliverance.</target>
