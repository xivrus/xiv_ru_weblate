Verpaulaine is chuffed that you're helping him.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI102_04485_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;After briefly explaining the artificial sun's inner workings, Verpaulaine bids you accompany him on a visit to Phoibos. You make your way to Logistikon Alpha so you can head to the Medial Circuit.

Though the Lalafell stationed at Phoibos says nothing, there is the distinct sense that he will be keeping a close eye on the youth during their tour.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZI102_04485_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Verpaulaine reports that he was unable to find anything amiss.
