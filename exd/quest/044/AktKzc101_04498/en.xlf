Rimelnaud would like your opinion on something.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="1" approved="yes"><source>1</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZC101_04498_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;You are approached by Rimelnaud, who wants you to accompany him when he goes to negotiate with an engineer from Tapper's Den. The man in question─Appius─is keen to restart Juturna Platform G, but Rimelnaud doubts his motives on account of his Garlean heritage.

However, the leaders of the contingent will need more than words to convince them that his plan is wise. Thus, the Garlean engineer suggests he inspect some of the camp's ceruleum engines that may be in need of repair to prove he can be trusted. At his urging, you agree to accompany him to make sure that he doesn't get up to any antics.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKZC101_04498_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Upon further discussion with Appius, it is agreed that you will be the one to actually inspect the ceruleum engines, lest something break and he be blamed for it.
