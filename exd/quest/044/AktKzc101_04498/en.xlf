However, the leaders of the contingent will need more than words to convince them that his plan is wise. Thus, the Garlean engineer suggests he inspect some of the camp's ceruleum engines that may be in need of repair to prove he can be trusted. At his urging, you agree to accompany him to make sure that he doesn't get up to any antics.</target>

Regardless of how you feel about taking the blame in his stead should that occur, you must concede that it would be better should a Garlean not incur the ire of the contingent by accident.
