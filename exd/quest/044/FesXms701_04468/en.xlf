				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESXMS701_04468_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Amh Garanjy welcomes you to this year's Starlight Celebration, and introduces you to her new friend─a diminutive yeti named Rudy, who appears to have something to say to her. Though you are at first at a loss to understand the words of the little snow creature, the auspice Rissai conveniently arrives on the scene. Through his interpretation, you learn of Rudy's heart-wrenching tale of rejection by his brothers, and his gratitude to the Saint of Nymeia, who saved him in his time of need after he became lost in the forest. Moved by his courage, you agree to aid him in expressing his thanks by serving as one of the saint's little helpers. Together with Rissai, you resolve to come up with a plan for how best to get Rudy involved in the Starlight Celebration.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

His role as a saint's helper decided, the little yeti's eyes light up with delight. There is one rub, however, in that neither you nor Rissai has experience in making this particular kind of confection. Fortunately, Rissai has just the person in mind, and along with Rudy you set off for the Carline Canopy to seek Mother Miounne's aid.</target>
