The Elezen seems well acquainted with the normal denizens of the area, but has never before seen the likes of that strange, ghostly flame. Though thrilled to have her property returned, she wonders if she will ever attempt to fish at Lilystone again.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBFST069_00385_BERTHE_000_2&lt;tab&gt;I was happily dropping a line into the water, you see, when I suddenly noticed some ghostly sphere of fire bearing down upon me from behind.
