Precisely what those gifts are to be remains to be seen, but what is clear is that Faezahr means to ask you to craft them.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM451_00301_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Faezahr bids you craft a pair of cobalt knuckles, a buccaneer's bardiche, and a cobalt shamshir worthy of his gladiator muse, Muriel.
