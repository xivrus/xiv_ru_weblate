The Paragon soon senses that you have lost Hydaelyn's blessing and teleports away, seemingly intent on taking advantage of the Scions' vulnerability. Moenbryda realizes that the staff Nabriales spoke of is likely Tupsimati, the relic once wielded by Louisoix himself.

With dismissive contempt, the Ascian reveals his plans to use the power yet hidden within the staff to bring about a new Rejoining. He then tears open a dimensional rift, through which he escapes with both Minfilia and the relic she holds. Follow Nabriales into the rift, and put a stop to his nefarious plans.

Before he can flee into the void, however, Minfilia succeeds in trapping the soul of the weakened Ascian within the chunk of white auracite. But try though you might, without Hydaelyn's blessing, you are unable to summon enough aether to truly destroy him. As she witnesses Light struggle to triumph over Dark, Moenbryda finally comes to understand her mentor Louisoix's dedication to his duty. The wounded scholar then expends her own life energy in a brilliant burst of aether, allowing your glowing blade to at last pierce Nabriales's essence.

A step too late, the rest of the Scions enter the solar to be greeted by the tragic news of Moenbryda's sacrifice. Somewhat comforted by the knowledge that his dear friend was, at the last, liberated from doubt and confusion, Urianger departs to grieve at the Waking Sands. Speak with the Antecedent to discuss the aftermath of the battle.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="6" approved="yes"><source>6</source><target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSE507_00369_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;Though assailed by her own grief, Minfilia yet worries more for Urianger and the loss he must be feeling.
