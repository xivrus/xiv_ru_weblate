You learn that she has ordered a rare flower in memory of her friend, which is currently awaiting collection at Rowena's store. Unfortunately, it would seem Yda finds the merchant rather trying, and is therefore reluctant to pay for the goods in person. Head to the store in your fellow Scion's stead, and use the purse provided to purchase the moon daisy.</target>
