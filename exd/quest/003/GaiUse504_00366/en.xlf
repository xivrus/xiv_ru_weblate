The astrologians of the Observatorium have interpreted recent signs as an indication of Midgardsormr's imminent resurrection. Alas, the knights of Ishgard are in no position to dispatch forces to the Keeper of the Lake at present, and so Ser Aymeric would have you investigate the wreckage on their behalf and ascertain the veracity of the astrologians' claims. Before proceeding to the Keeper of the Lake, however, Minfilia advises you to speak with a Doman watch who has been stationed on the northern shore.</target>

Alphinaud leaves to speak with Lucia, and for a moment you are left alone with Minfilia, who observes that you are somehow changed. Having no choice, you reveal what you kept concealed from the others─that Midgardsormr took from you the blessing of Light. The Antecedent accepts your reassurances that everything is well...yet Midgardsormr's constant presence is a reminder of the opposite.

Unaware of your new burden, Lucia thanks you for besting Midgardsormr, and for bringing confirmation of the impending Dravanian attack. Though she has complete faith in her nation's capacity to defend itself, Alphinaud remains doubtful, and as the knight takes her leave he mutters quietly to himself, head bowed in thought.</target>
