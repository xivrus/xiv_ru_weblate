        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM401_00300_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;As your reputation continues to grow, it seems even your guildmates have come to covet your wares. However, the forgemaster does not expect you to furnish your guildmates with the tools they seek; rather, he would have you craft a single wrapped crowsbeak hammer of impeccable quality to serve as a model for the other smiths. When it is ready, deliver it to Brithael for inspection.</target>

Only time will tell if your forgemates will rise to the challenge.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 45.</target>
