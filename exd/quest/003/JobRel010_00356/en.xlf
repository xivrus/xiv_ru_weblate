Instead, he proposes that the next step upon your journey towards the Zodiac Brave's arms is to recreate one's frame, and infuse it with the soul bound to your current relic. To those ends, he bids you seek four items:

- Literature on the Zodiac Weapons: seek out a merchant who deals in ancient tomes.
- Material for a new host: seek a master of crafting and gathering.
- Special sphere scroll: seek a scholar well versed in materia.
- Special alexandrite: seek a treasure hunter known for collecting precious stones.

※Upon collecting all four items, return to Hyrstmill and deliver them to Gerolt.</target>
