He also acknowledges that Limsa Lominsa's governing body is highly unlikely to divert resources to such a mundane endeavor while the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state is occupied with the threat of the beast tribes and the Garlean Empire. For the time being, he must be content with overseeing the tedious business of loading and unloading the balloons.</target>
