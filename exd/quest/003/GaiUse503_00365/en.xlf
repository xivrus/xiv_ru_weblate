Although Alianne struggles to accept that the single crate is the entirety of the shipment, Yuyuhase dismisses the discrepancy as Riol's failure. After you part ways with the three Braves, Riol steps from the shadows and begs a private audience, though he does not explain why. Seek him out at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange.</target>

He reiterates his claim that there should have been more weapons, crediting his experience deciphering financial transactions, as he once did for the Crystal Braves to ensure that no funds came from unsanctioned sources─though such precautions are no longer taken, it would seem. Apologizing for his outburst, he takes his leave, moments before Tataru summons you to Revenant's Toll via linkpearl. Return to the Rising Stones and speak with the receptionist.</target>
