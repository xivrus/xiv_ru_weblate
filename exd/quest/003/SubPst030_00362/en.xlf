Concerned upon hearing of the deputy postmoogle's plight, the tavern keeper promises to keep an ear out for any information that might serve to aid his recovery. In return, he entrusts you with a letter for Baderon of Limsa Lominsa's Drowning Wench, which was mistakenly delivered to the wrong establishment. Identifying the letter as having been delivered by his brash and overconfident brother, the young postmoogle asks you to watch over him as well.
