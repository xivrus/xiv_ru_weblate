To that end, the bookseller will part with a rare tome which details the Zodiac Weapons, but only if you can furnish her with the following rare items: a Bronze Lake crystal, a Bombard core, and a bottle of sacred spring water. The first of these may be found in the vicinity of the lake of its namesake.</target>

Rowena, the bookseller explains, has tasked her with incinerating those tomes that are unfit to sell, and only when this chore is finished can she turn her attention back to you. If you would obtain your book, suppress your desire to scream, and bring Papana a high-quality furnace ring and a bundle of perfect firewood.

Thanking you for your part in helping her dear friend get closer to financial freedom, Papana presents you with the object of your desire: the Book of Skylight. With the knowledge held within, Gerolt may now faithfully recreate such an arm as was wielded by the Zodiac Braves of legend.
