The gladiator is at first puzzled by the gesture, unable to understand the motives of your patron. However, when Faezahr delivers a cryptic message, the Bronze Bull immediately identifies your client as the Hellfire Phoenix, who he thought had perished in the Calamity years ago. He accepts the sword, proclaiming that he will one day stand atop the Coliseum and do it justice, and leaves without meeting your client. Speak with her and see if these events transpired as she desired.</target>
