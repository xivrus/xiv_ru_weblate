The knight brings grim tidings, and has come to seek the aid of the Crystal Braves and the Grand Companies in bolstering her city's defenses. She also bears a personal request from the lord commander, who wishes to speak with you. Travel to Camp Dragonhead in the Coerthas central highlands, and rendezvous with Alphinaud prior to meeting with Ser Aymeric.</target>
