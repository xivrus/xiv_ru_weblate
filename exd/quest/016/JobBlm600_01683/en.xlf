Knowing that his powers alone are insufficient─and despite Lalai's warnings of the inherent danger─he plans to control this monstrous voidsent such that all will fall in worship of him. Before he can enact his ghastly plot, Zhai'a Nelhah appears...and with reinforcements! Kazagg Chah, Dozol Meloc, and 269th Order Mendicant Da Za arrive to lend their strength, wisdom, and support. Waldeve's plan fails when, as predicted by Lalai, the voidsent turns on him, defeating him in an instant. This unspeakable, dangerous beast cannot be allowed to escape the Burning Wall. Slay it.

With the threat of the voidsent resolved, Zhai'a Nelhah steps forward to heal the grievous and brutal wounds that it inflicted upon Waldeve. The criminal is taken away into custody by Zhai'a Nelhah, who asks you to wait for him at Milvaneth Sacrarium, where he intends to thank you formally for your assistance in his investigation.
