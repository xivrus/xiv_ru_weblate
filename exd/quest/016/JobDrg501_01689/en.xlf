Though the Holy See's best dragoons have been dispatched to deal with the threat, they are sorely outnumbered and are struggling to gain the upper hand. Even now, a unit is locked in a fierce struggle northwest of Whitebrim Front, and is in dire need of reinforcements. Ser Alberic means to answer the call, and bids you join him.
