Alphinaud concludes that if the beastmen are truly only motivated by territorial gain, they must be unaware of the terrible price that their god's presence exacts from the land. Plainly, the creature must die. Citing the protection afforded her by the Echo, Ysayle volunteers to confront the primal, but Estinien is quick to point out that she lacks the means to call it forth. Speak with the inhabitants of Loth ast Vath, and learn more about the Gnath and their god.</target>
