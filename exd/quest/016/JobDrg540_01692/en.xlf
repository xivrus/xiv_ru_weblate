Alas, with the majority of her fellow dragoons absent, she can muster only a token force of defenders, and so Ser Alberic bids you lend your lance to the mission. Make haste to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly and join Heustienne ahead of her departure.</target>

Having given him your assurance, make now for the western highlands of Coerthas and rejoin your fellow dragoons.</target>

Together with Heustienne, you succeed in repelling the remaining enemy forces, but their leader, Graoully, is conspicuous in his absence. Just when it seems the dragon will not appear, his menacing shadow falls over you. Heustienne impulsively leaps at Graoully, piercing his hide with her lance, and you and Brucemont can only look on helplessly as she is borne away. Speak with Brucemont and see if aught can be done.</target>
