Therefore, the only way to ensure that the archbishop does not obtain the key to Azys Lla is to do so first. Before confronting the Vanu Vanu's patron deity, of course, it would only be prudent to learn more of its nature. Perhaps Lonu Vanu can furnish you with the information you require.</target>

Should the plan succeed, you would be able to engage Bismarck directly─but should it fail, you and your allies would be at the creature's mercy.
