Seeing no further need to delay, Estinien bids you fly with him to Nidhogg's lair forthwith. It would seem that the time has come at last to face the dread wyrm in a battle that could bring an end to a thousand years of suffering.

※Challenge the Aery with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA333_01634_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Following an aerial encounter with the enraged Nidhogg, you are separated from Estinien and land far from the duel between dragoon and wyrm. Undaunted, you cut a bloody path through the Aery's defenders, and eventually arrive at their master's lofty perch. There, with the Azure Dragoon stifling the source of Nidhogg's strength, you finally succeed in bringing the massive creature down.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA333_01634_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Glorying in victory, the Azure Dragoon gouges out Nidhogg's remaining eye, and sends the lifeless wyrm tumbling into the clouds below. Moments later, your Crystal of Lightning is suffused with new radiance, and you are treated to another vision of the past─a vision wherein you witness the truth of Nidhogg's defeat at the hands of Haldrath and his knights. When you subsequently relate the tale to Estinien, the dragoon seems greatly perplexed. If Haldrath claimed &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;both&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; eyes from the wyrm, whence came the trophy so recently plucked from Nidhogg's skull?
