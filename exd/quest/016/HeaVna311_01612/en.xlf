The young Scion contemplates the sobering issue of the Gnath's deity, and the need for additional information with which to plot its defeat. Professing to have little knowledge of Gnath culture, Ysayle suggests returning to Tailfeather to consult with Marcechamp. Speak with the village leader, and learn what he knows of the beast tribe's customs and beliefs.</target>

Slay clearwater nankas in the Whilom River, and gather hunks of flesh by way of an offering.</target>
