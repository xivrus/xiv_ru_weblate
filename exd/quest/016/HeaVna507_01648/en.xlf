Their commanding officer, whom you quickly deduce to be Regula van Hydrus, hears your approach and demands you reveal yourselves. Seeing no other way to ensure the survival of the captured Vanu, you obey, and soon find yourself face-to-face with Varis zos Galvus, the newly crowned Emperor of Garlemald.

Recognizing you and Alphinaud on sight, the Emperor surmises that the Scions of the Seventh Dawn seek Azys Lla in order to learn how the Allagans bound primals to their will. Pricked by Varis's presumption, Alphinaud musters the courage to decry the Empire's actions, only to be brushed aside by the Emperor, who orders his men to execute the captive Vanu Vanu regardless. Yet before they can carry out his command, the soldiers are sent reeling by a sudden barrage of cannon fire, and Lucia, piloting a suit of magitek armor, rushes to your side. Alert to the danger, Regula orders an immediate withdrawal, covered by the guns of the imperial battleship overhead, and though the resulting smoke obscures their retreat, the Emperor's voice─and its promise of a reunion─is unmistakable.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Concerned that imperial troops may have attacked the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enterprise&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; as well, Alphinaud bids you return to Cid while he and Lucia inform the Zundu of Bismarck's demise.

Alphinaud and Lucia return shortly thereafter and inform you that, miraculously, no Zundu died in the imperial raid. Reasoning that Varis would have leveled the Vanu settlement by now if that were his intention, Alphinaud concludes that the Emperor has already fixed his sights on Azys Lla. Happily, repairs to the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enterprise&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; are complete, and the hunt for the archbishop can continue in earnest.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Alphinaud.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Cid.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA507_01648_ALPHINAUD_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Though we failed to secure the key, we must not forget that we succeeded in ridding the realm of another primal─and prevented the Vanu Vanu's lands from being consumed in so doing.
