When the creatures appear, strike them down with your sublime lancework.</target>

Though Heustienne is a master of her art, it is all she has ever known. As such, it may prove a challenge for her to adapt. And like all of us, she is not without pride, and there will be times when tact is required.</target>

...But I am keeping you from your lesson. Heustienne left word that she would be in the western highlands, testing her lance against dragon spawn. Seek her out near the Pike.</target>
