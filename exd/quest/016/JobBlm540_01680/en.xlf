He explains that he was indeed approached by Waldeve. The man spoke of the Defiant and asked Da Za to share his knowledge of black magic. The wily kobold asked for time to reconsider, arranging another meeting and an opportunity to ambush the dangerous man with your assistance.

He seems to have recently come into ownership of an ancient tome left by Ququruka─no doubt the Book of Thal. Unfortunately, Da Za's cunning plan for capturing the renegade black mage failed to account for the possibility of the man simply walking away. Waldeve may be gone, but his cultists remain. They know of the secrets passed down to Da Za from his ancestor, and Ququruka's friend, Da Gu, and they plan to extract these secrets from him...by any means necessary.

Furious that this promising opportunity to question Waldeve's men has been squandered, he storms away to speak with Lalai.

Though Lalai sympathizes with his concerns, she points out that it was not just black magic that brought about the Sixth Umbral Calamity─white magic, too, was involved. In any case, she doubts Zhai'a's claims that you were not in full control of your powers, and proves as much by entrusting you with even more powerful magicks that she gleaned from the Book of Nald in your absence.
