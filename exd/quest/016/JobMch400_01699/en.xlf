It would seem that Svara, a dragon of great size and ferocity, is en route to Skyfire Locks─a collection of redoubts that House Haillenarte is honor-bound to defend. In response to Lord Baurendouin's dire need for reinforcements, Stephanivien pledges the participation of the manufactory's machinists. Speak with the chief machinist and discuss what is to be done.</target>
