Though apparently willing to open the way to Sohm Al's summit, the Dravanian declares that she cannot leave her post unguarded for fear of the Gnath's god. Suddenly, the beastmen's aggression begins to make sense─they act under the influence of a primal. Pausing only to seek your approval, Alphinaud offers to slay the creature, that Vidofnir might assist you in turn.</target>
