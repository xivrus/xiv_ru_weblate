Yugiri replies that the 3rd Unit Braves have abandoned Revenant's Toll in the wake of Ilberd's defeat, and that only soldiers loyal to the Crystal Brave commander remain. Upon hearing this, Alphinaud declares his intention to thank these stalwart warriors, and disband the company in person. It is time to return to the Rising Stones.</target>
