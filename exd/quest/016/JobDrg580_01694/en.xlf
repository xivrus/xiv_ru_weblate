				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBDRG580_01694_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Ser Alberic has learned the heretics' identity. Calling themselves the Bloodbearers, they have entered into a pact with Graoully, through which they have abundant access to dragon blood, making them exceedingly dangerous foes. According to Ser Alberic's source, the Bloodbearers have most recently been sighted in the Chocobo Forest. If his instincts serve, and Heustienne means to reclaim her lance Peregrine, she will surely go after them, presenting a chance for you to be reunited with her. Make your way to the Dravanian forelands and join Ser Alberic at Tailfeather.</target>

Ser Alberic is convinced that they are the Bloodbearers, here to replenish their stores. He bids you help him search the area for these so-called merchants. If you notice any suspicious individuals, confront them and gauge their reaction.</target>

As Ser Alberic predicted, she has come to recover her lance. Yet, though she has accomplished this task, she refuses to return with you to Ishgard. At Ser Alberic's insistence, she finally reveals the reason for her actions: when she was a prisoner of the heretics, she was made to drink dragon blood, and had already once turned into a dragon. Resigned to being judged a heretic by the inquisition, she declares her intent to go after Graoully, and Ser Alberic can find no words to change her mind. For now, rejoin Ser Alberic at the Observatorium.</target>

He bids you resume your training, all the while keeping your purpose close to your heart, that you may be ready to stand with Heustienne in her ultimate test.
