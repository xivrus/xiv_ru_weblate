A sudden visit from his father, however, serves to illustrate the difficulties the chief machinist faces in his attempts to subvert Ishgard's traditional way of thinking. After apologizing for subjecting you to his family squabble, Stephanivien then invites you to join him in eastern La Noscea, where he hopes to find a part for his latest invention. Speak with Rostnsthal in Raincatcher Gully, and continue your instruction in the machinist trade.</target>
