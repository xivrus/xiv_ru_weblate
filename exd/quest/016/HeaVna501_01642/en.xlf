Unfortunately, the airship was bound for the northern reaches, which are not easily accessible from Camp Cloudtop. In order to pursue the Heavens' Ward, you and Alphinaud will need to enlist the aid of a bold airship captain─and Alphinaud knows the perfect candidate for the job.</target>

Though he can offer no insight into the meaning of “Azys Lla,” he surmises that it is the source of some phenomenal cosmic power which Thordan VII covets. Recognizing the gravity of the threat, he agrees to help, and bids you join him at the airship landing when you are ready to depart.</target>
