He supposes that the voidsent's invisibility is uniquely suited to subverting Nymian wards. In the current day and age, however, he believes academics may know a way to reveal the unseen foe. Alka Zolka suggests that the Thaumaturges' Guild in Ul'dah may contain the sought-after information, and bids you speak with its receptionist, Yayake. Proceed there in hopes that the library holds a tome or two on the subject.</target>
