When the Temple Knights moved to stop them, the cultists fled the city. However, the trail has not been lost. Reports now reach the capital that the Defiant have been seen at the Convictory, in the Coerthas western highlands. However, the Convictors do not share the Temple Knights' resolute steadfastness. Travel to the Convictory and stop the Defiant before they can rally these impressionable young soldiers to their cause.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBLM580_01682_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;Though you were unable to apprehend Waldeve, Lalai sees this latest development as encouraging. The fact that the Defiant were forced to travel all the way to the frozen wastelands of western Coerthas would seem to confirm that they are growing increasingly desperate. If things continue in this vein, it will not be much longer before these renegade black mages are brought to justice. And when they are, the dangerous tome of dark magicks they have stolen─the Book of Thal─can be safely secured.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 60.</target>
