A response has finally come from the Temple Knights of Ishgard. The Defiant have been witnessed at the Holy See. Zhai'a Nelhah knows nothing of this nation and requests your assistance in following up on this sighting. Travel to the Arc of the Worthy in Ishgard and speak with the Temple Knights for more details concerning Waldeve's whereabouts.</target>

When the Temple Knights moved to stop them, the cultists fled the city. However, the trail has not been lost. Reports now reach the capital that the Defiant have been seen at the Convictory, in the Coerthas western highlands. However, the Convictors do not share the Temple Knights' resolute steadfastness. Travel to the Convictory and stop the Defiant before they can rally these impressionable young soldiers to their cause.</target>

Unfortunately, it seems that Zhai'a Nelhah has heard this, too, and has headed off to confront them without you. Find him before he gets himself killed.</target>

He apologizes for his hypocrisy in attempting to engage the cultists alone. However, he goes on to explain that he feared the Defiant mages would lose control of their powers if forced to defend themselves against a black mage of your skill. With, once again, no Defiant survivors to question, you are left with no leads. Return to Lalai and pass on Zhai'a Nelhah's apologies.</target>

The fact that the Defiant were forced to travel all the way to the frozen wastelands of western Coerthas would seem to confirm that they are growing increasingly desperate. If things continue in this vein, it will not be much longer before these renegade black mages are brought to justice. And when they are, the dangerous tome of dark magicks they have stolen─the Book of Thal─can be safely secured.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 60.</target>
