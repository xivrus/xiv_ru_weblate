        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBNIN580_01687_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The Truehounds' auction has come and gone, and the Yatsurugi clan's blade has been sold to an Ishgardian collector who paid extra to have the dagger taken directly to his home. Princess Yuki plans to attack the transit directly in order to reclaim the dagger. To make matters easier, Oboro then suggests that you swap the pirates' pluto for lavender incense, that you might use their dependence against them and send them to sleep. He proposes that the four of you split up. He and Akagi will find where the Truehounds are keeping their stores in Limsa Lominsa, while you and the princess will purchase the incense from Kyokyoroon in Hawkers' Alley. Yuki, as usual, takes off in a huff, leaving you to follow behind her with the sack of gil to pay the merchant.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBNIN580_01687_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Shortly after purchasing a sack of lavender incense from Kyokyoroon, Yuki receives an unpleasant surprise─a pair of her vassals from the Far East has come in search of her. The princess deftly avoids their gaze, and vanishes with Akagi. A bemused Oboro instructs you to leave the princess to him, and asks that you make your way to Fisherman's Bottom. Once there, switch the pluto for the lavender incense.</target>

However, Akagi was not exaggerating his lack of martial prowess, and has sustained a serious injury. The princess joins you, triumphantly announcing that the last of her clan's treasures is again hers. However, both you and Oboro feel the hair on the back of your necks stand up. You turn to see Redway standing but a few yalms away. Instead of attacking, however, the man offers an ultimatum: the princess comes with him, or her vassals who recently came to Eorzea die. Unable to refuse, the princess walks away, leaving you with a single command: tend to Akagi. Beaten, Oboro orders you all to return to the dock storehouse.</target>
