As the &lt;var 08 E905 ((woman)) ((man)) /var&gt; who has inherited Ququruka's legacy, Lalai believes that these tomes and the secrets they hold rightly belong to you. She bids you meet her at Nald's Reflection in southern Thanalan, there to search for the Book of Nald.</target>

As the tome is protected by an enchantment as its twin is, Lalai believes that there is still time to avert disaster. She expresses her intent to make discreet inquiries as to the location of the missing tome, and asks your permission to hold on to the Book of Nald for a thorough examination.
