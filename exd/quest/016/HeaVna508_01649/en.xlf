And so, with Lucia's magitek armor safely stowed aboard the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enterprise&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, you at last resume your pursuit of the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Soleil&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;.

As the land of the Vanu disappears into the distance, Lucia reveals her true identity. She is Lucia goe Junius, Garlean defector, and sister to Livia sas Junius, whom you slew in battle. Sensing your discomfort, Lucia claims to hold no grudge against you─and given her recent performance in battle, Cid is more than happy to take her at her word.

Some hours later, your comrade's calculations are confirmed when the clouds part to reveal the floating isle of Azys Lla. Alas, your progress is halted soon after by a powerful energy barrier which threatens to tear the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enterprise&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; apart. Frustrated, Cid turns the airship around and sets course for Ishgard, lamenting the Allagans' knack for making the simplest of tasks so infernally bloody complicated.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA508_01649_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;The thought of repairing the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enterprise&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; yet again is enough to fill Cid with dread.
