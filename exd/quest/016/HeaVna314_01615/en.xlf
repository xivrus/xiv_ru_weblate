Needless to say, she wants you to join her. Lacking any protection from the primal's influence, Alphinaud and Estinien will remain behind while you and Ysayle mount a mock assault upon the hive. Make your way to the main colony, and provoke the sentry stationed at the approach to Loth ast Gnath.</target>
