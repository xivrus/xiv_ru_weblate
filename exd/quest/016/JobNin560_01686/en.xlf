Captained by one Rosalinde, these cutthroats have made their name and fortune on the Far Eastern seas. What they lack in numbers, they make up for by imbibing pluto before boarding their victims' vessels.

Though the princess had wished to fight back, her vassals forbade it, and laid down their lives in her defense.
