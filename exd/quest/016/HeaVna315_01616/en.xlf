				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_HEAVNA315_01616_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You do not have to wait long before Lord Ravana, Master of the Sacred Blades and Wrath of the Colony, arrives to claim his sacrifices. Seizing the opportunity, Ysayle boldly questions the primal about his war with the dragons, before challenging him to a contest of might. Not one to shy away from a fight, Ravana accepts, and terms are duly agreed. If you prevail, the Gnath must cease hostilities with the Dravanians; but should Ravana emerge the victor, you will join his army as eternal thralls. Having goaded the primal into giving his word, Ysayle draws upon the energy of the Gnath's hoarded crystals to transform herself into Saint Shiva, and battle is joined. Even with Shiva's great strength, however, the heretic leader is no match for Ravana's flashing blades. As Ysayle sinks to her knees, defeated, the triumphant god's eyes alight on you. Take to the field and match your prowess against the self-proclaimed Conqueror of the World!

He is, however, correct. Make your way back to Anyx Trine, and share news of your triumph with Vidofnir.</target>
