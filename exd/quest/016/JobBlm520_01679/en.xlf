She speculates that the individual may have attempted to make contact with other black mages, namely your three beastman friends. Proceed to Burgundy Falls in eastern Thanalan and ask Kazagg Chah whether he has had any unusual guests of late.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;A glance is enough for Kazagg Chah to confirm that the robed man is not his assailant. Introducing himself as Zhai'a Nelhah, a Hearer of Gridania, he informs you that the Seedseer Council has sent him to find a certain black mage. Upon hearing of the Book of Thal, Zhai'a Nelhah believes that he may learn something useful from Lalai, and decides to pay her a visit. Return to Milvaneth Sacrarium in Ul'dah and be present for the meeting.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBBLM520_01679_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;In fretful tones, Zhai'a Nelhah explains that the man he is hunting, Waldeve, leads a cult of nefarious black mages. Waldeve was once a conjurer of Stillglade Fane, but he forsook the art of healing in order to sate his hunger for power. It seems clear that he is the thief who stole the Book of Thal, and with it seeks to unleash unspeakable destruction. Though their ideologies are completely at odds, in order to avert disaster, Zhai'a Nelhah and Lalai resign themselves to working with one another. After the Hearer takes his leave, Lalai teaches you a new spell─Ley Lines─which she deciphered from the Book of Nald. She bids you apply yourself to mastering the spell, and promises to let you know if there are any developments.

※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 54.</target>
