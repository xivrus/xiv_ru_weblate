				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_JOBNIN520_01684_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Unsurprisingly, the princess is displeased to see you, and has little to say about your offer of assistance. Akagi, meanwhile, all too gladly explains that the Salthounds are in possession of a trading record that is passing through the black markets. Somewhere within this log, he says, there should be information on the Yatsurugi clan's stolen treasures. After this explanation, the retainer then turns to ask Yuki to use you shinobi, only to find that she has already left to infiltrate the base. Oboro quickly outlines a plan to aid her entry: use smoke bombs to distract the guards. Make your way to the designated areas, and defeat any guards attracted by your diversion.</target>
