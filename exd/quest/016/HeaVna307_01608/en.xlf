While he and Alphinaud search for a supply of dry wood, you are to hunt down a number of lumbering yaks. Head to the yaks' territory, and obtain two of their hides.</target>

It is not long before Lady Iceheart herself arrives to investigate the signal. You explain your desire to parley with Nidhogg, but the heretics' mistress quickly dismisses the plan as futile. She relates the history of treachery that fuels the great wyrm's wrath, and Estinien, though disagreeing on the point of Nidhogg's present goal, concedes that the maddened beast is unlikely to listen to reason. Alphinaud then suggests that speaking with Hraesvelgr, another of the seven great wyrms, may provide a more promising chance at peace.
