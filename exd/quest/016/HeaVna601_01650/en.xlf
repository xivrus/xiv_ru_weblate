There is just one problem: he has not the faintest idea how to make one. Apparently, designing such a device would require the expertise of a true authority in the field─an authority such as an Archon. Even as Alphinaud laments their absence, Edmont recalls a discussion he had with Tataru, wherein she claimed to have acquired a clue pointing to the whereabouts of one of your missing comrades. Make your way to the Forgotten Knight and trouble her for the particulars.</target>
