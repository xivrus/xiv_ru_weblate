        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA601_01650_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Cid believes that it may be possible to pierce the barrier surrounding Azys Lla by mounting a ram of condensed aether on the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Enterprise&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. There is just one problem: he has not the faintest idea how to make one. Apparently, designing such a device would require the expertise of a true authority in the field─an authority such as an Archon. Even as Alphinaud laments their absence, Edmont recalls a discussion he had with Tataru, wherein she claimed to have acquired a clue pointing to the whereabouts of one of your missing comrades. Make your way to the Forgotten Knight and trouble her for the particulars.</target>
