        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH501_01671_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Surito Carito has terrible news: the sickness, the selfsame plague that deformed his people, has returned. Surito needs time to find a cure, and intends to place the worst ailing among his friends into magical slumber with the sealing enchantments of Nym. However, he needs keystones to do so, and would have you and Alka Zolka scour the nearby shores for one apiece. Travel to the Long Climb in outer La Noscea, and search for one of the outer keystones along the northern edge of Bronze Lake.</target>
