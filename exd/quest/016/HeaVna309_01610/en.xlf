Unconcerned by the recent change in the beastmen's behavior, Estinien urges the party to cut a straight path through to Sohm Al. Follow the forest trail to the Stained One, and defeat any foes who stand in your way.</target>

When Ysayle claims that the site is a remnant of the age when her ancestors and the Dravanians lived in harmony, Estinien accuses her of peddling heretic falsehoods, prompting an exasperated Alphinaud to step in. After demanding that the pair set aside their differences for the good of the mission, he declares that their debate will presently be settled by the indisputable visions granted you by the Echo. Though you know that your gift is rarely so obliging, you say nothing. It is time to move on.</target>
