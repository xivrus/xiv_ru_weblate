After once more instructing you on how to use the horn to summon Hraesvelgr, the moogle bids you a hurried farewell, apparently keen to return to Moghome. You cannot imagine why. Follow the path to Zenith, and blow the horn on the top floor of the palace.</target>

After scornfully dismissing Ysayle's claims to be Shiva reborn, he rebuffs your calls for peace, and recounts the tale of his brood-sister Ratatoskr's murder and the treachery of King Thordan. Man, he concludes, has brought nothing but misery to dragonkind. With that, the immense creature flies away, leaving you to ponder the cost of Nidhogg's eternal quest for vengeance. Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on this ill-starred encounter.</target>
