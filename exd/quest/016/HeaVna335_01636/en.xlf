Before he can come to a conclusion, however, the dragoon is interrupted by an urgent report from Ser Aymeric. It would seem that heretics have begun an uprising within the city itself. You return to Ishgard, and, with Ysayle's aid, seek to bring a peaceful end to the senseless destruction.

Upon entering the war-torn city, you are reunited with Lord Haurchefant. He quickly leads you to where a tense confrontation between the heretics and the Temple Knights threatens to explode into further violence. Lady Ysayle then tells her followers of the death of Nidhogg, and pronounces the Dragonsong War to be over. The heretics are thus persuaded to put up their arms, and retreat from the conflict at their mistress's command. Speak with Lord Haurchefant in the aftermath of the uprising.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Though Lord Haurchefant has convinced the incredulous knights to abandon any pursuit, he appears almost equally bewildered by this unexpected turn of events...</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak to Haurchefant.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_ESTINIEN_101_010&lt;tab&gt;Though he lifted not a single claw, 'twould seem that Hraesvelgr wreaked his own manner of vengeance against us...</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_ICEHEART_000_010&lt;tab&gt;And thus did betrayal beget unending vengeance...</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="50" approved="yes"><source>50</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_ESTINIEN_000_020&lt;tab&gt;Let us see how long this peace lasts...</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="51" approved="yes"><source>51</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_ESTINIEN_000_001&lt;tab&gt;（★未使用／削除予定★）</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="52" approved="yes"><source>52</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_HAURCHEFANT_000_002&lt;tab&gt;（★未使用／削除予定★）</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="53" approved="yes"><source>53</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_HAURCHEFANT_000_003&lt;tab&gt;（★未使用／削除予定★）</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="54" approved="yes"><source>54</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_ESTINIEN_000_0004&lt;tab&gt;（★未使用／削除予定★）</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="55" approved="yes"><source>55</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_ICEHEART_000_005&lt;tab&gt;（★未使用／削除予定★）</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="56" approved="yes"><source>56</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_HAURCHEFANT_000_006&lt;tab&gt;（★未使用／削除予定★）</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="57" approved="yes"><source>57</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA335_01636_HAURCHEFANT_100_050&lt;tab&gt;That was rather too close for comfort, but 'twould seem that calm is returning to the streets.
