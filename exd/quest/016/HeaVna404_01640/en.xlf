Correctly deducing that the revolutionaries have recruited knights in service to the High Houses, she asks Hilda to help by ordering these sympathizers to spread word of a heretic army massing outside the Gates of Judgement. Hilda agrees, but not before cautioning her that the deception will not last long. Ask Lucia what role she has in mind for you.</target>

Therefore, Lucia intends to divide her forces into two parties: yours to pursue Thordan VII and draw the attention of the Heavens' Ward, and hers to rescue Ser Aymeric during the ensuing chaos. Temple Knights still loyal to the lord commander have secured the entrance to the Vault. Speak with the squire outside to confirm that the others are in position.</target>

After exchanging glances, you and Lord Haurchefant rush headlong towards the vessel─but in your haste to apprehend your quarry, you fail to notice a transformed Ser Zephirin taking aim at you, a spear of pure light in his hand. Alert to the danger, Lord Haurchefant bellows a warning and raises his shield in your defense, but the steel gives way, and the spear finds a mark...

The airship forgotten, you and the others surround Lord Haurchefant, who lies upon the ground struggling to breathe. As Ser Aymeric cradles him in his arms, the fallen knight looks to you with a mixture of agony and relief, and bids you favor him with a smile...before the light leaves his eyes forever.</target>
