Though Alphinaud declares his intention to parley, the heretics are not inclined to trust his word, and the encounter quickly devolves into violence─an unwanted conflict from which you and your fellows emerge triumphant yet frustrated. With naught save the parting words of the retreating heretics on which to rely, you have little choice but to investigate the island known as the Dreaming Dragon. Speak with Estinien at the entrance to the Warrens, and plan the next step of your journey.</target>
