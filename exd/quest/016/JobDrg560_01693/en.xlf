Though it is unclear how the villains came to possess the weapon, they are all but certain to know of Heustienne's fate, and Ser Alberic is determined to track them down. A regiment of Temple Knights is presently on the trail of the selfsame heretics you seek. Make your way to the area west of Camp Riversmeet in the western highlands of Coerthas, and join the hunt.</target>
