Though it is unclear how the villains came to possess the weapon, they are all but certain to know of Heustienne's fate, and Ser Alberic is determined to track them down. A regiment of Temple Knights is presently on the trail of the selfsame heretics you seek.

Ser Alberic speculates that Heustienne means to go after Graoully and recover Peregrine. While he tracks down the leader of the heretics, he bids you continue dedicating yourself to your lancework, that you might be better prepared for the coming trials.
