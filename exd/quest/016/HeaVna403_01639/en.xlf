His attempts to defuse the situation only serve to rile the men further, however, and violence appears inevitable─until a raven-haired woman with ruby eyes appears, and commands Tataru's tormentors to desist. It would seem her name is Hilda.

As Alphinaud attempts to win the revolutionaries' cooperation─seemingly in vain─Ser Charibert, a knight of the Heavens' Ward, strides into the tavern, accusing you and the others of plotting insurrection. With no other options left to you, you accept his offer to step outside and face him in battle.

Joined by Lord Haurchefant and Lucia, you manage to overwhelm Ser Charibert, who withdraws. The joy of victory swiftly dissipates, however, when you learn that Ser Aymeric has been imprisoned, and the Heavens' Ward placed in command of the Temple Knights. Recognizing that the situation has come to a head, Hilda agrees to assist with the rescue mission.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="6" approved="yes"><source>6</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA403_01639_SEQ_06&lt;tab&gt;Recognizing your curiosity, Hilda explains that she took to calling herself “the Mongrel” out of a newfound pride for her mixed heritage, in spite of the discrimination she and others like her suffer. In the end, she declares, her followers have come to believe that the differences between lowborn and highborn are far greater than those between pureblood and mongrel. Thus united in purpose and pledged to Ser Aymeric's cause, they hope to bring about long overdue and lasting change.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA403_01639_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Search for Tataru in the Brume.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA403_01639_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Search for Tataru in the Brume.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA403_01639_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Hilda.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="27" approved="yes"><source>27</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA403_01639_TODO_03&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Hilda at the Forgotten Knight.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="28" approved="yes"><source>28</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA403_01639_TODO_04&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Hilda.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA403_01639_ALPHINAUD_000_000&lt;tab&gt;There must be a way we can draw the Mongrel out into the open.
