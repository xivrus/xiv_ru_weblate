Soon after, the strangers corner the trembling girl and seem set to do something unspeakable when Alphinaud accosts them from afar. His attempts to defuse the situation only serve to rile the men further, however, and violence appears inevitable─until a raven-haired woman with ruby eyes appears, and commands Tataru's tormentors to desist. It would seem her name is Hilda. In the taut silence which follows, she regards you with interest, waiting for you to state your reason for coming.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_HEAVNA403_01639_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;At Hilda's request, Gibrillont orders his staff to clear the Forgotten Knight and grant you privacy, after which you explain your reasons for coming in full. As Alphinaud attempts to win the revolutionaries' cooperation─seemingly in vain─Ser Charibert, a knight of the Heavens' Ward, strides into the tavern, accusing you and the others of plotting insurrection. With no other options left to you, you accept his offer to step outside and face him in battle.

Joined by Lord Haurchefant and Lucia, you manage to overwhelm Ser Charibert, who withdraws. The joy of victory swiftly dissipates, however, when you learn that Ser Aymeric has been imprisoned, and the Heavens' Ward placed in command of the Temple Knights. Recognizing that the situation has come to a head, Hilda agrees to assist with the rescue mission.</target>

In the end, she declares, her followers have come to believe that the differences between lowborn and highborn are far greater than those between pureblood and mongrel. Thus united in purpose and pledged to Ser Aymeric's cause, they hope to bring about long overdue and lasting change.</target>
