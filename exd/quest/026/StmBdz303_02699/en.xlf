        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ303_02699_MINE_000_002&lt;tab&gt;I would like for you to bring me back three water sprite cores, which can be obtained from the apas at Hells' Lid. They might appear frail, but do not let that fool you. They are by no means easy to defeat.</target>

Though we have been here for generations, we are still unable to consume seawater. These will allow us to remove the brine and turn it into freshwater.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ303_02699_MINE_000_012&lt;tab&gt;Normally, we send the strongest men from our village to procure the water sprite cores, but the Kojin of the Red have become suspiciously territorial of late. It has made approaching Hells' Lid extremely difficult for us.</target>
