Now we will have no need to worry about drinking water for some time to come. Though we have been here for generations, we are still unable to consume seawater. These will allow us to remove the brine and turn it into freshwater.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="54" approved="yes"><source>54</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ303_02699_MINE_000_012&lt;tab&gt;Normally, we send the strongest men from our village to procure the water sprite cores, but the Kojin of the Red have become suspiciously territorial of late. It has made approaching Hells' Lid extremely difficult for us.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="55" approved="yes"><source>55</source><target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ303_02699_MINE_000_013&lt;tab&gt;Thank you very much for your help.
