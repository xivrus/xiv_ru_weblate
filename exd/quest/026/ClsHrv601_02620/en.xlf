After attempting, and failing, to suppress the urge to gush about finally meeting you, her botanical hero, she explains that she seeks to cultivate a unique crop. It is hoped this crop, once created, would allow Idyllshire to trade more widely with its fellow cities.</target>

Edgyth, upon learning that she was in the presence of the first botanist herself, decides to wait for Fufucha's plan to take shape before taking any further action.
