Or so she thinks. Drawn by the crowds around the Leatherworkers' Guild, Marmaduke, a Hearer from the Conjurers' Guild, has taken notice and is repulsed by what he sees. He claims it to be an affront to the elementals and demands it be taken down.</target>

Certain they have dealt with and overcome similar opposition in the past, Atelloune asks you to seek counsel from Geva of the Leatherworkers' Guild.</target>

Satisfied with the fit, Geva goes on to elucidate her plan: she means to hold an exhibition of leatherworker wares using the jacket together with the dhalmel mount. The venue has already been set. All that remains is to assemble any mounts Atelloune would have on display.</target>
