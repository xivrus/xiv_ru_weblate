She has prepared for this undesirable outcome, however, by selecting another specimen for mounting─the majestic three-feathered gagana. To that end, she bids you and Enion make for Gyr Abania to locate this gargantuan bird of prey.</target>

It would seem the three-feathered gagana has not been sighted in the Fringes in quite some time. Some believe it may already be extinct. Just as all hope seemed to be lost, Enion has a stroke of genius. He suggests using the pelt of the more common variety of gagana to reproduce the visage of the three-feathered one. Before returning to Gridania, however, he insists on observing them briefly to ensure his mannequin properly conveys their likeness.</target>

It is not long before Atelloune's intended audience, Marmaduke, makes his presence known. He demands the exhibition be suspended forthwith, but Atelloune chooses to ignore his order. She instead goes on to explain how changes in the environment have endangered myriad animal species, and how people should make a better effort to protect them. Touched by her words, Marmaduke bids her continue, and teach the people of Gridania the value of the lives they would otherwise take for granted. The exhibition ends a resounding success, Atelloune completing her work with animal mounts, and Enion finding himself the newest recruit of the Leatherworkers' Guild. Atelloune means to spread learning and enlightenment to all corners of the realm, and she hopes the two of you might cross paths again someday.</target>
