It becomes apparent that there are two solutions to the issue, both recorded in the Sharlayan records Sawney and Edgyth had been examining. It is quickly established that neither alchemy nor companion farming will avail on their own, and Fufucha recommends you utilize a mixture of the two. You are instructed to head to Castrum Oriens in order to search for a flower named Rhalgr's streak that will form a key part of Fufucha's plan.</target>
