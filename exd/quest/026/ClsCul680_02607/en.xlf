Though it may sound simple, it is said to be an indulgence of the highest order and is nigh impossible to make without training under a proper master in Hingashi. As he is unable to abandon his job at the restaurant, Raulf begs you make the long journey in his stead to learn the basics of sushi-making. Set forth for the Hingan port of Kugane, and upon arrival seek out an inn called the Bokairo, where one of the realm's foremost sushi chefs is to be found.</target>

Though it comes with a caveat, he offers praise for your handiwork. And while Raulf's falls well short of impressing, his earnest effort is acknowledged, and he dares to hope that Unzan finally approves of him and Anzu. Alas, his hopes are swiftly crushed, for Unzan reveals his true reason for rejecting Raulf: his Ala Mhigan blood. Theirs is the proud blood of Yanxia, Unzan explains, and only a man of equally pure lineage is fit for his daughter. Dejected, Raulf decides to return to being an adventurer and walks off as Anzu looks on in dismay. With both her father and fiancée having left, it falls to you to reach out to her in this difficult moment.</target>
