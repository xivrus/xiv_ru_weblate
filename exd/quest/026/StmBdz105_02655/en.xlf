He speaks of a man named Sayer, one of the town's former quarriers, and the only one that has shown any real desire to revive the flagging industry. Raganfrid points you in his friend's direction and you head off to hear what he has to say.</target>

It soon becomes clear that he wishes to revitalize the quarry in order to bring prosperity back to the village. However, the lack of support Sayer has becomes abundantly obvious when you witness that even his own granddaughter does not believe in his dream.</target>

You are instructed to bring back two urolith soulstones as proof that you have completed the task.</target>
