Simple as the dish seemed, Raulf tried making it himself, but the Domans were less than impressed with the results. Polite a people as they are, however, they will not tell him straight what he did wrong, and it falls to you to seek them out in town and ask their honest opinion.</target>

Believing that you will do a better job, he asks you to try your hand next. Prepare your finest set of Doman rice balls and bring it outside for Raulf to hand out to the gathered Domans.

As he marvels at how you harnessed the best qualities of rice, a Doman woman named Anzu appears and affirms that such is spirit of Far Eastern cuisine: to respect each ingredient and allow it to shine. Her sudden arrival causes Raulf to break out in panic, and she soon takes her leave, satisfied that he is in good hands.
