Like you, the individual in question is an adventurer-cook, and owing to this he sees you as an inspiration. Take yourself to the Bismarck's dining area and seek out a man named Raulf.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL601_02604_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Raulf tells you of his efforts at being an adventurer and culinarian both, but juggling two careers has led to lackluster results. Recognizing his limits, he has resolved to focus purely on the culinary arts and has taken up a post at Rowena's café. In order to distinguish himself in this crowded profession, he intends to incorporate Far Eastern dishes into the menu and cater to the local Doman population. However, he concedes that it is no easy task to master a foreign cuisine, and so he has come to you for aid. If you are willing to lend your expertise, take yourself to Revenant's Toll and seek out Raulf at Rowena's House of Splendors.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL601_02604_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Raulf is ecstatic that you have agreed to help him. Using his connections, he will look into what the local Domans desire to eat. Until he identifies a likely dish to test out, continue applying yourself to your craft in readiness for venturing into the culinary unknown.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Raulf upon reaching level 63.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL601_02604_RAULF_000_014&lt;tab&gt;The thing is, with or without distractions, it's not easy to succeed as a chef. It's a crowded profession, as I'm sure you can appreciate, and if I'm to make a name for myself, I can't be making what everyone else is making. Nay, I need to venture into unexplored territory.</target>

It's plain I'm going to need help, and of the well-traveled sort. And so I decided to turn to the most accomplished adventuring culinarian I know─you, &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;.</target>
