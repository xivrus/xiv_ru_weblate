Recognizing his limits, he has resolved to focus purely on the culinary arts and has taken up a post at Rowena's café. In order to distinguish himself in this crowded profession, he intends to incorporate Far Eastern dishes into the menu and cater to the local Doman population. However, he concedes that it is no easy task to master a foreign cuisine, and so he has come to you for aid. If you are willing to lend your expertise, take yourself to Revenant's Toll and seek out Raulf at Rowena's House of Splendors.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL601_02604_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Raulf is ecstatic that you have agreed to help him. Using his connections, he will look into what the local Domans desire to eat. Until he identifies a likely dish to test out, continue applying yourself to your craft in readiness for venturing into the culinary unknown.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Raulf upon reaching level 63.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL601_02604_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Raulf.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL601_02604_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Raulf at Revenant's Toll.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL601_02604_LYNGSATH_000_000&lt;tab&gt;Ah, good timin', &lt;var 08 E905 ((lass)) ((lad)) /var&gt;.
