When you inform him that you are acquaintances with their head of shop in Kugane, he begs you to meet with his superior, Tsukikage, who has been looking to establish a new trading partner. He then points you in the direction of Crick, where you can find him. If you are feeling generous, make your way there and speak with Tsukikage.</target>

He thinks they are lying to avoid paying the Ruby Tithe. For fear of incurring the wrath of a potential business partner, however, he would like to make absolutely certain before seeking retribution and requests your help with this endeavor. Asking that you take the flag he obtained from their ship along with a list of the items they found aboard the vessel, he would like for you to present it to one of the merchants in the Kugane branch office and inquire if any of it belongs to their organization.</target>

Right before you turn to go, she asks you to get in touch should the Confederacy be looking to sell any of what they confiscated. Tsukikage should be delighted to hear the news.</target>
