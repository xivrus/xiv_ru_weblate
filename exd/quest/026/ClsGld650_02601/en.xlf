Synthesize a pair of spectacles for J'khebica, and present the finished product to your deputy for inspection.

Wido observes that, even in her semiblind state, J'khebica was still the better goldsmith, and he and Hal are spurred to greater effort. In this way, all three apprentices resume their training with the fire of their enthusiasm further stoked. Let their zeal inspire you as you continue striving for new heights in your craft.
