In spite of her many promising qualities, it turns out she is remarkably clumsy, suffering repeated mishaps while applying the finishing touches. Unable to discern the cause, Emeloth bids you look in on the struggling apprentice. Speak with J'khebica and her fellows to see what you might be able to glean.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSGLD650_02601_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You learn from J'khebica that her struggles are relatively new. Meanwhile, the two brothers offer further insights, namely that she cannot reliably distinguish between the two of them, and that she invariably furrows her brows prior to failing. Take these revelations back to Emeloth for her consideration.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSGLD650_02601_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;It quickly becomes apparent that J'khebica's eyesight has deteriorated beyond what her current spectacles are able to correct. Kanchana suggests that you make her a new pair, which would double as the sample for the next task Emeloth has in mind for the apprentices. Synthesize a pair of spectacles for J'khebica, and present the finished product to your deputy for inspection.

※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Kanchana.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSGLD650_02601_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;The new spectacles do the trick, and J'khebica is fairly enraptured to have her vision back. Wido observes that, even in her semiblind state, J'khebica was still the better goldsmith, and he and Hal are spurred to greater effort. In this way, all three apprentices resume their training with the fire of their enthusiasm further stoked. Let their zeal inspire you as you continue striving for new heights in your craft.

※The next goldsmith quest will be available from Emeloth upon reaching level 68.</target>
