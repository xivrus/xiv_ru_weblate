He claimed he had come to bestow divine protection upon her sister, the Ruby Princess, but instead called forth a flood of voidsent beasts and spirits, which possessed the Sui&lt;var 1F /var&gt;no&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Sato ruler and her guards. Seeing this, Shiosai evacuated all those not under the influence of the void and placed a seal over the palace. However, the seal is threatening to break, and Shiosai intends to drown Shisui of the Violet Tides and everyone in it. You and Kurenai must convince him to do otherwise.</target>
