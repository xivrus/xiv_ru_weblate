        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ013_02647_GELEN_000_002&lt;tab&gt;I'd repair it myself, but I don't have the necessary materials. Do an old woman a favor and slay three earth sprites. You'll find some by the Ziggurat. Bring back their cores and we'll see if this house can't be fixed.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ013_02647_GELEN_000_023&lt;tab&gt;Apparently the very ground we stand on used to be part of the quarry. Then, one day someone decided to start using it as a rest area. Eventually a house was built here─one thing led to another─and, before anyone knew it, a whole settlement had popped up.</target>
