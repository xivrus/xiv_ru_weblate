As he tells it, he took to working on mounted animals as a hobby, but soon found himself in service to Atelloune who greatly overestimates his abilities. He is hopeful your leatherworking prowess will make up for his ineptitude for working animal hides. Aware of the hour, he bolts off back to the Shaded Bower, lest he incur Atelloune's anger. It may be in your best interest to follow his example.</target>

More importantly, she is satisfied to have at last found two artisans to complement one another for the task at hand─one inexperienced in working leather, the other untrained in preparing animal mounts. Ready your awl, for there will be much to do once preparations are complete.

※The next leatherworker quest will be available from Atelloune upon reaching level 63.</target>
