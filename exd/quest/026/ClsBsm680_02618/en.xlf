He takes one glance at her katana and is immediately displeased. Sekka, however defends her blade, saying that while it may not look like much, forging it reminded her of the joy of smithing. Those words seem to be exactly what Shinto was waiting to hear. He tells her she has learned a valuable lesson as a swordsmith, but if she is to become his apprentice there is one last thing she must prove: her worth. She must face off against you to see who can make the better katana. Declaring the contest will take place in Kugane, Shinto then bids you and Forgemaster Brithael to meet him and his daughter there.
