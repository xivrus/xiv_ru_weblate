Wanting to learn exactly what that reason could be, he would have you go and speak with Shinto on the matter. Make your way to West Hawkers' Alley and speak with Sekka's father.</target>

Speculating that her clunky old tools are preventing her from demonstrating her true skill as a swordsmith, he would have you help him forge her a new set. Asking that you make a custom-made hammer, he then sends you to speak with Randwulf, who will provide you with all the materials you will need.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM680_02618_SEQ_07&lt;tab&gt;As you speak with Sekka, Shinto strides in. He takes one glance at her katana and is immediately displeased. Sekka, however defends her blade, saying that while it may not look like much, forging it reminded her of the joy of smithing. Those words seem to be exactly what Shinto was waiting to hear. He tells her she has learned a valuable lesson as a swordsmith, but if she is to become his apprentice there is one last thing she must prove: her worth. She must face off against you to see who can make the better katana. Declaring the contest will take place in Kugane, Shinto then bids you and Forgemaster Brithael to meet him and his daughter there.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 70.</target>

It made me realize that until now, my katana have been made with anxiety─a fear of being rejected─and not for the pure joy of the art.</target>
