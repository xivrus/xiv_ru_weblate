Instead of going there in person to negotiate with Kikimo, he would like for you to deliver a letter which outlines his preferred terms and conditions. He, however, does not have the aforementioned missive on his person, and asks that you accompany him to the nearby guardroom. Go with him and receive the letter.</target>

After quickly scanning it, the East Aldenard Trading Company representative tells you she would be happy to accept the conditions he has outlined in the document. She then goes on to say that if the Confederacy manages to procure a few other luxury items from the Ruby Sea in addition to those listed in the captive ship's inventory, she would be willing to pay them handsomely. She then hands you a letter of her own containing a contract for Tsukikage to look over and sign. See that it makes it to the Confederacy treasurer.</target>

He is pleased to hear that not only did she accept his terms but offered the Confederacy additional coin in exchange for obtaining luxury items exclusive to the Ruby Sea─the fins of a soaring shark, teardrop pearls, and the shell of a decade-old turtle. Eager to begin, Tsukikage starts to divvy up the work, but before he can finish Hansaku rushes off to procure the fins. Worried he has gotten ahead of himself, Tsukikage asks that you go after him.</target>
