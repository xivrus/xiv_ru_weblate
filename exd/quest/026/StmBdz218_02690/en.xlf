To do harm to a fellow Confederate, however, is considered to be an act of treason and he fears if someone does not quickly put a stop to all this, he will lose not one, but two of his subordinates.</target>

Together, you manage to convince her to put off her plans to murder Hansaku until after Kikimo receives her delivery. Under Tsukikage's orders, Hansaku and Suzume then set off to secure the area and dispatch of any remaining beasts. The Confederacy treasurer leaves to take care of the remainder of the shipments but before returning asks that you stay behind to help clear the area of beasts and keep an eye on Suzume.</target>

Now that everything has been peacefully resolved, the Confederates must turn their attentions back to the matter at hand: seeing that Kikimo receives her delivery.
