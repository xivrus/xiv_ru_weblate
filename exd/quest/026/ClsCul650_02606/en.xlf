For such complaints, nothing is better than &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;udon&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, a bowl of noodles in a light and warming broth, and Raulf has a mind to serve it up for the old ones.

Raulf eagerly offers to buy it from her, but the Sirens captain informs him that she has ordered it all discarded. Just when it seems you must travel all the way to the Far East, Melkoko comes in with glad tidings: she has held on to the dried fish. Raulf volunteers to grab the stuff from the storehouse, and bids you join him back in his kitchen at Revenant's Toll.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="5" approved="yes"><source>5</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL650_02606_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;Back at Revenant's Toll, you and Raulf set about making udon.

Her father refuses to accept a vagrant adventurer for a son-in-law, and so Raulf decided to give up the adventuring life in order to focus on cooking. The choice of Far Eastern cuisine, too, was for the sake of gaining approval, but therein lies a problem: Unzan himself is a chef of no small renown, who had his own prestigious restaurant back in Doma. But no matter the difficulties, Raulf is determined to succeed as a culinarian and win Unzan over, and he expresses his hopes that he can continue depending on your help.
