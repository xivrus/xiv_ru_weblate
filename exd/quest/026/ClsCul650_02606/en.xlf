        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL650_02606_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;In the course of considering new Far Eastern dishes, Raulf has learned that elderly Domans often suffer from upset stomachs due to the rich and greasy foods that are common to Eorzea. For such complaints, nothing is better than &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;udon&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, a bowl of noodles in a light and warming broth, and Raulf has a mind to serve it up for the old ones. The broth is made by boiling dried fish, and it is decided that you will go to Limsa Lominsa to source the finest stuff available. Start by paying a visit to the Bismarck and consulting Lyngsath.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL650_02606_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Lyngsath recommends you use authentic Far Eastern dried fish to make the udon broth. As luck would have it, a Kraken's Arms ship recently seized a merchantman in Far Eastern seas, and the ingredient you seek may well be among its cargo. Take your search to the Seventh Sage and ask Carvallain whether he has what you require.</target>

Seek out Rhoswen at the Missing Member and hope the Twelve that she hasn't likewise cast it away.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSCUL650_02606_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;In disgusted tones, Rhoswen confirms having accepted the dried fish from Carvallain. Raulf eagerly offers to buy it from her, but the Sirens captain informs him that she has ordered it all discarded. Just when it seems you must travel all the way to the Far East, Melkoko comes in with glad tidings: she has held on to the dried fish. Raulf volunteers to grab the stuff from the storehouse, and bids you join him back in his kitchen at Revenant's Toll.</target>

Much to his relief, the dish is well received, but the triumph is short-lived, for Anzu's father, Unzan, arrives soon after and proceeds to heap scorn upon Raulf. Sampling the udon, Unzan awards your broth a passing grade, but tears Raulf's noodles apart while managing another disparaging comment at its maker, and takes his leave. Reach out to your brother culinarian to see how he fares after the unpleasant confrontation.</target>

Her father refuses to accept a vagrant adventurer for a son-in-law, and so Raulf decided to give up the adventuring life in order to focus on cooking. The choice of Far Eastern cuisine, too, was for the sake of gaining approval, but therein lies a problem: Unzan himself is a chef of no small renown, who had his own prestigious restaurant back in Doma. But no matter the difficulties, Raulf is determined to succeed as a culinarian and win Unzan over, and he expresses his hopes that he can continue depending on your help.

※The next culinarian quest will be available from Raulf upon reaching level 68.</target>
