Sayer tells you to protect him while he investigates the site where he hopes to find the precious stone mentioned in the lyrics. Realizing there is no room to deny his pseudo-request, you prepare to set off for the Ziggurat.</target>

Just as Swetelove hears her grandfather reciting the work song, she recalls that there was an alternate version of the tune's lyrics.
