        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ206_02678_HAYAMA_000_001&lt;tab&gt;I was surveying these waters just now and spied a young pirate boy being attacked by sea monsters. While he made it back to the coast of Sakazuki, they have followed him. I fear he will not last for long without help.</target>
