According to him, ever since Sekka began her studies at the guild, she has taken to wandering the floors and criticizing everyone's work. Upon giving her a stern talking to about her unpleasant manner of conduct, she became upset and left in a flurry of angry words. It seems, however, this is not the first time she has stormed out over this very same argument, and Brithael asks that you try talking to her in his stead.

She tells you this is the root cause for the lack of self-improvement she has observed in all the guild members. She believes things should be run differently and tells you she intends to prove it to you.

She said she intends to face off with a member of the forgemaster's choice to see who can better satisfy the next request which comes into the guild. Brithael would, of course, have you be the one to take her up on her challenge. It would seem fate is already in your favor, as the latest order you have received is from a customer you already know, and they are waiting to discuss the details of what they would have you make. Go to the Drowning Wench and speak with them.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM630_02616_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;As it conveniently turns out, Laurisse and Fremondain─the acquaintances you made in Ishgard─are your clients. They have come to have a sword forged for Fremondain so that he might have a means to protect himself when Laurisse's duties take her to distant lands for extended periods of time. Fremondain, telling you that he has grown frail in his old age, says he would prefer something light and easy to handle. Using the materials Laurisse provides, produce a high-quality featherlight shortsword and deliver the finished product to Brithael for inspection.

Flabbergasted, she attempts to convince him that hers beats yours in durability and sharpness, at which point Laurisse steps in to say that they are in fact of a comparable quality in both those aspects. Your sword, however, is more desirable because it takes into consideration the physical limitations of its wielder. Sekka, unwilling to accept defeat continues to argue, and Brithael then suggests she look to switching career paths because her attitude is unbecoming of a craftsman. Realizing her mistake, she reflects upon her conduct and apologizes for her outburst and earlier behavior before vowing to begin taking her studies at the guild more seriously.

※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 65.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="24" approved="yes"><source>24</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM630_02616_TODO_00&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Sekka.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="25" approved="yes"><source>25</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM630_02616_TODO_01&lt;tab&gt;Speak with Brithael.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="26" approved="yes"><source>26</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM630_02616_TODO_02&lt;tab&gt;Speak with the client at the Drowning Wench.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="27" approved="yes"><source>27</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM630_02616_TODO_03&lt;tab&gt;&lt;var 08 E3E802E803 ((Synthesize a featherlight shortsword &lt;var 28 ((Addon)) 0A01 /var&gt;)) ((Deliver the featherlight shortsword &lt;var 28 ((Addon)) 0A01 /var&gt; to Forgemaster Brithael)) /var&gt;.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="48" approved="yes"><source>48</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM630_02616_BRITHAEL_000_000&lt;tab&gt;&lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt;, it's been absolute hell ever since that thrice-damned shrew ye dragged back from the docks set up shop at our guild.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="49" approved="yes"><source>49</source><target state="final">TEXT_CLSBSM630_02616_BRITHAEL_000_001&lt;tab&gt;From the crack o' dawn to sundown she prowls the floors lookin' to find fault with every one o' me smitties' work.
