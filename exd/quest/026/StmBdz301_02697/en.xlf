        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ301_02697_SEIZAU_000_011&lt;tab&gt;These cuts you have brought me are beautiful. Excellent work. I have, for far too long, craved the taste of bird meat. You see, many years ago, a cage fell from a ship passing above. Within it was a bird. The moment its flesh touched my lips I knew no food, however fine, could compare.</target>

You do not look as though you can fly, so how is it that you were able to capture these magnificent winged creatures?</target>
