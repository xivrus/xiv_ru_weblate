				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_STMBDZ301_02697_SEIZAU_000_011&lt;tab&gt;These cuts you have brought me are beautiful. Excellent work. I have, for far too long, craved the taste of bird meat. You see, many years ago, a cage fell from a ship passing above. Within it was a bird. The moment its flesh touched my lips I knew no food, however fine, could compare.</target>

If I'm not mistaken, birds have appendages that allow them to soar the skies. You do not look as though you can fly, so how is it that you were able to capture these magnificent winged creatures?</target>
