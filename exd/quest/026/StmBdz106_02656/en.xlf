        <target state="final">TEXT_STMBDZ106_02656_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;You talk to a few of the villagers, enjoying varying degrees of failure. It is made abundantly clear that while you were more than capable of taking on a group of uroliths, most villagers are not. You begin to realize that the general consensus of the village has long been that there is no future in mining. Finally, you happen upon Sayer's granddaughter, Swetelove, once again and discover that she would like nothing more than for her grandfather to retire once and for all.</target>

Regrettably, none of the villagers except Swetelove choose to follow you back to him. She does her best to convince her grandfather to give up on his dream of restoring the quarry, but her words only serve to further stoke the fires of Sayer's paranoia. Eventually Sayer gets so frustrated arguing that he storms off, leaving you and Swetelove alone. She bids you go and try to calm him down on her behalf.</target>

Upon seeing you he quickly embarks on a trip down nostalgia lane, reminiscing about how the quarry used to provide for the entire village. It is these memories which convince him of a new solution to his current predicament: work songs. You contemplate this new plan's chances of success as the former quarrier becomes increasingly more confident in the power of music.</target>
