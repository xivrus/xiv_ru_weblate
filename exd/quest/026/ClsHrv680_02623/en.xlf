        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSHRV680_02623_EDGYTH_000_103&lt;tab&gt;The way it responded to the reagent doesn't leave much room for doubt. It's an eelworm: a pest that is not going to do us any favors. The chalky stone-like object that &lt;var 2C ((&lt;var 29 EB02 /var&gt;)) (( )) 02 /var&gt; found was one of its eggs.</target>

As parasites, eelworms require a host plant to feed on. The Mudplots were only created recently─just why were the eggs of such vermin lurking in the area?</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSHRV680_02623_EDGYTH_000_105&lt;tab&gt;According to the Sharlayan records Sawney looked at, eelworm eggs enter a state of dormancy within their mother's corpse, allowing them to survive for over a decade. They're more than capable of waiting for as long as is necessary for new grub to show up.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_CLSHRV680_02623_SAWNEY_000_106&lt;tab&gt;The blasted records also claimed that they'd all been exterminated. Either the Sharlayans have a funny definition of the word, or we were unlucky enough to pick an area that was home to an eelworm corpse or two─the eggs inside which hatched and infested the Mudplots.</target>
