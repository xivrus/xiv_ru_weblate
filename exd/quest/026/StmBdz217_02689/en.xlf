As such, she must return once to the port city and bring back a larger vessel. Tsukikage suggests meeting at the far north of Sakazuki to ensure the transaction goes through smoothly. To prepare for her arrival, he would have Hansaku clear the northern area of wild beasts while Suzume rests at the guardroom to recover from her pearl-diving injuries and he and you see that the goods make it safely to the other side of the island.</target>
