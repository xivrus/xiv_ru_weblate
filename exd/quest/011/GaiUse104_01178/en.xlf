After praising Minfilia for her victories over the Empire, F'lhaminn states that the Scions must leave Ul'dah behind if they are to continue their work. Agreeing at last to Alphinaud's proposal, a reinvigorated Minfilia declares that the order will quit Vesper Bay and establish a new headquarters in Revenant's Toll.</target>
