When the wind's done died and the water casks are dry, it's &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;odd&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; one day, &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;overboard&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; the next.</target>

The dusker's been my luck since I was a boy. Survived more'n two weeks once on three bats I caught, trapped at the top of an abandoned watchtower. Even ate a wing off one afore I made up my mind to climb down the wall.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBSEA154_01145_AHLDFOET_000_014&lt;tab&gt;This journey, we'll be sailing past the Isles of Umbra and I can feel the sea honing those reefs. The lights at Pharos Sirius burn dim since the Calamity, and I've always found it a mite too much like that old watchtower for comfort.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBSEA154_01145_AHLDFOET_000_015&lt;tab&gt;I ain't been that affrighted boy for a long time─ill-used, starved, and more'n half-mad, inching down that sandstone wall on handholds no bigger than a fingertip. But I'll have me five bat wings on every journey, just the same as that boy had.</target>
