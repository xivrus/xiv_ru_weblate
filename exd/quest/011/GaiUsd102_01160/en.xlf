        <target state="final">TEXT_GAIUSD102_01160_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;After laying Eorzea to waste in the catastrophic event now known as the Calamity, Bahamut was sealed deep beneath the Carteneau Flats seemingly by Louisoix, who was presumed dead. Even in his imprisoned slumber, however, the primal continues to drink of the land's aether, and in time will awaken to cast his dark shadow over Eorzea once more. In order to prevent a repeat of the Calamity─and to be reunited with her grandfather─Alisaie declares that she will investigate the two other enormous fragments of Dalamud that fell to earth. Aid her in this endeavor, that the realm might know true peace.</target>
