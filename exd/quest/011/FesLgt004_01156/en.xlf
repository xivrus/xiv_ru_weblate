You return to Gridania and hand the parcel to Kipih Jakkya, at which point Lightning once more appears at your side. The lady&lt;var 1F /var&gt;knight speaks of her desire to remain in Eorzea, but your bravery has rekindled her own sense of determination. Drawn away by inexorable forces, Lightning returns to a world besieged by chaos and destruction. In whatever distant land she calls home, you are certain that her struggles continue.</target>
