After giving your account of events to an enthralled Dural Tharal, the reporter eagerly suggests opening the strange package. Inside, he discovers an unusual garment that he graciously returns to your possession. If the gossip Dural Tharal describes is any indication, Lightning's appearances seem to have become the favored subject of every rumormonger and tale-teller in Eorzea.</target>
