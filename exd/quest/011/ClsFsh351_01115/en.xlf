Unaware how a fisher might pull anything from sand, Sisipu recommends that you seek out U'goromuli, a dunefishing acquaintance of Tocktix's and a resident of Forgotten Springs in southern Thanalan.</target>

She advises you to seek out a fishing hole east of Byregot's Strike, near an Amalj'aa encampment, and use sand leeches to catch your quarry. Once acquired, deliver the fish to Tocktix outside the Fishermen's Guild.</target>
