Apparently, a woman matching F'lhaminn's description visited Byrglaent's winery very recently, but, finding her perfume to be intolerable, he expelled her from the premises. Though he has no inkling as to where she went next, the Wine Baron suggests that you solicit the aid of Shamani Lohmani, reasoning that his unique talents may enable him to track the perfumed lady.</target>
