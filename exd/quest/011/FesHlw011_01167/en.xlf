        <target state="final">TEXT_FESHLW011_01167_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Harvest season has come to Eorzea, and with it the annual observance of All Saints' Wake. This year, a traveling circus troupe has been summoned to Limsa Lominsa with the aim of reviving the revelrous traditions that have fallen out of favor since the Calamity. The shifty thespian invites you to speak with the Impresario─the leader of the troupe─to obtain a costume, that you too might join in the celebration.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
