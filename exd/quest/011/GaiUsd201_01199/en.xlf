Unfortunately, such flawless specimens are most likely to be found in the midst of the various beast tribe strongholds, and will not be had without a fight.

Alas, there is another step which must be completed ere we come to that. While the crystals you acquired are indeed flawless, they are of little use to us in their present form. If they are to reflect the elemental forces of the tower's defenses, they must needs be cut and polished.</target>
