        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBSCH451_01101_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Much of what Alka Zolka has learned of scholars pertains to their roles in the Nymian military. However, his most recent translations offer insight into their activities during times of peace. Apparently, scholars would use their talents to help the sick and infirm, and they were even instrumental in combating a virulent plague which once threatened to engulf all of Nym. For these reasons, Alka Zolka believes that tending to the patients recuperating at Camp Bronze Lake might rekindle the memories of your faerie. Journey to the Warmwine Sanitorium in upper La Noscea and offer your services to Rukusa Farusa.</target>
