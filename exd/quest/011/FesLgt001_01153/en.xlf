				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_FESLGT001_01153_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;During your efforts to whittle down the rising numbers of monstrous wildlife, you encounter an enigmatic knight who introduces herself as “Lightning.” After retrieving an odd parcel she left behind after the battle, you return to Limsa Lominsa to share your experiences with Petyr Winsome. At the reporter's insistence, you both tear open the strange parcel to reveal gloves of highly unusual design. Petyr, more than pleased with your contribution to his article, gladly places the handwear into your keeping. You are left wondering, however, who Lightning truly is, and whence the warrior has come.</target>

Should you encounter any of these creatures, I would greatly appreciate aught you might share with me!
...And though I doubt not your integrity, would you mind returning with some physical evidence of your efforts? I have a reputation as a seeker of truth to maintain, you understand!</target>
