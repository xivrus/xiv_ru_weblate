There is a tale that brings the rough Roegadyn soldier to his knees thus, one you may learn yet by speaking to him.</target>

Under the stone, a settler named Aerghaemr who breathed his last not on his farm, but holding a trail against the Sahagin as his comrades made their escape. Such is the man that this sergeant and former corsair has chosen as his lodestar.</target>

You go fetch Roehanth, I'd be liable to profane the lichyard by beating him about his thick head with that big stone hourglass.</target>

No pirate cap'n's going down with her ship and any cap'n who looks to loyalty more than gold is liable to have his throat slit.
But now, I got to be better than that, don't I? I got to be more like Aerghaemr.</target>
