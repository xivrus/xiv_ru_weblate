To that end, she bids you seek Lightning out in the Coerthas central highlands, where the knight was last seen headed. Should you encounter the enigmatic figure, the reporter would like to hear of your experiences, as well as examine any evidence of her passing you might acquire.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

After besting the gargantuan construct, she once again leaves behind an otherworldly parcel, which you bring back on your return to Gridania. After handing the parcel over to Kipih Jakkya, you are suddenly approached by Lightning herself. Though it appears the warrior has been sent to Eorzea against her will, she nevertheless expresses a growing fondness for the realm's vibrant beauty. Kipih Jakkya believes the parcel Lightning left behind is actually a gift meant for you─a sign of the lady&lt;var 1F /var&gt;knight's gratitude for your timely assistance. Could this be the last you will see of the mysterious visitor?</target>
