As Varshahn believes the Ilsabard contingent will oblige your request, he proposes that you attend to the aether problem first. Thus do you make your way to the airship landing and the journey ahead.</target>

Alas, access to the isle is restricted, and you must first petition the Forum to grant you leave to travel there. This is, of course, not the first time you have needed to navigate Sharlayan bureaucracy, and so you soon find yourself crossing the familiar threshold of the Baldesion Annex in search of your old friend Krile.</target>

After hearing the details of your plan, Krile pledges the support of the Students of Baldesion, and Erenville offers the name of a researcher who likely knows how aether was intended to be stored and transferred to the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Ragnarok&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. So buoyed by the support of your friends, you bid them farewell and head to Sharlayan Hamlet in search of the researcher named Margrat.</target>

After a quick chat, he agrees to lend you the aether tanks without hesitation, though he laments that he can do nothing to grease the wheels of the Forum, which ever turn slowly. As is his wont, however, he elects to describe said tendencies in a rather more inelegant fashion, only to be corrected by a stone-faced Fourchenault, who arrives in the company of Krile and Scholarch Montichaigne. The Forum has passed a favorable verdict, states Fourchenault, on the sole condition that you slay whatever fearsome beasts you encounter during your expedition to the Isle of Haam. Your transportation to the island has also been arranged; the vessel awaits you in Scholar's Harbor.</target>
