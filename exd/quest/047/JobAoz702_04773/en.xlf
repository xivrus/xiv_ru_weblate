Martyn has been tasked with finding this challenger, and to be certain they are a worthy rival, they must prove to be stronger than even himself. It is a laborious task that will take considerable time, which is why the blue mage suggests you continue your training in preparation. Until news of a potential candidate reaches P'yandih at the guild, he suggests mastering the spell Goblin Punch.</target>
