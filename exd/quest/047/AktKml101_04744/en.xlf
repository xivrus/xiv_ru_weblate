If you are to thwart his ambitions, you must find a means to convey Light from the First unto the Thirteenth, that you might defeat his champion Zeromus. To that end, Y'shtola consulted with Cid and the Ironworks, who then proceeded to produce bespoke devices for the occasion: aether transmitters. The task of delivering these transmitters to the First naturally falls to you alone─until Zero expresses her desire to accompany you on the journey. This requires that her soul be placed in a spirit vessel, and so while Y'shtola sees to the transference, you attend to your own preparations before joining the others at Meghaduta.</target>
