Though he doesn't seem in a particularly talkative mood, he does offer a valuable piece of information. A man named Octobeard claims to be the right hand of Mistbeard, and has been seen frequenting the Drowning Wench. Considering Mistbeard's renown, you are convinced any man worthy to work at his side is more than capable of being your nemesis. And so you make for the tavern.</target>

He promises never to do it again and begs his leave before running off, tail between his legs. With no other leads, Martyn believes it time to set his sights elsewhere.
