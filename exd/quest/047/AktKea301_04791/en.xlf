Before engaging them further, it is decided that you will seek out the watcher on the moon, who is believed to be the thirteenth unnamed being mentioned by the monument, in order to learn more about their objective. With your course decided, you promptly set off for the Watcher's Palace in Mare Lamentorum.</target>

And though he is unable to disclose the truth of their desire, he gives his guarantee that it will not visit harm upon mankind. Thus reassured, you and your companions decide to return to the Omphalos to continue engaging the gods.</target>

The Wanderer promises that the truth will be revealed in the innermost part of their realm, before he and his brethren take their leave in anticipation of your coming.</target>
