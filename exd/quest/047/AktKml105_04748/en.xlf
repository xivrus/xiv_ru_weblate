Though the stakes are high, he vows to keep his emotions in check and let nothing sway him from his chosen course─and by the set of his jaw, you do not doubt that he will be true to his word.

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKML105_04748_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;As you advance through the red moon's subterranean maze, you happen upon a memoria crystal. No sooner does it begin to glow than you find yourself reliving a memory of bygone days, in which a man named Durante fights to protect king and country alongside his companion Golbez. The pair are in pursuit of a dark memoriate, whom they finally confront in the heart of a castle. The malign warrior appears defeated, but with his final breath corrupts Golbez with the power of a dark memoria crystal, leaving Durante with no choice but to lay his friend low and seal him in memoria. Though heartbroken, he is not deterred from his mission, and proclaims that Golbez will live on as the hero who saves the world.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKML105_04748_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The memory has laid bare the shocking truth: the man you believed to be Golbez is in fact his companion Durante. The impostor emerges from the shadows to stand before you, and Zero urges him to abandon his desperate cause, but the man who was Durante remains adamant that terrible might wielded for tremendous change is the only answer. He reveals that, in his bid to end the Contramemoria, it was none other than he who unleashed the Flood of Darkness and doomed the Thirteenth. Having reaffirmed his purpose and his name, Golbez then takes his leave to ensure that nothing interferes with Zeromus's awakening.

Your foe conjures shades of his fallen archfiends, together with whom he attempts to bar the path to Zeromus, but your comrades manage to occupy them long enough to afford you an opening to slip past. So it is that you arrive in the nexus where the dread voidsent slumbers. It stirs to life in your presence, and it falls to you to prevent it from destroying the barrier between worlds.
