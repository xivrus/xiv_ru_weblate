No sooner does it begin to glow than you find yourself reliving a memory of bygone days, in which a man named Durante fights to protect king and country alongside his companion Golbez. The pair are in pursuit of a dark memoriate, whom they finally confront in the heart of a castle. The malign warrior appears defeated, but with his final breath corrupts Golbez with the power of a dark memoria crystal, leaving Durante with no choice but to lay his friend low and seal him in memoria. Though heartbroken, he is not deterred from his mission, and proclaims that Golbez will live on as the hero who saves the world.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKML105_04748_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The memory has laid bare the shocking truth: the man you believed to be Golbez is in fact his companion Durante. The impostor emerges from the shadows to stand before you, and Zero urges him to abandon his desperate cause, but the man who was Durante remains adamant that terrible might wielded for tremendous change is the only answer. He reveals that, in his bid to end the Contramemoria, it was none other than he who unleashed the Flood of Darkness and doomed the Thirteenth. Having reaffirmed his purpose and his name, Golbez then takes his leave to ensure that nothing interferes with Zeromus's awakening.
