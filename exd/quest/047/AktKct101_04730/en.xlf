Hearing this, you are not terribly surprised to discover that the artisan who arrives soon after is the same Grenoldt you encountered in the depths of the Tempest. Grenoldt has judged that the time is right for him to rejoin society, and invites you to come along as he seeks to pair his veteran experience with the untapped potential of a new generation of craftspeople─namely, the promising Chora-Zoi.</target>
