Summoned to Eulmore to discuss the Boutique's next steps, you are greeted by crowds of skilled artisans...as well as a rogue ironfrog mover belonging to Qeshi-Trao, a trusted associate of Mowen's. During your dealings, Mowen gleefully approves another round of enhancements, and nominates Chora-Zoi as the tools' new namesake. Mowen is well aware of the young smith's apprehension, however, and requests a word with you before the next phase of the project begins in earnest.</target>

Her main matter of business completed, Mowen mentions that the two skilled smiths in question have returned to the Crystarium, and suggests that you follow suit.</target>
