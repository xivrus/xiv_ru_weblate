The researcher instructs you to make your way to the Aetherial Lens, where Fourchenault awaits.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKRA301_04756_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Fourchenault informs you that an investigation of Azys Lla recovered Claudien's airship, but found no trace of the missing professor. Furthermore, reports indicate that part of Azys Lla is no longer there─to all appearances having been removed from the facility in its entirety. Fourchenault and his peers believe that this missing portion was somehow reformed into Pandæmonium, which now floats forebodingly on the currents of the aetherial sea. Ere you can brave its halls in search of the truth, however, you will need to dispatch an aether-hungry beast that has emerged from its gates. Equipped with the memory crystal that once so fascinated Claudien, you step forth to confront the ravening monstrosity.

While she claims no ill intent, she confesses to kidnapping Claudien for use in her research, which she seems convinced will allow her to ascend to godhood. She would have you join her experiment, going so far as to create apparitions from crystallized memories and spare souls that can teach you of her ambitions. She then retreats to Pandæmonium, leaving you with the bewildered simulacra of Lahabrea and Erichthonios.</target>
