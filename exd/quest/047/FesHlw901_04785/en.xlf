All Saints' Wake is once again come to Gridania, and the Adventurers' Guild has sent a lone investigator to ensure that ghastly ghouls do not overrun the city as in ages past. While all appears civil for now, the investigator is certain that the pumpkin-headed apparition is brewing a devious plot and recruits you to approach her under the guise of cooperation. After winning her confidence, you are to put an end to any schemes you uncover.

She seems unperturbed, however, and assures you that she works to make this year's festivities thrilling, but not horrifying. To this end, she asks you to aid Papa Gruff, a voidsent-turned-clown who is apparently having trouble providing the townspeople with merry thrills. He can be found near the Leatherworkers' Guild─that is, if an angry mob has yet to chase him off.</target>
