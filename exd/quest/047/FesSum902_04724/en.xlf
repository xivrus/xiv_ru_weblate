The chaperone is keen on this idea, and instructs him to keep watch over the revelers on the northeastern shores of Costa del Sol. Your task is to help the youth spot any signs of trouble, and offer advice on how best to keep the peace.

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESSUM902_04724_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Haermaga is pleased with Lyonell's progress, and explains that his costume is modeled after the Phoenix of legend. Just like that legendary bird, the chaperone hopes that Lyonell can be reborn, and thus recover his lost confidence. This hope is soon tested when an enormous shark emerges from the ocean depths, and Lyonell is forced to drive it back in an impressive display of bravery. After the fight, Lyonell stands dumbfounded at his own actions, and you somehow get the feeling he may require one final nudge in the right direction.</target>
