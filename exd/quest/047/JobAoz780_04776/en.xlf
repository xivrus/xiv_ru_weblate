Regular spectators at the Last Vigil have doubtless seen enough tournament bouts to suggest a fighter worthy to be your nemesis. He bids you go ahead and wait for him there while he finishes his duties at the stable.</target>

The revelation vexes him, because it would mean conceding defeat in full view of you, his dear protégé. The matter is compounded when the tournament attendant tells you both that the school of blue magic is strictly forbidden. But Martyn has come too far to back down, and so he steels himself as he enters the arena.

As one might expect, Ser Alaimbert is relentless, and without use of blue magic, Martyn quickly finds himself on the back foot. The situation seems dire as Ser Alaimbert readies to deal a finishing blow, but in a last-ditch effort to protect his pride, Martyn unleashes a series of devastating spells to seal a narrow victory.</target>

It was a bittersweet victory, however, because it proved that Ser Alaimbert was sadly unfit to be your nemesis. Or so it would seem. Now realizing Martyn is capable of wielding more than blue magic, she insists that he become the rival you have been searching for. He is understandably confused, but before he can form a convincing argument to refuse, she ushers you all back to Ul'dah to begin preparations.</target>
