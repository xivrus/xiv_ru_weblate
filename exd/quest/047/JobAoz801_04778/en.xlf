        <target state="final">TEXT_JOBAOZ801_04778_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Thanks to your near-peerless prowess as a blue mage, Martyn received a sound thrashing in the Celestium, and not an empty seat could be found in the stands. There was still the matter of Martyn's pay to resolve, but that also proved a defeat for the budding villain, even if he was not entirely aware of it. While willing to make an exception for you, Martyn has no intention of losing to any other blue mage who might issue him challenge, and so resolves to hone his skills in other schools of magic.</target>
