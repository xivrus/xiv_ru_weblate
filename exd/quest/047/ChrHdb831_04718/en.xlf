The Case of the Silent Correspondent continues! After a traditionally dynamic reunion with Father, and the disintegration of my remaining dashing clones, I, Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville, have returned from the moon to embark on a search for Master PuPu's uncommunicative comrade. With stout heart and stalwart associates, there is not a mote of doubt in my Mandervillian mind that we shall be successful in this endeavor.

Both pleased by and suspicious of your timely arrival, Delion reiterates his desire to expose PuPu's presumably well-disguised plans for invasion. Inspector Hildibrand's keen inspector's sense has, it seems, led him to Palaka's Stand, which gives Delion─and you─the perfect chance to continue tracking the little blue man's movements.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2" approved="yes"><source>2</source><target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB831_04718_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Regrettably, instinct alone has failed to provide a more precise location for PuPu's missing friend.

Fortuitously, reinforcements appear in the form of Godbert, who is more than happy to join his son in his latest escapade. Hildibrand assigns teams and directions, pairing you with PuPu and charging you with scouring the jungle's western reaches.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="5" approved="yes"><source>5</source><target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB831_04718_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;With a solid lead on his friend's whereabouts at last, PuPu is eager to follow you into the jungle.

It is then that you receive a call from Nashu, who may have spotted PuPu's friend near Purusa. You rush over with all haste, only to find that the figure in question was a mandragora. Several mandragoras, in fact. Actually, an entire gang of infamous seedkin, known literally as the Mandragoras. Accompanied by a zombie gentleman (to Delion's shock and delight), the villainous vegetables came to Thavnair in search of their own friend─an individual who, it transpires, was mistakenly abducted by PuPu. The contrite mandragora-napper releases his “sample,” and the reunited Mandragoras take their leave.

In the wake of the mandragora misunderstanding, Delion muses aloud on the limitations of Hildibrand's “keen” inspector's sense. PuPu takes the editor's idle wish for a Hildibrand army to heart, and fires up his matter duplication facility. The defective machine ultimately breaks down, but not before producing one singularly blocky replication of Inspector Hildibrand. Encouraged by his new clone's dissimilar appearance, an enthusiastic Hildibrand recruits “Brandihild” to aid in the investigation.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="9" approved="yes"><source>9</source><target state="final">TEXT_CHRHDB831_04718_SEQ_09&lt;tab&gt;As the dust settles and the chaos dies down, you find your already eclectic party joined by a “charming new contemporary.” Brandihild is eager to be a part of it all─or so he says.
