The pair inform you that they have begun a tour of Eorzea at Lyse's suggestion, to behold all it has to offer now that some semblance of peace has settled throughout the realm. As they have come all this way, Tataru suggests that you show the pair around the island, to which you agree with a characteristic nod. After an extensive examination of the local sheep, they seem well satisfied, and offer you a souvenir from the Azim Steppe─traditional garments adjusted for warm climes. With the island once more to yourself, you may focus wholeheartedly on its continued development.</target>
