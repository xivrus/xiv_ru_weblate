At the last, he found that he could not bear to be parted from his newfound friends, and chose to remain. Henceforth, he means to travel the world with a renewed perspective, but ere he sets out, he wishes to move his brethren's hopes, harbored in the Omphalos monument, to a place in men's midst. It is decided that everyone will accompany Deryk on this task, and you set off for the Sanctum of the Twelve in the East Shroud.</target>
