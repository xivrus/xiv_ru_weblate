That business being settled, the emotional state of Valens's former wards─the boys from earlier─weighs heavily upon Gaius's mind, and he would have you speak with them to allay their lingering unease.</target>

With their minds now truly at ease, their thoughts turn to Allie, who has been taking care of them at the orphanage. As a show of their appreciation to her, they hope to see Allie's dream realized by hiring an artist to render a portrait of her together with her sole remaining family member─her father. While they set about finding a portraitist, you agree to speak with Gaius and Allie to tell them of this undertaking.</target>

Yet she would not reject the children's kindness out of hand, and so she agrees to meet everyone at the lookout.</target>

Avilina assures them that it is, before revealing a synthetic auracite device. Upon activating it, the contraption emits projections of Milisandia, Ricon, Rex, and Alfonse beside Gaius and Allie, who are taken aback by the unexpected but welcome sight of these visions. Allie's joy is clear for all to see, as a rare smile plays across her lips.</target>
