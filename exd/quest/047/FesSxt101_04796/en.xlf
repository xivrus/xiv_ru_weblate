The itinerant tale-teller shares with you a dream he had─supposedly prophetic in nature─which seems to foretell your meeting with a metaphorical “scarlet star” in some fiery landscape. Deeming the Burning Wall the closest match to this vision, he bids you accompany him to eastern Thanalan, where he hopes to witness the denouement to his celestial vision.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>
