Appearing as if from nowhere, the wandering minstrel proposes that this disconnect stems from the fact that Clive himself is not of this world─a conclusion reached after an extensive survey of the surrounding settlements turned up not even a single soul who had met their distinctively tattooed visitor before. Furthermore, the Elder Seedseer concludes that Clive's amnesia is not the result of illness or injury. Rather, she speculates he is suppressing some awful truth─one he must confront by breaking through a barrier of his own making.</target>
