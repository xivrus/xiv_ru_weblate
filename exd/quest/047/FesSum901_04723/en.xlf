Mayaru Moyaru informs you that in addition to the acclaimed Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, the festivities are being guarded by a brave hero called the Sunshine Savior. However, there are always more hands needed at Costa del Sol, and he encourages you to report to Haermaga if the spirit of volunteering stirs within you.

He asks for your help in solving a pressing issue with the fledgling Sunshine Savior. The chaperone explains that a young man named Lyonell was recruited for the role, but his spirits took a turn for the worse after he arrived in Costa del Sol. Haermaga seems to think a bit of guidance will bolster his confidence, and you agree to offer what aid you can. The young man is standing by near the aetheryte, and Haermaga asks you to follow him there to make introductions.</target>
