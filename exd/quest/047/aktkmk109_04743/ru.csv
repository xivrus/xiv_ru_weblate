Vrtra is a prisoner of his melancholy, until Zero of all people gives him and the others reason to cling to hope. In recalling the fate of Farfarello, the cowardly voidsent who was devoured by his comrade Ciriatto, she explains that when a voidsent dies, the souls it once harbored may break free and become individual entities once more. And so, when the time comes to lay low Zeromus, she urges Vrtra to call out to his sister, that she may find the strength to endure and be restored to life. Y'shtola further bolsters the spirits of all present when she announces her plan to harness the First's resplendent Light to counter Zeromus's impenetrable Darkness. This undertaking will require much time and preparation, and in the interim Estinien and Zero resolve to devote their energies to training for the battles that await.","","","False","0x00000003","",""
