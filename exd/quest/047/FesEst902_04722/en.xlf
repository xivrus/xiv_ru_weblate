        <target state="final">TEXT_FESEST902_04722_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;It turns out that Hamlyn's master plan to restore peace to the plundered caravan is strikingly similar─if not utterly identical─to the plan you carried out not moments ago. If it will solve your sylph dilemma long enough to get your hands on some glorious eggs, however, you're willing to give it the old Archon try. You head to the Central Shroud and prepare to combat the sylphs' jealous mood with some green of your own.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.
※The FATE “Don't Be Sylphish” can only be completed as a Disciple of War or Magic.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_FESEST902_04722_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;After a frantic scuffle involving sylphs, a giant mammet, and more shuffling than is comfortable for the average tonberry, you manage to recover the scattered Archon eggs. Panting from exertion and pleased to be free of your sweaty guise (once more pawed off you by an overzealous Hamlyn), you trek back to Gridania to give Jihli the good news.</target>

As it turns out, enough townsfolk were present to warrant extending personal thanks for returning their precious eggs─which they ought to decorate &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;as&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; tonberries to prevent any further sylph shenanigans, Hamlyn helpfully suggests. While Hamlyn could not be less subtle in his tonberry touting, you can't deny the modicum of truth in his suggestion, and really, you'd just like to get on with it already.
