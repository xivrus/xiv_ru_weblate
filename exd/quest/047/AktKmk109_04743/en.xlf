Be that as it may, since the brands were repaired in haste, and the true potential of dragon-become-voidsent is unclear, there is no telling how long you can afford to rely on this last line of defense. For now, Urianger vows to maintain his vigil over the seal with the Loporrits and the watcher, while you work alongside your allies in Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han to devise a plan to combat this unprecedented threat.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMK109_04743_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;The mood in Meghaduta is as grim as it was in the void, with the failure to save Azdaja still painfully fresh. Vrtra is a prisoner of his melancholy, until Zero of all people gives him and the others reason to cling to hope. In recalling the fate of Farfarello, the cowardly voidsent who was devoured by his comrade Ciriatto, she explains that when a voidsent dies, the souls it once harbored may break free and become individual entities once more. And so, when the time comes to lay low Zeromus, she urges Vrtra to call out to his sister, that she may find the strength to endure and be restored to life. Y'shtola further bolsters the spirits of all present when she announces her plan to harness the First's resplendent Light to counter Zeromus's impenetrable Darkness. This undertaking will require much time and preparation, and in the interim Estinien and Zero resolve to devote their energies to training for the battles that await.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="4" approved="yes"><source>4</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKMK109_04743_SEQ_04&lt;tab&gt;Heartened by Zero's words, Varshahn reaffirms his desire to save his sister, and asks that you continue to lend him your strength until the great wyrm is finally free.
