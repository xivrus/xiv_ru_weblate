He then reveals that a mammet hunt has been arranged for the guests, and that the reporter to find the most wind-up Godberts will be granted an exclusive interview with the Gold Saucer's owner. To even the odds, the other two reporters team up, and quickly set off into the din of their surroundings. Eager to win this once-in-a-career opportunity, Kipih Jakkya wishes to discuss strategy sooner rather than later.</target>
