In order to collect letters from outside of Ul'dah, the man has dispatched a chocobo carriage with Nhagi'a as an escort. However, the carriage is late to return, and the minstrel apologetically asks you to conduct a search. Having thus found a likely lead, you bear the news to Kipih, who awaits you near the Quicksand.</target>

Wasting no time, you and Kipih rush to the scene and scare the highwaymen away before they can overwhelm Nhagi'a. Thus are the siblings reunited─although Nhagi'a's utterance that he needs to grow stronger to gain Kipih's approval appears to give her pause. Nhagi'a then continues on to Ul'dah with the carriage to complete his delivery, and you and Kipih likewise head back to join the wandering minstrel at the Gold Court.</target>

His obsession with doing everything alone does not sit well with Kipih, who declares that she can't consent to his being an adventurer any longer. If he wishes to remain one, he must win her over─and it begins with pondering why he first embarked upon this path. Though saddened, Nhagi'a agrees to think on the matter and goes off, leaving you with the minstrel and a grim-faced Kipih.</target>
