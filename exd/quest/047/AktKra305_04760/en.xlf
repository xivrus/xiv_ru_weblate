				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKRA305_04760_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;While waiting for Claudien to regain his senses, Lahabrea asks you about the Ascian that shared his name, confessing that he sees the Paragon's actions as a logical evolution of his own devotion to duty. Knowing now what is to come, he soundly rejects the now-awakened professor's attempts to express gratitude, though this may be out of principle rather than contrition. Regardless, having fulfilled his role to the last, Lahabrea fades into the aetherial sea once more, leaving you with the tantalizing suggestion that should you return to the past, Pandæmonium's final mysteries might be solved.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKRA305_04760_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;While Erichthonios and Themis greet you warmly in Pandæmonium, Lahabrea reacts with characteristic curtness. Apparently, he was just on his way to settle some matters of grave import, so you follow him to an empty chamber where Hegemone awaits. Lahabrea accuses her of setting Hephaistos free, surmising that she has been under the influence of Athena's mind-controlling magicks for some time. With this truth come to light, Lahabrea's decision is made: in order to gain the strength required to break Athena's hold, he will rejoin Hephaistos's essence to his own. After absorbing those bitter memories, the change in his personality is immediately apparent─in him you see the Lahabrea who will one day stand against you as an enemy, and he seems well aware that your respective wills must one day clash. While far from an ideal farewell, the questions that led you back to the past are answered.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKRA305_04760_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;You return to the present-day's aetherial sea, where Claudien informs you that a new memory has surfaced within the crystal. It shows you a vision of Erichthonios, apparently from the Final Days, wherein he resolves to set the crystal adrift as a warning to survivors about the nature of Pandæmonium. Ere you have time to reflect on your comrade's fate, however, Claudien reveals that the Heart of Sabik has come into his possession, now empty of Athena's memories. As it remains a powerful specimen, Claudien seems keen to devote his coming days to exploring its secrets. Though this is perhaps not the wisest idea, you have more pressing matters to attend to for the moment─namely, one last farewell.</target>

From what he can make out, he speculates that he agreed to send you to Elpis because of vague recollections of your time together in Pandæmonium, though given the great change wrought upon his personality by the intervening millennia, it is impossible to be certain. Reflecting with fondness upon your time together and the meaning it may hold, he dissipates into the aetherial sea, leaving you to contemplate the vast expanse.</target>
