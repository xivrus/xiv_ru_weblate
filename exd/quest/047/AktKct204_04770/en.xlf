				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;With a proud gleam in his eyes, Grenoldt reaffirms his gratitude for your myriad contributions to Chora-Zoi's works. He insists that words of thanks alone will not suffice, however, and offers to throw a commemorative feast at the Wandering Stairs for you and Chora-Zoi. Joined by Mowen and Quinnana, you savor this rare moment of respite, and watch with great interest as Grenoldt─unintentionally emboldened by a vintage he mistook for purple carrot juice─attempts to put his long-hidden feelings for Mowen into words before collapsing on the floor. With your efforts combined, the remaining four of you drag the legendary smith back to the Crystalline Mean, where you wait for him to come to his senses.</target>

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">TEXT_AKTKCT204_04770_SEQ_02&lt;tab&gt;Grenoldt's countenance sinks when he learns that Mowen has departed for Eulmore, and claims to have no memory of the feast. He regales you with a similarly shameful tale from his past of dizzying drinks, and though his regret is palpable, he is eager to return to the subject of Chora-Zoi's tools. Both master and apprentice are compelled to answer the call of perfection one last time in the name of the trades, and you cannot help but wonder─what could possibly lie in store beyond such brilliance?</target>
