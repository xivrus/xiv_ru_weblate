        <target state="final">TEXT_FESXMS901_04781_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;The bearded volunteer who greets you is Amh Garanjy, Starlight celebrant and expert of all things both wintery and cheerful. This year, the Starlight festivities are honoring the Saint of Nymeia with special recreations of his classic garments─most prominently, his glorious red coat and great, big, bushy beard. Such a visage is sure to bring delight to any youngling, but it seems there is at least one lad who cannot agree, as he stares longingly at the festive merriment before fleeing to locations unknown. Saulinne, a young lady worried for his happiness, petitions your assistance, which you happily provide by questioning Gridania's residents for further details on this mysterious moper.

※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.</target>

You determine that the most realistic solution to his problem is mailing gifts to said friends─a decision enthusiastically supported by a particularly iconic Saint of Nymeia who boasts superior crafting skills and flawless facial hair. Saulinne pledges her assistance as well, and so it is that you are enlisted as the official courier for Tenny's gifts. Your first task is delivering an update to Amh Garanjy whilst the Saint of Nymeia instructs the eager younglings in the art of handicrafts.</target>
