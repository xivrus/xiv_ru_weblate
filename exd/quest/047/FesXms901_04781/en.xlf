This year, the Starlight festivities are honoring the Saint of Nymeia with special recreations of his classic garments─most prominently, his glorious red coat and great, big, bushy beard. Such a visage is sure to bring delight to any youngling, but it seems there is at least one lad who cannot agree, as he stares longingly at the festive merriment before fleeing to locations unknown. Saulinne, a young lady worried for his happiness, petitions your assistance, which you happily provide by questioning Gridania's residents for further details on this mysterious moper.
