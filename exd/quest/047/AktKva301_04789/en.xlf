Kalika, as he names himself, hails from an isle to the south known as Aloalo, which has long been a verdant paradise home to many animals and men both. However, in the wake of the inhabitants' abrupt departure a century ago, the animals have been free to eat and breed unchecked, and now hordes of ravenous beasts threaten to destroy the balance of nature. Thus did Kalika brave the ocean waves to seek a hunter brave and true─a hero he proclaims to be none other than Matsya. Matsya, unsurprisingly, begs to differ, and entreats you to accompany him on an expedition to Aloalo. You agree, and so Pasasun goes to charter a boat that will deliver you to the island, and bids you meet him in Yedlihmad once you are ready to depart.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="3" approved="yes"><source>3</source><target state="final">TEXT_AKTKVA301_04789_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Pasasun informs you that a trio of bandits stole a ship from the Yedlihmad docks shortly before your arrival.

Regardless, you must turn your attention to Aloalo and the coming journey with your fisherman-turned-hero companion.
