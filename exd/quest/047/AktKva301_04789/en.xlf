The alchemist Pasasun, writing on behalf of the fisherman Matsya, has asked for help in extricating his friend from a spot of unspecified trouble. Shallow Moor informs you that the alchemist can likely be found at the Great Work, if and when you decide to answer his call to action.</target>

Kalika, as he names himself, hails from an isle to the south known as Aloalo, which has long been a verdant paradise home to many animals and men both. However, in the wake of the inhabitants' abrupt departure a century ago, the animals have been free to eat and breed unchecked, and now hordes of ravenous beasts threaten to destroy the balance of nature. Thus did Kalika brave the ocean waves to seek a hunter brave and true─a hero he proclaims to be none other than Matsya. Matsya, unsurprisingly, begs to differ, and entreats you to accompany him on an expedition to Aloalo. You agree, and so Pasasun goes to charter a boat that will deliver you to the island, and bids you meet him in Yedlihmad once you are ready to depart.</target>

        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKVA301_04789_SEQ_03&lt;tab&gt;Pasasun informs you that a trio of bandits stole a ship from the Yedlihmad docks shortly before your arrival. While it was not the vessel the alchemist commissioned─and thus its loss shall not hinder your plans─the timing of the theft is curious indeed. Regardless, you must turn your attention to Aloalo and the coming journey with your fisherman-turned-hero companion.

※Aloalo Island can be accessed via the V&amp;C Dungeon Finder.

The Speaker's servant implores you both to visit the isle many times more─and indeed, the unexplored remainder and resilient fauna ensure that Pasasun will be busy taking notes for many days to come. But before you embark upon your next expedition, it is only prudent that you report your success to Shallow Moor.</target>
