Once more did I set aside the Case of the Silent Correspondent to divert my inspectorial energies to more urgent matters─namely, the restoration of the ailing Master PuPu back to health. Laid low by a common cold, his unearthly physiology called for uncommon treatment, yet I, Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville, did not shy from the challenge! Our extraterrestrial comrade thus restored (and an ambush by the incorrigible villain Doctor Lugae soundly thwarted), I resolved to resume the investigation in the scholarly city of Sharlayan. There did we learn a most heartening thing: Master PuPu's comrade was alive and well, and in the company of a Hannish alchemist. Such news was almost overshadowed, however, by the stunning secret revealed by Father's sought-after relic: the progenitor of the Manderville line was, himself, a being of alien origin! Will this change how I, a gentlemanly agent of enquiry, approach my investigations? Decidedly not!
　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*
Determined to implicate the friendly PuPu in the world-spanning conspiracy he is certain, beyond a shadow of a doubt, most definitely exists, Delion would have you join him on a fact-finding expedition to Yedlihmad. It is there that Inspector Hildibrand and the others are continuing the investigation, their search now redirected to the Hannish alchemist thought to be accompanying PuPu's long-lost comrade.</target>

Surely someone among the port's populace knows the adventurous apothecary who risked all to peddle potions in the midst of Garlemald's civil war.</target>

After learning the alchemist's surprising identity, however, you are suddenly called to a disturbance on the outskirts of Yedlihmad where you encounter a strangely oblivious Doctor Lugae. Somehow, he is back in possession of his hulking body, and claims to be under Vanhudi's orders to cause trouble at the port. Godbert and Julyan appear during the ensuing battle, and assist you in defeating several more identical Lugaes who join the fray. PuPu then dematerializes the fallen brutes with his starship's vaporization beam, thereby proving that they were the result of matter replication technology.

It seems evident now that Vanhudi has been using the vessel belonging to PuPu's friend to amass a fortune of duplicated gold. You are unsure if the long-lost alien is being deceived or coerced into helping the unscrupulous merchant, but Hildibrand is determined to mount a rescue either way...</target>
