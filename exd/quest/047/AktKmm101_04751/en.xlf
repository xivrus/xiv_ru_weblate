The gleaner has returned from his expedition abroad rather earlier than expected, and the change in his plans is likely related to a visitor he wishes for you to meet. While awaiting your arrival, Erenville has gone to the Studium, and you decide to seek him out there.</target>

The gregarious woman wastes no time revealing her business: she wants you to accompany her to her homeland and help her triumph in the impending ritual of succession, a contest to determine the next ruler. As it is a rather abrupt request to make of someone she has only just met, she proposes going on a hunt together, the better to get acquainted.</target>
