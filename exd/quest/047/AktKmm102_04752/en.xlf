Some manner of predator has unsettled ordinarily docile animals, causing them to behave savagely, and the task involves identifying and dealing with the creature. Seeing an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, you all make your way to Scholar's Harbor to secure passage─with the exception of Krile, who promises to join you at the isle after she has seen to her preparations.</target>

With your work on the isle complete, you make your way back to Sharlayan, amply stocked with the meat of your worthy prey.</target>

It becomes clear that her chief aim in seeking the throne is to deny the ambitions of another claimant─a warmonger who aspires to lead Tural's armies on a campaign of conquest. Reiterating her desire for you to join her cause, she says that she will remain in Sharlayan for as long as she can while awaiting your decision.</target>
