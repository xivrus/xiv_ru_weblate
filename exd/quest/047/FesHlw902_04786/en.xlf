Claiming responsibility for the troubled botanist and lingering voidsent in the Greatloam Growery, he sends you off towards eastern Gridania, where he senses more voidsent lurk. Wand in hand, you sally forth to flush out the lingering spooks with your pumpkin-producing All Saints' Charm.

The clown is so taken with the flavor of gratitude that he becomes more committed than ever to spending this All Saints' Wake delivering shriek-accompanied smiles. Glowing with the satisfaction of her plan seen to fruition, the pumpkin-headed apparition asks you to relate all that has happened to the Adventurers' Guild investigator, in hopes he may direct his suspicious gaze elsewhere.</target>
