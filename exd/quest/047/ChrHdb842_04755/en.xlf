Delion is the notable exception, though it is unclear if his suffering is due to some intrinsic quality, or because the gods were feeling capricious. In any event, the editor in chief is determined to push through his nausea, proposing an immediate investigation of the Sharlayans' “underground military facility”─an idea onto which the inspector latches with characteristic enthusiasm. The Hall of Artifice awaits.</target>

It transpires that one was a Hannish apothecary who, upon giving up on his mercantile endeavors in war-torn Garlemald, came across a wrecked vessel and its unusual pilot stranded in the snow. The gleaner met said apothecary in Thavnair, the man having returned to his homeland with both broken craft and alien occupant in tow. Wishing to offer assistance with repairs, the gleaner then escorted them to Sharlayan─and Thaumazein's famed engineers. Once the vessel was restored, however, the pair departed and have not been seen since.

You remain one step behind, but for now it is enough to know that PuPu's friend is very much alive, and likely to be found in the company of the alchemist. With these clues in hand, your party elects to return to Radz&lt;var 1F /var&gt;at&lt;var 1F /var&gt;Han and continue the search.</target>

PuPu recognizes the recovered artifact as a device made by Mandervillians─a technologically advanced alien race─and offers to access and present to everyone whatever images may be stored within it. Thus do all gather in a darkened room to view the recording, where you are blindsided by the revelation that Godbrand, the founding lord of House Manderville, was the last surviving member of the starfaring Mandervillians. Manderville weaponry, too, appears to be the product of extraterrestrial innovation. While initially flabbergasted, Hildibrand and Godbert accept their cosmic roots without question, and vow to uphold their ancestor's heartfelt wishes to aid the people of this star. Before returning to his labors, however, Godbert asks that you meet him at the aetheryte plaza, hinting at a gift of some kind...</target>

His low opinion of PuPu, on the other hand, has not changed whatsoever, and he bids you stand ready for the moment the alien reveals his true colors. It is then that Godbert arrives to present you with a clockwork version of everyone's favorite little blue man. More than ever, the goldsmith is determined to progress with his weaponsmithing endeavor, and he remains amenable to your expert assistance.</target>
