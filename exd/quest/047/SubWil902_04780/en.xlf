        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;At the Drowning Wench, Nananji expresses his desire to know what motivated Louisoix to go so far as to sacrifice himself for a land not his own. If he had people near him in his final moments, the writer muses, they may be able to provide some insights─and by a fortuitous turn, Baderon, who chances to overhear your conversation, happens to know an individual who served among the Archon's guard at Carteneau. Known by the name of Orn Guincum, this former officer of the Maelstrom has since turned to adventuring, and there is a possibility he is presently at the Moraby Drydocks. Upon learning of this, Nananji immediately sets off, eager not to miss the opportunity to speak with the man.

        <target state="final">TEXT_SUBWIL902_04780_SEQ_05&lt;tab&gt;At the end of your search, you and Nananji come face-to-face with Orn Guincum. Recognizing you as the hero of Operation Archon, the man agrees to tell you his tale, and in grim tones recounts Louisoix's final moments. Even when Bahamut had broken free and all hells loose, he and his fellow guards were determined to stay at the Archon's side to the bitter end. Their charge, however, had beseeched them not to sacrifice themselves here, but to live and bear the light for others to follow. “Every soul who lives to determine their own fate is a source of hope”─with these words ringing in his mind, Nananji is reaffirmed in his belief that Louisoix was not an all-powerful savior one reads about in tales, but merely an ordinary man. Yet that man never forsook Eorzea, and stood for this realm to the last that all might know a brighter future. In this way, the budding writer has found not only an angle for Louisoix's biography, but newfound determination to tell the great man's tale.</target>

Though much work remains to be done, Nananji promises that he will not rest until the biography goes to print, and you look forward to the day every man, woman, and child may know the tale of the great Archon.</target>
