While they share knowledge of the present and memories of the past, you are to begin your advance into Pandæmonium.</target>

When you approach, you are greeted by a familiar face: Themis. Like Lahabrea and Erichthonios, he has been recreated by Athena's hand, though with more combat potential and less free will, if his words are to be believed. Not moments after this unsettling revelation, the spires of Pandæmonium twist into a monstrous foe─the better for Athena to test your scientifically improbable strength.</target>

Armed with knowledge of the Ultima Weapon and beyond, the ancient pair theorize that Athena stored her memories within the Heart of Sabik, which it transpires was created by none other than the megalomaniacal chief keyward herself. The Heart magnified the desires of its users to a fanatical degree, but by the time its dangers became apparent, it was too late. Lahabrea was forced to kill his wife, and though he closely guarded the Heart of Sabik to prevent the spread of its influence, it was this very caution that allowed Athena's memory to survive. With but one path before you, you must press forward to where Themis─and Athena─await.</target>
