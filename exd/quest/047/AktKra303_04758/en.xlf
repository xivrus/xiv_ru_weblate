        <target state="final">TEXT_AKTKRA303_04758_SEQ_01&lt;tab&gt;Given what you know so far, Lahabrea suggests that recent events likely began with Professor Claudien being lured to Azys Lla by the Heart of Sabik's aetherial signature, which led to Athena's awakening. Much remains unclear, however, and the only path to answers lies through Pandæmonium's final gate─and through Themis. While you do not relish facing your quondam ally in battle, you hold on to the hope that Athena's spell can be broken, and make ready to set forth to wherever he awaits.
