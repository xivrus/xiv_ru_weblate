He explains to you that he was a burden to Kipih in the past, and he doesn't wish to be a burden again. That is his motivation for wanting to become a capable adventurer who doesn't need to depend on others, and he struggles to see why that is wrong. In his search for an answer, he decides to consult Momodi, and makes his way to the Quicksand.</target>

Nhagi'a declares that he will no longer obsess over doing everything alone, having remembered why he became an adventurer in the first place. Relieved, Kipih takes the opportunity to remind him of how, as a young boy, he had told her that he wanted to simply be a free-spirited adventurer who traveled the world and lent a helping hand to those in need. Saddened to see that boy lose his way, Kipih had spoken sternly, but it was never her intent to deny him his calling, and she wholeheartedly supports him now as he continues on his path. Thus does the tale come to a happy conclusion, and you bid the two a fond farewell as they return to walking their respective paths.</target>

Even as the first chord resounds in your ear, you find yourself hurtling through unknown skies aboard an airship, where you meet with the mysterious Naoki Yoshida. The man thanks you for your enduring support, and shares his excitement for what yet lies ahead, before sending you back to reality. After you return to yourself on the streets of Ul'dah, the minstrel performs for you another song─one imbued with the hope that you will never forget whence you came, for therein lies the strength to forge on in the face of adversity.</target>
