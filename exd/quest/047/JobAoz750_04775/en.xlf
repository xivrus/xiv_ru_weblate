He goes on to explain that a bandit has been terrorizing any and everyone who passes through the Shroud. Such a man, both formidable and seemingly desperate for coin, would be a worthy choice to hire into the Celestium's employ. With his shift at the tavern ended, Martyn bids you follow him to Bentbranch Meadows.</target>

Much to your surprise, however, he has already been defeated by a band of blue mages. They explain that they initially came to test the limits of their magic, but are nevertheless grateful for the sizable bounty they will receive for turning in the bandit. The sizable bounty Martyn incidentally forgot to mention. Sadly, the bandit's defeat served only as proof that they were not the rival you were hoping for, and so your search must begin anew. While Martyn sets off in search of a new lead, he asks that you return to Ul'dah and report back to P'yandih.</target>
