At the recommendation of Stillglade Fane, many of the guild's lancers accordingly took up staves and crooks that they might wield the magicks of the conjurers and thereby help set the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state's people back on their feet. Five years on, this practice has become official policy, each new member of the Wood Wailers now being required to learn several basic restorative spells.

In a matter of months, the countryside was crawling with the seedkin. At first, we thought them to be harmless. We never saw them feed on other plants, and they never bothered us, no matter how close we got. That is, until we began seeing smaller yields in the fields where the mandragoras roamed. After watching them for a full season, we found that the podlings were using tiny roots on their feet to tap the soil of its nutrients. When we tried to remove the mandragoras ourselves, we learned that they were not as peaceful as we once thought... Now, we seek the aid of adventurers skilled in these sorts of matters to dispose of the nuisances.</target>

Conjurers' Guild officials believe the phenomenon to be the result of a pus gnat infestation. The pus gnat emits a scent similar to, but several times more potent than, that of the honeybee queen, causing soldiers and workers alike to abandon their normal duties and flock to the creature. The gnat, in turn, commands the bees to attack its foes in its stead. If something is not done immediately, it won't be long before all the hives in the Twelveswood are abandoned, and the flow of honey brought to a halt.</target>

To prevent the spread of leafbleed through ochus, the Trappers' League is offering a reward for the slaying of each afflicted seedkin.</target>

Caps of white, stew tonight.
My mother taught me that rhyme to make sure I never mistakenly ate the poisonous redcaps that grow throughout the Twelveswood. I also suppose she taught me it so that I'd bring home whitecaps for supper whenever I found them. While my duties here at the hut keep me from exploring the forest like I did when I was a girl, I still find that every now and then I crave a bowl of my mother's famous mushroom stew. My husband and I will pay a fair price for any whitecaps delivered to our home, but only if they have been handpicked, and not sliced clumsily from the ground with some brutish blade.</target>

The jaws dug deep, preventing me from removing the foul contraption from my leg. I shouted for help for three straight bells, but this was soon after the Calamity, and there were still few travelers in the area. Before long, the smell of my lifeblood soaking into the forest floor had attracted several hungry beasts, and I knew then that the end was nigh. I closed my eyes and began reciting my final prayers to the Matron...when a Qiqirn emerged from the trees, swiftly drove the beasts away, and removed the trap. If it had not been for that kind creature, I surely would have perished that day, and so ever since, I have invited the Qiqirn down from his hovel to dine at my cookfire. In recent years, he has grown old, and can no longer make the journey here himself, so I seek the services of kind adventurers to assist him on the road.</target>

        <target state="final">Rope a 'Lope&lt;tab&gt;Since the Calamity, the Trappers' League, in conjunction with Stillglade Fane and the Wood Wailers, has established a comprehensive set of guidelines regulating hunting in the Twelveswood in order to see diminished beastkin populations return to their Sixth Astral Era size. One of the animals covered in this edict is the antelope─the guidelines specifically stating that the slaying of any stag or doe under the age of three summers is strictly prohibited. The notorious band of poachers known as the Coeurlclaws, however, have little respect for Gridania's laws, and will often kill any and all creatures who enter their territory. To see that young antelopes are spared this fate, the Trappers' League seeks volunteers to help guide wayward does and stags away from the poachers' demesne.</target>

When this occurs, the birds can escape their corrals, costing the owners thousands of gil in retrieval costs. One way to prevent this type of mishap is by burying fence posts deep into the soil.

Should the trees become damaged, the forest would find itself more susceptible to outside danger. One manner of threat to these guardians is roselet seeds, which get lodged in pockets of soil that gather on a Hedgetree's trunk or limbs. Once sprouted, the roselet saplings will send a taproot deep into the tree's core, where it will divert the flow of nutrients to its own body. In severe cases, this can result in the withering of large branches. To ensure this does not happen, the Botanists' Guild seeks volunteers to travel to nearby Hedgetrees and examine the bark for seeds, removing any they find.</target>

        <target state="final">Axing for Fish&lt;tab&gt;Recently, I've been pondering regional Turali folklore, specifically that of the Yok Huy. One story claims that, having faced a crushing loss, their greatest warrior came to the &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;Sunken Stars&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; to weep.

Still, it'd be worth taking a dip in &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;the eastern waters of Marsh Ligaka&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; just in case.

There are fish in that river with razor-sharp teeth that will leap out of the water to attack you─especially if you're Pelupelu or what they otherwise deem an edible size.
