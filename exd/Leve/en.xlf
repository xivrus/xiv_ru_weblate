At the recommendation of Stillglade Fane, many of the guild's lancers accordingly took up staves and crooks that they might wield the magicks of the conjurers and thereby help set the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state's people back on their feet.

We ask no coin of those who seek our aid, and conduct our work solely with the alms provided us by the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state's few philanthropists. Charity, however, is a rare virtue in Ul'dah, and our “visitors” are forced to forgo many of the luxuries, such as a proper headstone or an embalming, that the wealthy are granted upon their passing. This inequity can kindle flames of wrath which can ultimately prevent a soul from completing its journey to the realm of Thal. These souls must needs be cleansed of their anger so that they may find peace, and we at the lichyard seek adventurers to aid us in doing so.</target>

Should the trees become damaged, the forest would find itself more susceptible to outside danger. One manner of threat to these guardians is roselet seeds, which get lodged in pockets of soil that gather on a Hedgetree's trunk or limbs. Once sprouted, the roselet saplings will send a taproot deep into the tree's core, where it will divert the flow of nutrients to its own body.

Which is why I've decided to try my hand at something different, if not to simply break the monotony. And what is that something, you ask? Why, use my mead-making knowledge to brew an even sweeter blend! But this time, instead of the usual honey, I plan on using maple sap! The only problem is, as a lifelong beekeeper, I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get the sap from the tree, which is why I need the help of skilled botanists. Bring me the maple sap I need, and I'll see that you are rewarded most handsomely!</target>

For instance, a Yok Huy mage is said to have gathered the stars and sealed them within a fish, which is why the night sky is no longer visible from the depths of the forest. Perhaps you can still find stars gleaming within fish that swim in &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;Cenote Jayunja&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;?

However, our bodies must first be cleansed by donning the mantle of an eel imbued with lightning energies. You will find such creatures in the depths of &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;Iq Rrax Tsoly&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;, a cenote found in the Xbr'aal's forests.

Needless to say, I have partaken of many a piscatory dish, but not always in pursuit of acquiring arcane prowess─sometimes, I'm simply hungry. A species replete with rejuvenating energies is known to meander the depths of &lt;var 48 F201F4 /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201F5 /var&gt;northern Lake Toari&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;.
