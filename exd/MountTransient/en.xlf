hearted creatures, but
they have their limits.

A single whistle and he will be at your side once again.&lt;tab&gt;In the five years following your sudden disappearance from the Carteneau Flats, your ever-faithful chocobo spent each waking moment galloping across the realm in search of his lost master.

        <target state="final">Summon forth your shroud of Darkness, a lingering sliver of the Cloud of Darkness's eldritch raiment.&lt;tab&gt;A sliver of the eldritch raiment worn by the Cloud of Darkness. Appearing to be perpetuated by residual aether, it shows no sign of dissipating and allows its wearer to fly freely. Though soft to the touch like the finest wool, the fog that clings to it results in a persistent clamminess.&lt;tab&gt;Darkness shall consume Light!

        <target state="final">Summon forth your dais of Darkness. Will not vanish beneath your feet after a set duration.&lt;tab&gt;A piece of the battlefield created by the Cloud of Darkness, upon which only those recognized by the being may set foot. While it has sent countless foes plummeting into endless void, by triumphing over its maker, you appear to have gained control over it.&lt;tab&gt;A well-maintained airship can mean
the difference between life and a
horrible, plummetin' death.

        <target state="final">Summon forth your hovering hot pot. Formerly a ritual cauldron, it now soars the skies while simmering with scrumptious morsels.&lt;tab&gt;Long ago, when a ritual cauldron was accidentally used to cook dinner for the lord of Yanxia, a strange phenomenon occurred which saw the vessel rise into the air like the fiery wheels of divine legend. Thereafter, subsequent generations of rulers took to filling the cauldron with various delicacies, which they enjoyed even as they hovered in the heavens.&lt;tab&gt;What is this? It smells...spicy.

Their luminous green hue exudes the determination of a recreated queen.&lt;tab&gt;Found within the virtual domain created by the Meso Terminal, these armor-clad wings are reminiscent of the dread entity that Sphene had become. While their origin is shrouded in mystery, they exude the unwavering determination of a ruler who placed her subjects above all else.&lt;tab&gt;My desire to protect my people

As a result, it exhibits magitek armor influences in its design, particularly in the area of its piloting system.&lt;tab&gt;If I am not mistaken, this would
not be the first time you've piloted
one of these suits.

In the part of the world whence it hails, a practice exists wherein dogs are sent to pay homage at distant shrines in their masters' stead.&lt;tab&gt;Oho, how enterprising!

Though created in bygone times to repel trespassers as a guardian, the removal of its core has rendered it harmless while additionally allowing it to serve as a mode of transport.&lt;tab&gt;How many times now have
you and yours hauled us

Guaranteed not to inconveniently melt while you are inside.&lt;tab&gt;Hollow on the inside and sustained by the power of eternal ice, this snowman garbed in fetching purple promises to keep its rider cool even in the hottest of climes. Rumor holds it is the perfect companion for those who wish to share their adventures with others, as well as those who wish to cheer others along on theirs.&lt;tab&gt;There's something strange about
these snowmen, yes, but...I can't
quite put my finger on it.

If it looks like a bird, flies like a bird, and cries like a bird, then it...could be a predatorial seedkin disguised as a bird.&lt;tab&gt;The branchbearer is employed as a companion plant in Gok Golma, where it protects crops by deterring pests with its aetheric emissions. In the past, the species was so aggressive that it was known to actively hunt animals for sustenance, but the Doppro people have succeeded in their domestication.&lt;tab&gt;Truly, a more effective deterrent
I could not imagine.

As this magic must be provided by passengers, it is recommended to ride in a group in order to avoid exhaustion.&lt;tab&gt;Go as a gale wind to
