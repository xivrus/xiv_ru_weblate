				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">Manifest your wings of resolve. Their deep-blue hue exudes the burden of a lost man.&lt;tab&gt;Calling to mind Zoraal Ja, King of Resolve of Alexandria, these magicked wings grant their wearer an aura of undying pride. Though they were discovered near the throne on the summit of Everkeep, the truth of their nature is shrouded in mystery.&lt;tab&gt;When the army fails in its duty,
it is the charge of the King of Resolve
to clean up its mess.

As dutiful as it is laidback.&lt;tab&gt;This fully grown mehwapyarra (“capybara” in certain other parts) was wandering alone in Shaaloani when it was attacked and swallowed whole by the tural vidraal Ttokrrone. Fortunately for the creature, you appeared and put down its devourer before it could be digested, and it now lends you its back out of a sense of duty.&lt;tab&gt;The Fury take these
ridiculous flying rodents!

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">Summon forth your rroneek. As your trusty steed, this creature can look forward to living to a ripe old age.&lt;tab&gt;Found grazing the plains of Xak Tural, this stoutly built beastkin has been prized since ancient times on account of fairly every part of it being a useful resource. Owing to its importance in their lives, many nomadic tribes revere it as their guiding animal, and migrate alongside it with the seasons.&lt;tab&gt;Well, you two look happier than
a pair of rroneek in the sun.

So impressed was it by your prowess, it chose to accompany you on your travels in hopes of witnessing more heroic feats.&lt;tab&gt;Like our esteemed ancestor, I will
fill the skies with beauteous songs!

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">Summon forth your automatoise, a weapon of war developed in Origenics.&lt;tab&gt;A weapon of war developed in Origenics, this giant tortoise has been augmented with a reinforced electrope skeleton and servomotors in order to enhance defense and strength. As the underlying creature is ordinarily mild-mannered, it is infused with the soul of a savage predator to lend it ferocity at the onset of battle.&lt;tab&gt;That strikes me as a rather curious thing to be
researching, but to each their own, I suppose!

				<target state="final" xml:space="preserve">Summon forth your mountain zu, and make ready to quench your thirst for adventure.&lt;tab&gt;This subspecies of the monstrous zu is known to inhabit the mountainous regions of the Near East. Seeking to tame the ill-tempered bird, Hannish alchemists fed it a specially concocted brew, which had the desired effect while causing the creature to give off a refreshing citrus aroma.&lt;tab&gt;I can't remember the last time
I felt so refreshed!
