Players begin with 13 tiles and draw a new tile each turn. They must then choose a tile to discard: either the new tile or one of the tiles in their hand. The player to the right then takes a turn, and the process is repeated until the end of the hand.

The first player to complete a winning hand is awarded points. A total of eight hands are played in a full match and four in a quick match, and the player who finishes with the most points is declared the winner.
Here is an example of a winning hand:</target>

A group of tiles is known as a “meld,” and the various types are explained in this guide. The combination of melds determines the difficulty of the hand and the points awarded when winning.

A game of Doman mahjong is divided into eight hands. The first round, in which the role of dealer passes to each player once, is called “East.” A triplet of east wind tiles forms a yaku in this round. The second round, “South,” allows a yaku to be formed with a triplet of south wind tiles.</target>

Each player is assigned a “seat wind” according to their seating position in relation to the dealer.

　Dealer = East
　Dealer's right = South
　Opposite the dealer = West
　Dealer's left = North

The seat wind for each player changes counterclockwise in this order: East, South, West, North. (This layout differs from the standard compass directions.) A triplet of wind tiles with the current seat wind forms a yaku.
The seat wind rotates together with the role of dealer, and players have a chance to easily form a yaku by paying attention to their seat wind marker.</target>

・Each player has a certain amount of time to take their turn. A tile will be discarded automatically if that player fails to act within the time limit. This time limit does not apply to four-player mahjong (kuitan enabled/disabled).
・A time limit applies to the period between hands. In addition, if a single hand lasts more than 80 minutes, the following hand will be the last one played. Once that hand ends, the game ends, final placements are decided, and the results are recorded.
・Each game has a time limit of 120 minutes, after which the game will end automatically. Results will not be recorded.

・If players abandon a match, it will continue without them and their tiles will be discarded automatically. They will also incur the standard penalties for abandoning a duty and will be unable to register for another mahjong match until the previous match ends.
・If players do not enter any commands for a certain amount of time, they will be automatically removed from the match.

A Rival Wings team consists of 6 light parties, for a total of 24 participants.
A match lasts for 15 minutes.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Retaliation■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Incapacitated players will be returned to their landing point, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay. Furthermore, players will be invulnerable so long as they remain at their landing point. This effect will persist for a brief period after returning to the battlefield.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Mounts■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Players are free to use mounts during Rival Wings campaigns. However, players taking damage while mounted will be afflicted with the Limp status effect.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Return■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Using Return will teleport players back to their landing point. Moreover, this action has no recast time during Rival Wings campaigns. Please note, however, casting will be interrupted by attacks.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■KDA■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Each time a player incapacitates an enemy player, they are awarded a knockout (K). When a player is incapacitated, they are classed as “down” (D). If a player deals damage to an enemy that is then incapacitated by a teammate, they are awarded an assist (A). The final K, D, and A for each player is displayed on the results screen at the end of the battle.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Rewards■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
When a match has ended, players will receive PvP EXP, PvE EXP, Wolf Marks, and Allagan tomestones.
By continually winning Rival Wings matches, players will receive achievements that reward special mounts and gear.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Damage Modifiers■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

Each team has two towers that serve to protect their core. Each tower is also enveloped in a defensive field that mitigates damage taken by team members and restores their HP, which players can take advantage of as protection when hard-pressed by the opposing team. If you succeed in destroying the enemy team's towers, the magitek field around the enemy team's base will dissipate, and your team will earn Soaring stacks.</target>

Each team has two towers which project a magitek field to guard the core. While both towers are present, the core cannot be damaged, and the field deals severe damage over time to any enemies that enter.
If one of the towers is destroyed, the defensive effect of the magitek field is weakened, allowing damage to be dealt to the core. In addition, the magitek field will no longer deal damage to enemies.
When both towers are destroyed, the magitek field disappears and the core will receive full damage from enemy attacks.</target>

Only one machina may be operated per party at any given time, regardless of type. In the case of the Oppressor, however, the limit is two per team. Two Brute Justices can be deployed by each team per match, one becoming available for each tower you lose.

When deploying a machina, its HP will be displayed in place of the player. Its HP cannot be restored by curative actions of teammates, nor will it restore automatically when out of combat. Machina actions will expend EP, a resource that can only be restored by using the Ceruleum Refill action. Be advised that use of this action will deplete your party's ceruleum stores.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Ceruleum■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Ceruleum is required to operate machina. A maximum of 100 units of ceruleum can be stored by each party. You can build up your ceruleum stores by collecting tanks in the field, controlling the power generator, or defeating enemy team members and mammets. As ceruleum is a party resource, it is recommended that you confer with your comrades prior to activating a machina.</target>

Ceruleum engines deliver supplies to loading stations. Players cannot enter a loading station while riding machina. Each team may occupy or control a loading station.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Occupying a Loading Station■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
When a ceruleum engine arrives at a station, standing in the area next to the engine will cause a gauge to fill. Once it is full, your team will occupy that station. The gauge fills more quickly when you have a higher number of team members near the engine than the opponent. The greater the difference in players, the quicker the gauge fills. However, only the first four players from each team are counted. Those standing near the engine will also gain the Sheer Will status, which greatly increases damage dealt. Making use of this status will help to reduce the number of enemies and occupy the station more quickly.

Once a loading station has been occupied, a new gauge will appear indicating your control over the station. When filled, the station will be under your team's control, allowing you to claim its supplies. This gauge will only fill when your team has a number of members equal to or higher than the opponent in that area.
When the supplies have been claimed, the ceruleum engine will leave the station and the gauges will be reset.</target>

There are four types of supplies. For the first half of the match, the ceruleum engine will deliver main ceruleum tanks, gobbiejuice, and gobtank keys at random. In the second half of the match, they will only deliver gobcrates.
Each type grants its own benefits and increases the Soaring stacks of the whole team.

Main Ceruleum Tanks
Each party on the team gains 50 ceruleum.

Gobbiejuice
Fills the limit gauge of every team member.

Gobtanks
Two gobtanks will appear at the core and will travel down the north and south routes to the enemy base. They are considerably more powerful than regular mammets and can deal severe damage to towers and the core.

Gobcrates
Grant all of the effects of main ceruleum tanks, gobbiejuice, and gobtanks.</target>

If the damage your team deals to a goblin mercenary surpasses that of the opposing team by a certain amount, it will join your side. If the mercenary's HP reaches zero before this condition has been fulfilled, it will form an alliance with whichever team dealt the most damage to it.

■Mercenary Deployment
Once you have formed an alliance with a mercenary, it will appear at your team's core and will attempt to destroy the enemy's towers and core, much like a mammet would. Forming an alliance with a mercenary that appeared from the north mercenary base will cause it to travel along the northern route, with the same being true of the south mercenary base and southern route.
Mercenaries are also governed by the Contractual Obligation status, and they will leave the field of battle once the status counts down to zero. After a certain amount of time passes, they will reappear from their respective base and will no longer be allied with either team.</target>

If you no longer wish to own a particular plot of land, select “Relinquish Land” from the Housing menu. Please note that the purchasing price will not be refunded.
Before land can be relinquished, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
　1. All furnishings must be removed from the property.
　2. All furnishings must be removed from storage.

　2. Once the estate hall has not been entered for a total of forty-five days (Earth time), it will be demolished, and the plot will be put up for sale.
While any member of a free company may enter a company estate hall to prevent auto-demolition, only the owner can prevent the auto-demolition of a private estate.

■Reclaiming Funds and Furnishings Following Auto-demolition
In the event your estate is demolished and your plot is sold, you will be able to claim indemnification for 80% of the plot's value. Furthermore, furnishings which can be safely removed will be stored for safekeeping by the resident caretaker. However, you must speak with the resident caretaker within thirty-five days (Earth time) of auto-demolition to reclaim funds and furnishings.
In the case of free company estates, this can only be performed by members with authority to purchase and relinquish land.

        <target state="final">Growing and Harvesting Crops
■Planting Seeds
Seeds require soil to grow, which comes in various types and affects the quality and number of crops. The speed at which they grow depends on the seeds used.

■Fertilizing Crops
Fertilizer can be used to enrich the soil and accelerate growth.

■Removing Crops
If crops are not harvested, they will eventually die. If this occurs, or if you no longer need a certain crop, you have the option to remove it.

■Harvesting Crops
Once crops are fully grown, you can harvest them.

■Intercrossing
When different crops are grown in adjacent ridges, you may occasionally receive new types of seeds when harvesting.

Aquariums are available in four sizes, the smallest holding only a single small fish, and the largest holding up to four. Because larger fish take up more room in the aquarium, one must choose carefully which fish they will put on display.

■Deleting a Message
Messages can also be deleted by the player who penned them, as well as by the estate owner and those with authorization.

■Liking a Message Book
Before leaving an estate, visitors can show their love of the house and its décor by leaving a “like” in the message book.
Characters are granted ten likes to distribute upon first viewing a message book, and accumulate an additional five likes per day at &lt;var 06 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 08 DB ((&lt;var 09 DB02030405060708090A0B0C0D02030405060708090A0B0C /var&gt;)) 0D /var&gt; &lt;var 08 E0DB0D ((p.m.)) ((a.m.)) /var&gt; (Earth time) up to a maximum of fifty.

■Selling Items Equipped to Mannequins
Access the mannequin and choose “Select gear to sell” to open the Mannequin Shop Settings window. Only sellable items in your inventory, Armoury Chest, or retainer inventory may be selected.

Any items equipped on a mannequin that are listed for sale still occupy slots in the retainer's list. For that reason, a mannequin cannot be equipped with items that would cause the retainer to exceed the 20 item limit.

■Selling as a Set
By checking “Sell Only as Set,” you can sell all items equipped to the mannequin together. While the items may be viewed on the market board, a player must access the mannequin directly if they wish to purchase the set.

When viewing items listed on the market board as part of a set, it is possible to send a tell to the seller to ascertain the location of their estate. 
※Please be aware that it is possible to view the name of a character selling a set through the market board.

■Displaying Gear
You may also display items on a mannequin without listing the gear for sale. It is also possible to select unsellable items for display.
※The mannequin cannot be used to display glamoured items.

However, gear that is displayed also occupies slots in the retainer's list of items for sale on the market, despite not being available for purchase.

        <target state="final">Frontline is a PvP challenge which engages three teams of adventurers, each team representing one of the three Grand Companies. Players will be randomly assigned to one of these three teams, regardless of their Grand Company allegiance. Each team consists of up to 24 players in an alliance, allowing for a grand total of 72 players in a single battle.
Success on the front line will depend heavily not only on individual skill, but on your ability to work as a team.</target>

A Frontline alliance consists of 24 members, divided into 3 full parties. There are 3 alliances, which combine for a total of 72 participants.
A match lasts for 20 minutes.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Retaliation■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Incapacitated players will be returned to their Grand Company's landing, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay. This will not incur a weakness penalty.
Furthermore, players will be temporarily invulnerable when leaving their Grand Company's landing.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Mounts■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Players are free to use mounts during Frontline campaigns. However, players taking damage while mounted will be forced off and afflicted with the Hoofing It status effect for five seconds.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Return■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Using Return will teleport players back to their landing point. Moreover, this action has no recast time during Frontline campaigns. Please note, however, casting will be interrupted by attacks.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■KDA■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Each time a player incapacitates an enemy player, they are awarded a knockout (K). When a player is incapacitated, they are classed as “down” (D). If a player deals damage to an enemy that is then incapacitated by a teammate, they are awarded an assist (A). The final K, D, and A for each player is displayed on the results screen at the end of the battle.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Rewards■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
When a match has ended, players will receive PvP EXP, PvE EXP, Wolf Marks, and Allagan tomestones.
By continually winning Frontline matches, players will receive achievements that reward special mounts and gear.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Damage Modifiers■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

At the start of each match, all locations will be unoccupied. By remaining in close proximity to the flags at these locations, players can occupy them to improve their team's tactical rating.

Every three seconds, tactical points will be accrued as follows:
　・When occupying one key location, an increase of 2
　・When occupying two key locations, an increase of 4
　・When occupying three key locations, an increase of 6
　・When occupying four key locations, an increase of 10
　・When occupying five key locations, an increase of 12
　・When occupying six key locations, an increase of 14
　・When occupying seven key locations, an increase of 18
　・When occupying eight key locations, an increase of 20
　・When occupying nine key locations, an increase of 22

While standing in key locations, players will be buffed with the status Sheer Will, greatly increasing damage dealt. The location will become occupied more quickly when you have a higher number of team members near the flag than the opposing alliances. The greater the difference in players, the quicker it will be occupied. However, these areas may turn neutral should enemies come within proximity of a flag controlled by your team, or vice versa.</target>

Upon their return to the island following the fall of Dalamud, Allied forces discovered Allagan tomeliths containing a wealth of knowledge. They concluded that the entire island was in fact an Allagan construct─a proving ground for Omega and other technology they developed to combat the primal threat. As was the case in Carteneau, control of the island and its resources remain disputed, and peaceful negotiations have failed to achieve a resolution. And so, once more, they would settle the matter on the battlefield.</target>

All Allagan tomeliths are inactive at the start of the campaign, and will activate randomly at set intervals. Each tomelith has a limited quantity of data that can be retrieved, and will become inactive once that limit is reached. As the campaign progresses, the maximum number of simultaneously active Allagan tomeliths will change.

Active Allagan tomeliths will be either “Unoccupied” or “Occupied” depending on whether or not a Grand Company has occupied them. If a player occupies an unoccupied tomelith, its status will change from Unoccupied to Occupied. If the tomelith is already occupied by an opposing faction, accessing the tomelith will change its status to Unoccupied. Tomeliths are Unoccupied when they change from inactive to active. Attempts to occupy a tomelith will be interrupted if the player is attacked.

Allagan tomeliths will activate at one of three ranks: B, A, or S. Although tomeliths have a lower chance to activate at higher ranks, they hold a larger quantity of data that can be retrieved while they are occupied. As the match progresses, tomeliths will have an increased chance to activate at higher ranks.

When claimed, an ovoo gradually increases a team's tactical rating. A claimed ovoo cannot be seized by the opposition; however, after a certain amount of time has elapsed, it will revert to being inactive again.</target>

When an ovoo begins activating, it will randomly be assigned a rank: B, A, or S. While higher-ranked ovoos are rarer, they increase a team's tactical rating at a faster rate. The closer it is to the center of the battlefield, the greater the likelihood that an ovoo's rank will be high.

As the battle progresses, the number of ovoos that can be simultaneously active will decrease. At the same time, the likelihood that they will activate at a higher rank will increase.</target>

        <target state="final">■Basic Rules
Up to 24 players may join an Ocean Fishing voyage, solo or in parties of up to eight members. Players will be matched together to form a full party when participating solo or with a party of fewer than eight members. Each voyage will sojourn at three locations before returning to Limsa Lominsa.

■How to Participate
Speak with Dryskthota at the ferry docks to register as a crew member and board the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Endeavor&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;. Registration periods last for 15 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time). If registering as a party, the party leader must register. The ship will depart when 24 crew members have been assembled or the registration period has ended, even if there are fewer than 24 crew members. Registration times may be viewed from the Sailing Schedule.

Progressing through the main scenario will give access to an additional route known as the Ruby route. Details on how to  unlock this route can be found from the Sailing Schedule.

■Rewards
By meeting certain conditions while fishing during the voyage, players will receive achievements that reward special titles, mounts, and minions. Fishers who are level 50 or above and have completed the requisite quest may also receive gatherers' scrips as rewards.</target>

Players can enter Save the Queen areas solo or in a party. It is possible to form a party even after entering the instance.

■Requirements
A Disciple of War or Magic level 71 or higher is required to enter.

■Restrictions
Once inside, you are free to change to any Disciple of War or Magic that meets the requirements to enter. However, you cannot change jobs while participating in a critical engagement.

All forays in Save the Queen areas are level synced, with character levels adjusted to 80, and all equipment adjusted to item level 430. Furthermore, materia bonuses will be ignored, regardless of the item level of gear affixed with materia. Any experience points gained will apply to your job level prior to level sync.</target>

After being incapacitated, using Return to retreat from the battlefield to a nearby encampment will incur an additional penalty of lost mettle. This penalty can also be incurred by leaving the instance while incapacitated.

The amount of mettle lost is dependent on your Resistance rank. It is worth noting, however, your rank cannot go down as a result of losing mettle. Furthermore, no penalty will be incurred below Resistance rank 5.</target>

Lost actions are special abilities that can only be used in Save the Queen areas. To acquire these actions, players must first find forgotten fragments, which drop occasionally when participating in skirmishes and critical engagements. These fragments can be examined by a Resistance appraiser, transforming them into lost actions.
There are a variety of lost actions to be found, some requiring a certain Resistance rank before they can be used. Any lost actions you have obtained will be automatically stored in the lost finds cache.

■Uses and Restrictions
There are six types of lost actions: offensive, defensive, restorative, beneficial, tactical, and detrimental. In certain cases, they may also be used as items rather than traditional actions.
It should be noted, however, that no one job can master them all, as each action has specific job requirements to use them.</target>

        <target state="final">■The Basics
Designed for solo players, this tournament mode pits registered participants against each other in contests of up to eight opponents.

■How to Participate
Speak with the Open tournament official in the Gold Saucer to register for the next available competition. &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Registration periods last for 30 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time).&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

The tournament will begin when 8 participants have been assembled or once the requisite amount of time has elapsed since the registration period began. If there are fewer than 8 participants available, NPCs will sit in for any missing players. Registration times may be viewed via the Open tournament schedule.

■Rewards
MGP, Triple Triad cards, and other prizes will be awarded at the end of a tournament, with final rankings and win rate determining the reward amount. Titles and items are also available as achievement rewards.

In the case that multiple players earn the same ranking, the MGP amount for the ranking reward will be adjusted accordingly. </target>

        <source>424</source>
        <target state="final">■Tournament Style
An Open tournament consists of three matches, with participants earning points based on the outcome of each game: 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and zero points for a loss. At the culmination of the third match, the participant with the most points is declared the victor.

In addition to victory points, the final number of captured cards is also recorded for each match. In the case that participants end the tournament with equal points, the player who most dominated the card grid over the course of the competition is awarded a higher ranking.

■Matching Opponents
For the first match, opponents are decided by pairing off the 8 participants at random. For the second and third matches, players are pit against whomever shares the closest point total at that stage in the tournament.</target>

This handy feature will automatically choose the strongest cards available.

Please note that while card options are randomized for each player, the number of rare cards on offer will always be the same.

■Rulesets
Speak with the tournament official and view the schedule to see which rules will be in effect for the upcoming competitions. Each tournament will be marked as having either a “basic” or “advanced” ruleset.

With the exception of Draft, basic tournaments have no advanced rules in play. All that is required to enjoy these matches is an understanding of the standard Triple Triad rules.

Advanced tournaments are for players who prefer their card battles with an extra layer of complexity. In addition to Draft, these contests will also feature advanced rules such as Same or Plus.

The Open tournament schedule will switch back and forth between basic and advanced rulesets, so you won't need to wait long before your preferred style of competition rolls around!</target>

■How to Participate
Players seeking the thrill of tournament play can form a party and register to enter the Triple Triad Invitational Parlor via the Duty Finder. In the case that a player registers solo, or a party has less than 8 members, the missing numbers will be made up by Triple Triad regulars or Gold Saucer employees.

■Rematches
At the end of an Invitational tournament, you will have the opportunity to organize a rematch. If every player agrees to the rematch, you can begin a new tournament with the current participants without needing to leave or re-register the party. Up to three rematches are available per tournament registration.</target>

I found out that 2B and 9S accessed the spheres before this all started, which is why they knew about the machine lifeforms' plans to take over our world. They added their own data to that of the machine lifeforms when copies were being made─like some sort of technological virus, apparently─so that they could come here and stop the machines.

They were our allies, from beginning to end...

■Applying Instant Portraits
Generally, when a gear set is equipped, the portrait linked to it will be automatically applied as your instant portrait.
※You must change your equipment via the gear set to apply its corresponding portrait.

■Display Requirements
In order for an instant portrait to be successfully displayed, its corresponding gear set must be marked with an “E” for “Equipped” in the portrait editor, and the portrait in question must match both the current gear and appearance of your character. If the gear/appearance of your character is different from that of your instant portrait, the portrait used to introduce your character will revert to a default image.</target>

Earning sufficient PvP experience will increase your PvP rank. Raise your rank to unlock both PvP and Grand Company-specific achievements.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Wolf Marks■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
This exclusive currency can be exchanged for gear and items by speaking with the mark quartermaster in the Wolves' Den.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Series EXP■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Series EXP is another variety of experience earned from playing PvP content. Increasing your Series level will unlock special Series rewards, as will continuing to accrue Series EXP after reaching the Series level cap of 30. Any levels gained above 30 will be tracked as “extra levels.”

Please note that “Series” itself indicates a specific predetermined period in which you may earn rewards. After a Series ends, a new one will begin, and available rewards will change accordingly─though rewards earned during one Series can still be claimed until the next has finished. Make sure to check your Series level and claim any earned rewards via the PvP Profile!

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Trophy Crystals■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Trophy crystals are earned as Series rewards, and can be exchanged for gear and items by speaking with the crystal quartermaster in the Wolves' Den.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Experience Points■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Participating in PvP content will earn you not only PvP-related experience, but experience for your current class and job as well. In Frontline and Rival Wings, which allow you to change jobs during the match, this experience will be applied to the job with which you registered for duty.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Allagan Tomestones■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

        <target state="final">There are three types of matches in Crystalline Conflict─casual, ranked, and custom. The primary difference among these is that ranked matches affect players' risers and tiers, and thus their overall ranks as well.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Casual Matches■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Losing or winning a casual match has no effect on riser or tier.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Ranked Matches■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Loss or victory in these competitive matches affects participants' risers and tiers. Thus, when playing a ranked match, you will be matched with players of similar tier and riser to your own. Furthermore, a match can only take place on selected data centers, which alternate each season.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Custom Matches■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Custom matches allow participants to customize their group, arena, and other match settings. Members may be recruited via the Party Finder. The results of a custom match will not be reflected on Player PvP profiles, count toward achievements, or affect risers or tiers. Additionally, PvP EXP, Series EXP, Wolf Marks, and similar rewards cannot be earned during custom matches.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Arenas■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Both casual and ranked matches are held in a variety of different arenas. The staging ground currently in play rotates periodically according to Earth time.</target>

Each player will rate in one of six tiers─Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, or Crystal. Players ranked in or below the Platinum tier will never drop down to a lower tier during that season. However, it is possible to drop to a lower tier from the Diamond or Crystal tiers.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Riser■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
The sub-levels within each tier are called “risers.” The number of risers varies per tier, with three risers each for Bronze and Silver, four for Gold and Platinum, and five within the Diamond tier. Regardless of tier placement, it is always possible for players to drop down to a lower riser.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Rising Stars■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
When you win a ranked match, you will gain one Rising Star. Similarly, a loss will remove one Star. Once you have earned the maximum three Rising Stars in one riser, an additional win will allow you to move up a riser. Winning three or more matches in a row while in the Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Diamond tier will apply a streak bonus, netting you two Rising Stars per win.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■The Crystal Tier■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Once you have reached Crystal, the highest tier, victory and defeat will be reflected by your Crystal Credit, rather than Rising Stars. The amount of Credit you earn or forfeit in matches is determined by the difference in average Credit between your team and the opposing team. Streak bonuses do not apply to Crystal Credit.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Resets■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
At the end of each season, the tier and risers of all participants will be lowered, the amount by which will vary between seasons.</target>

To win, one team must move the tactical crystal from the center of the field to the goal point. If neither team accomplishes this during the time limit, victory will be awarded to the team with greatest progress. “Progress,” displayed on the HUD throughout the match, indicates the maximum progress a team has made in bringing the tactical crystal toward their goal at any point during the match─as opposed to its current position relative to either goal─and thus will never decrease even should the crystal be reclaimed by the opposing team.

If neither team reaches the goal by the time limit, and progress for both teams is tied or the team with lower progress score is currently within the ring around the tactical crystal, the match will proceed into overtime. During overtime, the victory conditions differ depending on both teams' progress.

・Should your team have the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime, you must keep the entire opposing team out of the ring around the tactical crystal for three seconds to win.

・Should the opposing team have the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime, you must beat their progress score during overtime to win.

・Should the teams have equal progress scores upon the commencement of overtime, you must beat the opposing team's progress score during overtime to win.

Should neither team fulfill victory requirements by the end of overtime, the following conditions will apply:

・The team with the greater progress score will be awarded victory.

・If teams have equal progress scores, the team with the greater progress score upon the commencement of overtime will be declared the winner.

・If teams had equal progress scores upon the commencement of overtime and have equal progress scores by the end of overtime, victory will be awarded to the team that moved the tactical crystal closest to the goal point. If the tactical crystal remains at the center of the field, the match will end in a draw.</target>

        <target state="final">Once the tactical crystal is unbound, a ring will appear at its base. Should one team be fully in control of this ring─with no members of the opposing team present within its bounds─that team will be able to move the crystal.

The crystal can only be moved along the crystal line─a dedicated path within the arena. It will move faster when:
・It reaches a stretch of the line through which the same team has moved it before.
・The controlling team's progress is less than that of the opposing team.

The Clear Progress gauge will fill when the team attempting to clear the checkpoint has more players in the crystal's ring than the opposing team, and the gauge will fill faster the larger this discrepancy is.</target>

Each arena comes equipped with medicine kits. Accessing these kits will restore a player's HP.

Medicine kits cannot be claimed by those whose HP is at 100%, and each can only be claimed by one player. Once a kit has been claimed, a replacement will be generated after a set period of time has passed.</target>

・A soft landing, nullifying the typical damage taken from turbulence.
・An effect increasing attack speed and movement speed for a short time.
・A boost to the limit gauge.

Crystalline Conflict matches can be entered via the Duty Finder. To register, participants must use a job of level 30 or above, and may not be part of a preformed party.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Role Requirements■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
There are no restrictions on the balance of roles within a team. However, there cannot be two players of the same job on one team.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;■Time Limit■&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
A standard match lasts five minutes. In the event that neither team claims victory in the allotted time, the match will go into overtime, which may last up to ten minutes.

Incapacitated players will be returned to their base, where they will be allowed to rejoin combat after a short delay─however, this delay increases with each incapacitation. Players will return to their senses with HP and MP fully restored and all action recast timers reset. Furthermore, they will be invulnerable so long as they remain at their base. This effect will be lost upon returning to the battlefield.

To begin, enable Water mode from the islekeep's index. While the mode is active, select the desired plot to water it. Empty plots may also be watered, should you be so inclined.

Furthermore, plots will automatically be watered when it rains while you are on your island.

■Moisture Level
A plot's level of moisture has the following four stages:
 &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;“Soaked,” “Wet,” “Moist,” and “Dry.”
Crops will grow happily and heartily when the soil is between soaked and moist, and will cease to grow upon becoming dry.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

A plot will be soaked immediately after being watered, and its moisture level will gradually decrease until it has become dry.

・Soaked:
The maximum level of moisture.
&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;A plot cannot be watered at this stage.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Active for approximately six hours after watering a plot.

・Wet
A moderate level of moisture.
&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Plots may be watered at this stage.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
Active between approximately six to twenty-four hours after watering a plot.

・Moist:
The lowest level of moisture.
Active between approximately twenty-four to thirty-six hours after watering a plot.

・Dry:
The level at which a plot is bereft of moisture.
Active approximately thirty-six hours after watering a plot.
&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Crops will be unable to grow on plots that have reached this stage.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

To begin, enable Gather mode from the islekeep's index. While the mode is active, select a fully grown crop to harvest its yield. With the plot now empty, you may plant seeds into it once again.

Crops require sufficient time and water to grow, and have four stages of development:
&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;“Sprout,” “Seedling,” “Blossom,” and “Produce.”&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

Speak with the produce producer after obtaining the appropriate mammet-sized tools to get started.

Please note that you will not receive island experience points when retrieving yields harvested through the gardening service.

■Entrusting Your Crops
From the Cropland Management menu, choose the plot you wish the gardener to maintain, and select the “Entrust to Gardener” subcommand.

If seeds have already been planted in the plot you select, the same type of seed will automatically be applied for further cultivation. If the plot you select is currently empty, choose which seeds you wish to cultivate.

A daily fee of seafarer's cowries will be required to maintain your crops. Maintenance will be suspended if seafarer's cowries are insufficient, your supply of seeds has been exhausted, or if yields have accumulated to the maximum of 50. Plots will be marked “Under Care” if maintenance is proceeding smoothly and “Care Halted” if maintenance has been suspended.

The fee of seafarer's cowries will be automatically collected each day at &lt;var 06 12 /var&gt;&lt;var 08 DB ((&lt;var 09 DB02030405060708090A0B0C0D02030405060708090A0B0C /var&gt;)) 0D /var&gt; &lt;var 08 E0DB0D ((p.m.)) ((a.m.)) /var&gt; (Earth time) for all plots marked “Under Care.”

The care for plots marked “Care Halted” will resume automatically once the required conditions for maintenance have been achieved, and collection of the daily fee will resume accordingly.

■Ending Gardening Services
From the Cropland Management menu, select the plot you wish to exempt from gardening services, and choose either the “Dismiss Gardener” or “Collect Yield &amp; End Gardening Services” subcommand.

■Collecting Yields
Gardening mammets will harvest your crops for you, but these yields will not be added to your isleventory until you collect them.

From the Cropland Management menu, use either the “Collect Yield &amp; Resume Gardening Services” or “Collect Yield &amp; End Gardening Services” subcommand to collect your crops, and continue or quit gardening services, respectively.</target>

To begin, enable Feed mode from the islekeep's index, then approach an animal in the pasture equipped with the feed item of your choice to give it the tasty treat it deserves.

Feeding an animal will improve its mood and sate its appetite.

■Feed
There are three different types of animal feed available:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed, and premium island greenfeed.

Each feed can be crafted via the Sanctuary Crafting Log, and both types of greenfeed require produce yielded from the cropland.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;“Gleeful,” “Chipper,” “Content,” “Unhappy,” and “Hostile.”&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

・Island Sweetfeed
Improves an animal's mood by &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;one level.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; Can improve the mood up to &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;content&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;.

・Island Greenfeed
Improves an animal's mood by &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;two levels.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; Can improve the mood up to &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;chipper&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;.

・Premium Island Greenfeed
Improves an animal's mood by &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;two levels.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; Can improve the mood up to &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;gleeful&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;.

・Category
&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Every isleworks handicraft falls under a certain category, which in turn affects efficiency bonuses.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;The workshop's agenda is comprised of cycles and seasons.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

One cycle lasts 24 hours (Earth time), and one season lasts for seven cycles. &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;In other words, cycles are equivalent to Earth-time days and seasons to Earth-time weeks.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

Agendas for the current season and next season may be viewed from the Isleworks Agenda interface.</target>

        <target state="final">■Rest Cycles
As a conscientious employer, you are required to allocate 2 cycles of rest per season. During rest cycles, no handicrafts can be created.

You can schedule and review rest cycles by selecting the Set Rest Cycles option in the upper right-hand corner of the Isleworks Agenda interface.</target>

Mammets will automatically proceed with scheduled handicraft creation and shipping if all necessary materials have been acquired by the start of production. You may use your time freely while they work.

■Collecting Earnings
Once handicrafts have been successfully completed and shipped, you may collect your profits by speaking with the tactful taskmaster.</target>

        <target state="final">&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Efficiency bonuses will cause those handicrafts produced immediately after similarly categorized crafts to be produced twofold, thereby doubling earnings.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

Even though double the handicrafts will be created under an efficiency bonus, no additional materials are required.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Furthermore, efficiency bonuses may be chained.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

Using efficiency bonuses strategically can vastly increase your workshop's earnings.

■Limitations
Efficiency bonuses will not be applied to the same item created in sequence. Additionally, efficiency bonuses are only applicable within a given cycle, and will not carry over to the following cycle.

■Groove
When efficiency bonuses are triggered, your mammets' happy production groove will intensify. High groove scores will apply a further bonus to profits when handicrafts are shipped.

Groove is reset at the beginning of each season. Maximum groove attainable will also increase with the number of landmarks constructed on your island.</target>

Positioning moves the focal point both horizontally and vertically, and can be adjusted via the left stick on a &lt;var 08 E4E94C01 ((gamepad)) ((controller)) /var&gt;, or by right-clicking and dragging the mouse while the cursor is over your portrait.

■Rotation (Roll)
This slider, found below the portrait currently being edited, rotates the camera itself to adjust the direction of its focus.

Now that you have set an agenda, your faithful team of crafty mammets will create and export all the handicrafts you ordered while you bask in the sunshine and imbibe refreshing liquids.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;An isleworks potion takes four hours (Earth time) to produce.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; Remember: those who would judge a mammet for the time it takes to produce a handicraft are not worthy of that goodly mammet.

After the designated time has passed, put down your beverage long enough to speak with the tactful taskmaster once more, and your pockets will be filled with the earnings from your most recent export!

■Managing Materials
&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Materials used for the creation of a handicraft will be depleted at the start of production.

If you do not possess the required materials by the time production is scheduled to begin, your mammets will be unable to create the handicraft you ordered.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; They might even cry due to feelings of inadequacy.

So, if you did not have enough island palm leaves or islewort when you scheduled the isleworks potion, be sure to gather two of each by the time production is scheduled to start. Don't be the Warrior of Light who made a mammet cry.

You can keep track of what materials will be expended during current or upcoming production by clicking the Review Materials button.</target>

Navigating the nuances of market demand will offer you even greater profits than simply renovating your facilities or activating efficiency bonuses.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Items will be in one of the following four states of popularity: Very High, High, Average, and Low.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

The more popular an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Popularity may change at the beginning of a new season, but it will remain constant throughout that season.

・Supply
&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Items will be in one of the following fives stages of supply: Nonexistent, Insufficient, Sufficient, Surplus, and Overflowing.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

The less abundant an item is, the higher it will sell for.

Furthermore, the supply of handicrafts may change each cycle according to both commercial trends in Limsa Lominsa and the type/amount of items you sell from your island.

You can check shifts in demand from the previous cycle to the current one by referencing the “Demand Shift” column of the Supply &amp; Demand interface.

If you produce too much of the same product, the market will be inundated with it, causing supply to become “Overflowing.” Pay special attention to changes in the market when looking to create a large amount of a single kind of handicraft.</target>

        <target state="final">Mastering the intricacies of isleworks production and trade begins with a close examination of the materials available to you and the strategic implementation of efficiency bonuses.

For those islekeeps who feel like they have a firm grasp on the basics, the following tips will help you take your island industry─and earnings─to the next level.


■Popular Items Sell Even Better When Scarce
When a handicraft has High or Very High popularity, the inclination may be to produce large quantities of it, as popularity increases selling price. However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.

By waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.

Demand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.


■Start the Season Short and Efficient
Levels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.

To quickly activate efficiency bonuses, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Strategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;</target>

        <target state="final">With an agenda in hand and a team of eager mammets at your disposal, you are free to make any and all handicrafts your heart desires. However, a very special bonus awaits those who choose their schedules cleverly.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;The efficiency bonus will double the production of a given handicraft without requiring additional materials or production time.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

Doubling the production of a handicraft means you will have two handicrafts to export, and basic mathematics tells us that two handicrafts will sell for twice as much as one handicraft will. So what are you waiting for? Activate those efficiency bonuses by following the steps below!

■Activating Efficiency Bonuses
All handicrafts belong to at least one item category, such as “Concoctions” or “Confections.”

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Efficiency bonuses are activated by scheduling the production of similarly categorized items in direct succession.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

For example, an isleworks potion and isleworks firesand are both classified as “Concoctions.” By scheduling production of isleworks firesand right after your isleworks potion, you will activate an efficiency bonus that creates two pinches of isleworks firesand with the same time and materials it would normally take to make one!

But you don't have to keep track of all your bonuses in that steel-trap mind of yours─the text “Efficiency Bonus!” will appear on the agenda for items that will be produced twice as a result of your clever scheduling.</target>

      <trans-unit id="790" xml:space="preserve" approved="yes">
        <source>790</source>
        <target state="final">But wait! There's more.

What if you scheduled an isleworks potion, followed by a pinch of isleworks firesand, followed by &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;another&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; isleworks potion?

Thanks to efficiency bonuses, what might have been only three handicrafts has now been expanded to five! Think of the profits! Keep in mind both the type and order of handicrafts you add to your agenda, and you will be swimming in an abundance of seafarer's cowries in no time.

■Limitations of the Efficiency Bonus
Unfortunately, due to the peculiarities of the mammet's psyche, your tiny workers will not be nearly as excited making the same item twice in a row. While an isleworks potion/isleworks firesand combination will earn you an efficiency bonus, an order of isleworks potion/isleworks potion will get you nothing but some blinking and basic adherence to general protocol.

&lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;In other words, only different items belonging to the same category can activate efficiency bonuses.&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;

When aiming for bonuses, be sure you are scheduling different handicrafts. Variety, after all, is the spice of island life.</target>

        <target state="final">Now that you have taken your first steps down the path to profits, you may be curious as to how to increase your earnings even further than what a simple efficiency bonus might afford.

When you feel ready to take the plunge into the intricacies of the handicraft trade, access the Guide in your islekeep's index and check the section titled “The Workshop.”

But for now, perhaps continue enjoying that refreshing beverage─you've earned it!</target>

The crystal line intersects with these ringlike nests at checkpoints. Clearing any such checkpoint with the tactical crystal in tow will result in one of the following denizens emerging from within:

・Red Sands Antlion
The antlion will drag all players in range deep into the nest, rendering them immobile before erupting from the sands to deal massive damage.

・Sabotender
The sabotender will unleash 100,000 Needles upon all players in range. As the needles are split between affected players, the damage dealt to each player will change accordingly.

・Acutender
This rare and curious creature will unleash Therapeutic Needles upon all players in range, granting them a barrier effect. As the needles are split between affected players, the strength of the barrier granted to each player will change accordingly.

* If the match proceeds into overtime, monsters will no longer emerge from the sandpits.</target>

Heat waves atop the Red Sands will deal damage over time to all competitors. However, relief can be found at sandpits, from which balming geysers will erupt. Players standing in one of the small circular indicators on the ground will be soothed by sandpearl shrouds, granting the following effects:
・HP recovery.
・A boost to the limit gauge.

While the geyser is erupting, no creatures will emerge from the sandpit. Nevertheless, caution is advised, as the force of the geyser will deal damage to and knock back any who approach its center.</target>

There are two ways to check your current enmity level:

Should you be targeted, your defensive abilities can help keep you safe. For example, tanks can use Rampart to lower damage sustained as well as Reprisal to lower enemy damage output. For all other roles, check the Actions &amp; Traits menu to see which defensive abilities your job can learn.

        <target state="final">■Basic Rules
Players can enter the Occult Crescent solo or in a party. It is possible to form a party even after entering the instance.

■Requirements
A &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;Disciple of War or Magic level 100 or higher&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; is required to enter, and the &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;required average item level is 690&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;.

■Restrictions
Once inside, you are free to change to any Disciple of War or Magic that meets the requirements to enter. However, you cannot change jobs in certain circumstances, including while participating in a critical encounter.

All expeditions on the Occult Crescent are level synced, with &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;character levels adjusted to 100, and all equipment adjusted to item level 700&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt;.</target>

Discrepancies between your knowledge level and that of your enemies can greatly impact the outcome of a battle. Caution is advised when engaging a foe with a knowledge level greater than your own.</target>

Slaying foes with a knowledge level higher than your own will garner more knowledge. Players may choose to form parties and take on such adversaries to reap the increased knowledge reward.

Knowledge can also be earned by participating in critical encounters and FATEs across the island.

Your knowledge level and accrued knowledge will be retained between excursions─progress will not be lost when you depart the Occult Crescent.</target>

Players who leave the instance while incapacitated will also receive the aforementioned penalty.

Furthermore, &lt;var 48 F201FA /var&gt;&lt;var 49 F201FB /var&gt;if your knowledge level is above 5, incurring the penalty can decrease your knowledge level&lt;var 49 01 /var&gt;&lt;var 48 01 /var&gt; if your knowledge falls below zero as a result.</target>

Utilize your crafting or gathering abilities to collect a specific item. Upon reaching the requisite quantity, the mission is complete.

Disciples of the Hand may earn greater compensation by submitting high-quality items, whereas Disciples of the Land will be richly rewarded for items with a higher collectability rating. You can review the requisite milestones on the item help window.

■Race against Time
For these missions, the objective must be completed within the time limit, whether it's gathering a set quantity of items or fishing up different types of marine life. The faster you finish, the better your rating.

■Chains and Gatherer's Boon (Miners and Botanists Only)
Achieve as many successful chains and instances of Gatherer's Boon as possible. Upon achieving the requisite score, the mission is complete.

■Big Fish (Fishers Only)
For these missions, your rating is determined by the size of your fish. Some missions will evaluate your single biggest catch, while others measure the average size of your entire haul. Upon meeting the requisite size, the mission is complete.</target>

■Ground Support Bonuses
Ground supporters who make sufficient contributions to a mech op will receive bonus credits for a certain number of subsequent missions, regardless of objective. These bonuses are as follows:

Cosmocredits: +10
Lunar Credits: +10
