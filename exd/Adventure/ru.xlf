Таковы были слова торговца, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Эти доки обеспечивают безопасную стоянку основных отрядов Талассократического флота, также известного как Алая Флотилия. Во избежание саботажей, обычным гражданам запрещено посещение этого района. Однако, в ясные дни с вершины одного из бесчисленных пролётов Лимса Ломинсы можно заметить флагман армады — &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Триумф&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;.</target>

А следующим утром проснулся, за ноги подвешенный. Так-то, еле целым ушёл». Таковы были слова пирата, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Зарегистрированное как иностранное торговое судно, этот потрёпанный боями боевой корабль под управлением владыки закулисья региона — Хиллфира — служит точкой сбора разбойников, головорезов и прочих подозрительных личностей. Именно в этом месте многие пиратские команды находят в свои ряды новых рекрутов.</target>

Морякам песен не поют, но море сжирает нас всех одинаково». Таковы были слова старого моряка, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;«Я — ревущие волны, ветра перемен.
Я небо ночное, рассвета я тень.
Я морем рождён и им поглощён.»

В неглубокой пещере на юге от Ферм Летнего Брода находится древний монолит, на котором высечены эти слова — Реквием Моряков.</target>

Но при виде своих кораблей, уносимых ветром в далёкие страны, куда моя нога в жизни никогда не ступит, невольно думаю: „Что ж, мои пот и кровь проливались не зря, да?“» Таковы были слова рабочего, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Когда-то бывшая безграничными просторами ровных каменистых лугов, средняя Ла Ноша теперь разделена надвое отвесными скалами, прозванными Спуском. Для поддержки сухопутных торговых путей с восточных аванпостов Эльпорта и Бронзового Озера инженеры Ломинсы построили Небесный Подъёмник — башню из строительных лесов, блоков, лебёдок и шаров, что легче воздуха.</target>

Я мысленно представляю трудности моих предков, пока мои собственные заботы не улетучатся, и я не найду в себе силы идти дальше». Таковы были слова дозорного, и я вижу то же, что и она.&lt;tab&gt;Когда семьсот лет назад корабль «Галадион» стал жертвой ярости Навигатора и сел на мель у южных берегов Вилбренда, двум его рулевым, Жан де Невелю и Ги Ла Таграну, было поручено исследовать новообретённый остров. Первый направился на восток, а второй — на запад. Их маршруты и по сей день служат двумя главными магистралями в Ла Ноше.</target>

Встаньте на рассвете, заберитесь на ворота и посмотрите на покрытые росой поля внизу, а потом скажите мне, есть ли в королевстве место, где бы вы предпочли бы быть». Таковы были слова фермера, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Фермеры из «Красного петуха» не стесняются испытывать свои сельскохозяйственные навыки на экзотических культурах или непроверенных аграрных методах, гордясь своей готовностью пожертвовать урожаем, если это будет означать, что следующей осенью урожай будет лучше. Говорят, что название плантации произошло от кровавых петушиных боёв, устраиваемых после наступления темноты.</target>

Таковы были слова хранителя свечей, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Этот относительно новый маяк был построен вскоре после того, как Катаклизм уничтожил башню Свифтперч, которая обеспечивала безопасный проход торговых судов, перевозящих из Эльпорта партии тёмного крепкого и светлого ячменного вина. Кроме того, хранители свечей также следят и за всё более частыми приливными волнами, вызванными действиями повелителя глубин.</target>

Когда пасмурные дни омрачали моё настроение, я пробирался в гильдию и забирался так высоко, как только мог. Оттуда я наблюдал за работой кожевников внизу». Таковы были слова ремесленника, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Мастера гильдии кожевников из знаменитого в королевстве ателье «Фен-Илл» — лучшие во всей Эорзии. В последние годы мастерская стала известна благодаря работам гильдмастера Гевы, в которых описываются методы обработки и раскроя шкур, кожи и меха таким образом, чтобы отдать дань уважения их внутренним стихиям, и свести к минимуму количество отходов.</target>

Прошлой ночью я тайком выбрался из постели, чтобы пойти туда. Мама и папа заставили меня пообещать, что я больше никогда не буду туда забираться — ты ведь им это не раскажешь, правда?». Таковы были слова маленького мальчика, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Водопад Апкаллу был назван в честь неудачной попытки амбициозного торговца из Гридании вывести и размножить потомство апкаллу. Кроме того он знаменит тем, что когда-то служил пристанищем для героя Эорзии Луисуа Левейё и основанного им ордена «Круг Знающих».</target>

Таковы были слова конюха, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Как только был создан питомник «Дары мугла» и его птичник пополнился лучшими птицами Ишгарда, вокруг конюшен вскоре выросло целое поселение. Фирменный воздушный шар, привязанный к главному зданию, на самом деле является военным кораблем иксалов, который когда-то был захвачен распорядителями чокобо после того, как он запутался в лесных зарослях и был брошен его владельцами.</target>

Таковы были слова ботаника, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Этот возвышающийся до небес собор из слоновой кости был построен после Эры Бесконечных Морозов — мрачного периода, когда королевство было охвачено голодом и болезнями. Он служил убежищем и местом отдыха для всех, кто искал спасения, однако вскоре он пришёл в упадок и был практически забыт... пока в Седьмую Умбральную Эру не возникла необходимость в его возрождении.</target>

Передо мной в темноте пляшут огоньки, и я размышляю о том, какую гадость я мог бы натворить, будь я сильфом». Таковы были слова учёного, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Мало утешения будет даровано тем сильфам, которые выступят против призыва Повелителя Молний. Мало утешения будет завещано тем, кто покинет свои дома в Краю Сильфов и будет избегать своих обезумевших собратьев. Поэтому только в братстве сильфы могут обрести умиротворение, каким бы незначительным оно ни было.</target>

Таковы были слова присягнувшего клятве, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Во времена, когда султан единолично правил городом-государством, это место служило своеобразной приёмной для тех просителей, которые добивались аудиенции у Его Величества в Благоухающих покоях. Теперь, когда власть перешла в руки Синдиката, это место пустует, если не считать случайных свиданий между молодыми дворянами.</target>

Когда-то эта площадь предназначалась для частных балов султана, а теперь она открыта для публики из-за нехватки средств на содержание величественного парящего фонтана в её центре.</target>

Учёные Уль'ды, однако, считают его заблудившимся в хаосе Катаклизма гоббулем из Кёртаса, который после долгого путешествия через Чёрный Покров умер от истощения, достигнув Таналана.</target>

Учёные, присланные на Высокий мост для изучения этого места, в настоящее время придерживаются мнения, что эти строения являются не городом, а гробницей Лалафуто IV, знаменитого султана Белах'диа.</target>

When the fog descended, I snuck out across a collapsed pillar. Lucky to be alive, though I do wish I'd had the luxury to enjoy the view." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see what he saw.&lt;tab&gt;The discovery of mythril in a small copper mine in Bluefog triggered the Great Rush which saw would-be prospectors flock to the Sea of Spires in search of quick and easy fortune. The veins that ran through the mountains, however, were not deep, and it was but ten summers before the mines ceased to yield the precious metal, forcing many to abandon their claims. </target>

And though assailed on all sides by great metal shards fallen from the lesser moon Dalamud's crust, the ancient peak remained standing, a testament to the land's life force.</target>

I slipped and fell, and snagged me garments on something-or-another. I was enjoying the sight─till I realized how damned ridiculous I'd look if anyone came upon me. Dusted meself off and went on me way."&lt;tab&gt;Three hundred years ago, Ishgardian astrologian Adaunel the Younger convinced the Holy See that he could predict the comings and goings of the Dravanian Horde by studying the movements of the heavens, and thus secured funding for the construction of the First Dicasterial Observatorium of Aetherial and Astrological Phenomena and its grand astroscope.</target>

Now, in the endless winter wrought by the Calamity, the carcass rests in the permafrost under a thick blanket of snow, perfectly preserved since the day he was pierced through the heart by a ballista.</target>

To fend off the enemy horde, a complex web of defenses, magical and corporeal, has been added piecemeal to the city proper's outer walls, transforming her into an impenetrable bastion, while at the same time, isolating her and her people from the outside world.</target>

I knew that I must capture this sight in ink, lest others simply pass it by.&lt;tab&gt;In the old tongue of the elves, “Laxan” is the word for “Lakeland,” and it is here that the region's erstwhile king set his throne. The castle is also infamous as the site of a historical conflict, where the Shadowkeeper led a force of elven dissidents in a final, bloody uprising.</target>

The knight himself refused to fall, holding off the abominations until the smallfolk had reached safe refuge.</target>

I would capture this scene in honest words, for the truth requires no embellishment.&lt;tab&gt;Due to the abundance of reefs in Tuliyollal's coastal waters, marine visitors are forced to anchor their ships out at sea and board smaller vessels to make safe landfall. The harbor's name is no idle promise, as even boats with shallow drafts can be caught on rocks when the tide is low.</target>

I would capture this scene in honest words, for the truth requires no embellishment.&lt;tab&gt;Meaning “heartfire” in the Hanuhanu tongue, this lighthouse also once served as a watchtower for threats approaching from Xak Tural. These days, its only role is to warn coastal vessels away from the thundering waterfalls.</target>

I would capture this scene in honest words, for the truth requires no embellishment.&lt;tab&gt;Overseen by the eponymous Miplu, the cultivation of this mate tea garden has introduced lush greenery and fertile soil to Urqopacha's usual vistas of sparse vegetation. The operation has almost become a small village in its own right, with the number of field hands ever growing to match the garden's steady expansion.</target>

        <target state="needs-translation">Shades of Grief&lt;tab&gt;The sights of Urqopacha are wondrous to behold. I would capture this scene in honest words, for the truth requires no embellishment.&lt;tab&gt;These ruins brood silently at the cliff's edge. Once a Yok Huy village, it was abandoned as the giants' population dwindled, the crumbling stone houses inhabited now only by the shadows of past sadness. Locals speak of a road which long ago stretched from the settlement down into Chabayuqeq, but little trace of such a path remains.</target>

I would capture this scene in honest words, for the truth requires no embellishment.&lt;tab&gt;This village is inhabited by a faction of Yok Huy who deny the Dawnservant's sovereignty. Thought to have held a sea in ancient times, the valley here seeps with salt-laden spring water. The residents call this natural gift a “divine blessing,” and have built stepped salt fields into the slopes of the valley.</target>
