Таковы были слова торговца, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Эти доки обеспечивают безопасную стоянку основных отрядов Талассократического флота, также известного как Алая Флотилия. Во избежание саботажей, обычным гражданам запрещено посещение этого района. Однако, в ясные дни с вершины одного из бесчисленных пролётов Лимса Ломинсы можно заметить флагман армады — &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Триумф&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;.</target>

А следующим утром проснулся, за ноги подвешенный. Так-то, еле целым ушёл». Таковы были слова пирата, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Зарегистрированное как иностранное торговое судно, этот потрёпанный боями боевой корабль под управлением владыки закулисья региона — Хиллфиром — служит точкой сбора разбойников, головорезов и прочих подозрительных личностей. Именно в этом месте многие пиратские команды находят в свои ряды новых рекрутов.</target>

Морякам песен не поют, но море сжирает нас всех одинаково». Таковы были слова старого моряка, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;«Я — ревущие волны, ветра перемен.
Я небо ночное, рассвета я тень.
Я морем рождён и им поглощён.»

В неглубокой пещере на юге от Ферм Летнего Брода находится древний монолит, на котором высечены эти слова — Реквием Моряков.</target>

Но при виде своих кораблей, уносимых ветром в далёкие страны, куда моя нога в жизни никогда не ступит, невольно думаю: „Что ж, мои пот и кровь проливались не зря, да?“» Таковы были слова рабочего, и я вижу то же, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Когда-то бывшая безграничными просторами ровных каменистых лугов, средняя Ла Ноша теперь разделена надвое отвесными скалами, прозванными Спуском. Для поддержки сухопутных торговых путей с восточных аванпостов Эльпорта и Бронзового Озера инженеры Ломинсы построили Небесный Подъёмник — башню из деревянных строительных лесов, блоков, лебёдок и шаров, что легче воздуха.</target>

I turn my thoughts to the hardships of my forebears till mine own worries drift away, and I find strength to carry on." Such were the sentry's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;When the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Galadion&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; fell victim to the Navigator's fury and ran aground on the southern shores of Vylbrand seven hundred years ago, it was her two helmsmen, Jean De Nevelle and Guy La Thagran, who were tasked with exploring the newfound island─the former heading east, the latter, west. To this day, their routes still serve as La Noscea's two main thoroughfares.</target>

Looking upon those pillars, grotesque and beautiful, my thoughts drift to that fateful day five years ago." Such were the fisher's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;When struck by a fallen shard from Dalamud's outer shell, a massive amount of concentrated aether was released from just below the surface of the Rhotano Sea, immediately fusing with and crystallizing the towering fount of saltwater which was expelled during the impact.

Rise at dawn, climb atop the gate, and look upon the dew-kissed fields below─then tell me there's any place in the realm ye'd rather be." Such were the farmer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;The farmers on the Red Rooster Stead will rarely shy from testing their agricultural acumen on exotic crops or untested growing methods, and take pride in their willingness to sacrifice a harvest if it means a better yield an autumn hence. The plantation's name is said to be taken from the bloody cockfights held after nightfall by the gamekeeps.</target>

I step outside, and lose meself in the blue expanse above and below─me hard-earned reward for the ships I've seen to safety, I reckon." Such were the candlekeep's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;This relatively new lighthouse was built soon after the Calamity claimed Swiftperch Tower to ensure safe passage for trade vessels carrying shipments of dark stouts and blonde barleywines out of Aleport. In addition, the candlekeeps also keep watch for increasingly frequent rogue tidal waves caused by the stirrings of the Lord of the Whorl.</target>

When cloudy days sunk my spirits, I'd sneak into the guild, climb as high as my legs could carry me, and watch the tanners and tawers at work below." Such were the craftsman's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Crafters for the realm-famous Atelier Fen-Yll, the Leatherworkers' Guild boasts the finest tawers and tanners in all Eorzea. In recent years, the workshop has come to be known for its Geva patterns, which outline methods of working and cutting hides, pelts, skins, and furs in a way that honors the elementals within by minimizing waste.</target>

I snuck out of bed to go there last night. Mum and Dad made me promise I wouldn't climb up there anymore─you won't tell them, will you?" Such were the little boy's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Named after a failed attempt by an ambitious Gridanian merchant to hatch and breed apkallus in the linn, Apkallu Falls is most remembered for serving as a place of meditation for the late Louisoix Leveilleur, Circle of Knowing Archon and hero of Eorzea.</target>

Seein' him up there on a clear day, swayin' gently in the wind, it's enough to lull a man to slumber. Me, I settle for a stump and a moment's repose." Such were the stablehand's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Once Moogle's Gift Mounts was established and its rookery stocked with Ishgard's finest birds, it was not long before an entire settlement had grown up around the stables. The trademark balloon tethered to the main building is actually an Ixali war vessel claimed by chocobokeeps after it became tangled in a nearby tree and was abandoned by its riders.</target>

Such were the botanist's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;This sky-scraping ivory cathedral was built following the Age of Endless Frost─a dark period in which the realm was overrun with famine and disease─to serve as a place of refuge and respite for all who sought succor. Soon after, however, it fell into ruin and was all but forgotten...until the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era saw need for its rise once again.</target>

I may lack for wings, but a short climb will put me in a similar position. Lights dancing in the dark before me, I ponder what mischief I might make─er, were I a sylph, that is." Such were the scholar's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Little is the solace granted to those sylphs who would voice their opposition to the summoning of the Lord of Levin. Little is the solace bequeathed upon those who would abandon their homes in the Sylphlands and shun their frenzied brethren. Thus, it is only through fraternity that those sylphs may ultimately find solace, however little it may be.</target>

Paying reverence to those who came before us, I salute my sworn brothers who stand before me." Such were the Sultansworn's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;In times when the sultan had sole rule over the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state, the Promenade would serve as an ersatz waiting chamber for those petitioners who sought audience with His Resplendence in the Fragrant Chamber. Now, with power in the hands of the Syndicate, the round is empty, save for the occasional tryst betwixt young nobles.</target>

From vaulted gardens I leap onto the eastmost streetlamp, then bask as dour, cloudy expressions break into smiles and a shower of gil." Such were the acrobat's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;A large atrium in the heart of Ul'dah, the Gold Court's opulence and scale make it a popular meeting place for the city's elite. The plaza was once reserved for the sultan's private balls, but has since been opened to the public due to a lack of funds to maintain the majestic hanging fountain at her center.</target>

Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;The commercial hub of Ul'dah is organized strategically around the dome-shaped citadel at its center. Its towering fortifications and protective outer walls bedighted with myriad glass panes and colorful mosaics are visible for malms in all directions, and serve as a stark yet dazzling deterrent to would-be besiegers.</target>

My foot slipped, and in an eyeblink I was sprawled out on a cliff, the ruins of a buried city before me. Sadly, the stinging pain in my arse detracted somewhat from my enjoyment of the scenery." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;The city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;states of Ul'dah and Sil'dih coexisted for generations until four hundred years ago when bad blood festering betwixt the two sultanates culminated in the War of the Sisters─leaving Sil'dih a smoldering pile of rubble to be claimed by the shifting desert sands. The subsequent relocation of Ul'dah placed the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state nearly directly above her fallen sibling.</target>

Such were the botanist's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;Local legend claims the Lonely Giant is everything from the ghost of a Sil'dihn sultan, to the prototype for a new model of Garlean machina. Ul'dahn scholars, however, simply believe him a Coerthan goobbue who lost his bearings during the chaos of the Calamity, and after a long journey through the Black Shroud, died of exhaustion upon reaching Thanalan.</target>

I know not who once called it home, nor why it fell, but it was a sight to behold." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Buried under nearly a malm of solid rock, if not for a gaping rent torn open by the Calamity, these ancient ruins may have gone undiscovered for another thousand summers. Scholars sent to Highbridge to study the site are currently of a mind that the structures are not a city, but in fact the tomb of one Lalafuto IV, famed sultan of Belah'dia.</target>

Setting out at first light, I looked out upon the wise men of old─at least they looked wiser than me─and asked for guidance in my travels." Such were the merchant's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;After the Calamity rent eastern Thanalan asunder, one of the first projects commissioned by the Syndicate was the construction of a bridge to span the newly formed chasm and restore the trade route with lands transpontine. The city which has sprung up along its edges is populated almost solely by scholars investigating the nearby ruins of the Invisible City.</target>

Таковы были слова рабочего, и я вижу тоже, что и он.&lt;tab&gt;Небольшая долина, коей был Каньон шёпота вайды пять лет назад, превратилась в зияющее ущелье за несколько лун после того, как Катаклизм осушил Бронзовое озеро и значительно изменил русло реки Ним.

Summerford Farms and its expansive orange groves is one of those locations─its name is derived from the man-made crossings required when late spring runoff from Mt.

Quickly, I climbed to the roof and plotted a course of escape. Quite a view, though staying alive was a far more pressing concern at the time." Such were the merchant's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Sitting high atop Widow Cliffs on the southeastern coast of Vylbrand, the Grey Fleet was built to harness the constant southerly winds funneled down through the Strait of Merlthor, and use them to power the many mills which grind the region's wheat and full its wool.</target>

Such were the young lady's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;Sheltered on three sides by towering cliffs, Hidden Falls can be found several score yalms upstream from where the Agelyss River empties into the Strait of Merlthor. Taken by its beauty, Ul'dahn plutocrat Gegeruju was quick to purchase the land and construct a stage upon which private performances for the magnate's favored clients are held.</target>

Such were the lookout's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;One of three beacons built along the La Noscean coast in the Sixth Astral Era, Gullperch Tower is the easternmost─warning ships navigating the Strait of Merlthor of its deadly shallows, while also serving as a watchtower for pirate and Sahagin raids on Bloodshore.</target>

Such were the brewer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Carved centuries past by a famous Roegadyn sculptor, this massive stone effigy located in the center of Aleport's lower plaza serves as hallowed ground upon which sailors might offer solemn prayers to the watcher of the seas before embarking on their journeys across the untamed deep. </target>

Such were the lighthouse keeper's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;For centuries, ships wrecked off the shores of southern Vylbrand have been carried upon currents to this quiet inlet─a timeless reminder of the deep's boundless wrath. So many are the wooden corpses which populate this watery lichyard, it is said that for every hull visible above the waves, a score more slumber beneath.</target>

O'Ghomoro is the Floating City of Nym─central hub of a lost civilization which prospered on Vylbrand during the Fifth Astral Era.

Entranced, I reached for my quill and parchment...&lt;tab&gt;The ancient Allagans launched this Heimdall-class vessel into the heavens to monitor Bahamut's prison, Dalamud.

Entranced, I reached for my quill and parchment...&lt;tab&gt;The prime decision-making authority for an entire machine civilization, this mechanism has been faithfully reconstructed in Ostrakon Deka-hexi.

Entranced, I reached for my quill and parchment...&lt;tab&gt;This sector is a recreation of the third civilization encountered by Meteion and her sisters. Known collectively as the “Ea,” the entities which reside here have cast off their corporeal shells and endure eternally in purely spiritual form. An awareness of the universe's inevitable end, however, has blighted their immortal gift with existential misery.</target>
