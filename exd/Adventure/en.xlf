Such were the merchant's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;These docks provide safe mooring for the Thalassocratic Navy's principal squadrons, also known as the Crimson Fleet. To prevent sabotage, admittance to the area is forbidden to the general citizenry; however, on clear days, one may catch a glimpse of the armada flagship, the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Triumph&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;, from atop one of Limsa Lominsa's myriad spans.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162689" approved="yes"><source>2162689</source><target state="final">The &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Astalicia&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt;&lt;tab&gt;"A flagon or two o' grog havin' filled me 'ead with big ideas, I eyed that 'ive o' villainy from the pier, feelin' as if I could cut down Hyllfyr 'imself.

Such were the buccaneer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Registered as a trade vessel hailing from foreign waters, this battle-scarred warship captained by the lord of the region's underworld, Hyllfyr, serves as a gathering place for brigands, cutthroats, and the purveyors of sundry other breeds of villainy. It is here that the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state's many pirate crews find new recruits to join their ranks.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162690" approved="yes"><source>2162690</source><target state="final">Seasong Grotto&lt;tab&gt;"In a dank cavern that's never known the sun, the patter of the rain me only companion, I dropped to one knee and said me farewells to me ill-fated mates. They sing no songs for fishermen, but the sea swallows us all the same." Such were the old mariner's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;“I am the waves that bear, I am the winds that guide.
I am the evening stars, I am the morning sky.
I am born of the sea, and there shall I die.”

Nestled within a shallow cavern situated to the south of Summerford Farms sits an ancient monolith upon which is carved this, the Sailors' Requiem.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162691" approved="yes"><source>2162691</source><target state="final">The Skylift&lt;tab&gt;"Backbreakin', arse-bustin' work, it is. But seein' me vessels ridin' the winds, soarin' off to far lands where me legs will never carry me─well, at least me sweat and blood ain't been for naught, eh?" Such were the laborer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Once an endless expanse of flat, rocky meadows, middle La Noscea is now severed atwain by a sheer cliff known as the Descent. To maintain overland trade routes from the easterly outposts of Aleport and Bronze Lake, Lominsan engineers created the Skylift─a tower of wooden scaffolding outfitted with pulleys, winches, and lighter-than-air balloons.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162692" approved="yes"><source>2162692</source><target state="final">La Thagran Eastroad&lt;tab&gt;"When the skies turn grey and spirits sag, I climb high and look upon roads blazed long ago. I turn my thoughts to the hardships of my forebears till mine own worries drift away, and I find strength to carry on." Such were the sentry's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;When the &lt;var 1A 02 /var&gt;Galadion&lt;var 1A 01 /var&gt; fell victim to the Navigator's fury and ran aground on the southern shores of Vylbrand seven hundred years ago, it was her two helmsmen, Jean De Nevelle and Guy La Thagran, who were tasked with exploring the newfound island─the former heading east, the latter, west. To this day, their routes still serve as La Noscea's two main thoroughfares.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162693" approved="yes"><source>2162693</source><target state="final">The Salt Strand&lt;tab&gt;"Under the watchful gaze of the Wanderer, I cast a line to waters far below. Looking upon those pillars, grotesque and beautiful, my thoughts drift to that fateful day five years ago." Such were the fisher's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;When struck by a fallen shard from Dalamud's outer shell, a massive amount of concentrated aether was released from just below the surface of the Rhotano Sea, immediately fusing with and crystallizing the towering fount of saltwater which was expelled during the impact. City&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state-funded exploratory forays into the inner crater have all yet to return...</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162694" approved="yes"><source>2162694</source><target state="final">Red Rooster Stead&lt;tab&gt;"No romance in the farmin' life? Balderdash, I say! Rise at dawn, climb atop the gate, and look upon the dew-kissed fields below─then tell me there's any place in the realm ye'd rather be." Such were the farmer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;The farmers on the Red Rooster Stead will rarely shy from testing their agricultural acumen on exotic crops or untested growing methods, and take pride in their willingness to sacrifice a harvest if it means a better yield an autumn hence. The plantation's name is said to be taken from the bloody cockfights held after nightfall by the gamekeeps.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162695" approved="yes"><source>2162695</source><target state="final">The Brewer's Beacon&lt;tab&gt;"When dawn breaks, I quench the flame and pour meself an ale. I step outside, and lose meself in the blue expanse above and below─me hard-earned reward for the ships I've seen to safety, I reckon." Such were the candlekeep's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;This relatively new lighthouse was built soon after the Calamity claimed Swiftperch Tower to ensure safe passage for trade vessels carrying shipments of dark stouts and blonde barleywines out of Aleport. In addition, the candlekeeps also keep watch for increasingly frequent rogue tidal waves caused by the stirrings of the Lord of the Whorl.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162696" approved="yes"><source>2162696</source><target state="final">The Leatherworkers' Guild&lt;tab&gt;"Knew it was my calling ever since I was knee-high to a goobbue. When cloudy days sunk my spirits, I'd sneak into the guild, climb as high as my legs could carry me, and watch the tanners and tawers at work below." Such were the craftsman's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Crafters for the realm-famous Atelier Fen-Yll, the Leatherworkers' Guild boasts the finest tawers and tanners in all Eorzea. In recent years, the workshop has come to be known for its Geva patterns, which outline methods of working and cutting hides, pelts, skins, and furs in a way that honors the elementals within by minimizing waste.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162697" approved="yes"><source>2162697</source><target state="final">Apkallu Falls&lt;tab&gt;"My favoritest place is where I can see the falling water. There's a secret path that only I know. I snuck out of bed to go there last night. Mum and Dad made me promise I wouldn't climb up there anymore─you won't tell them, will you?" Such were the little boy's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Named after a failed attempt by an ambitious Gridanian merchant to hatch and breed apkallus in the linn, Apkallu Falls is most remembered for serving as a place of meditation for the late Louisoix Leveilleur, Circle of Knowing Archon and hero of Eorzea.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162698" approved="yes"><source>2162698</source><target state="final">Bentbranch Meadows&lt;tab&gt;"Cute little bugger, isn't he?

Such were the stablehand's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Once Moogle's Gift Mounts was established and its rookery stocked with Ishgard's finest birds, it was not long before an entire settlement had grown up around the stables. The trademark balloon tethered to the main building is actually an Ixali war vessel claimed by chocobokeeps after it became tangled in a nearby tree and was abandoned by its riders.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162699" approved="yes"><source>2162699</source><target state="final">The Sanctum of the Twelve&lt;tab&gt;"I've never been the pious type, but when the sun strikes those windows and the trees in the gardens glisten, even I find myself mouthing a prayer from time to time." Such were the botanist's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;This sky-scraping ivory cathedral was built following the Age of Endless Frost─a dark period in which the realm was overrun with famine and disease─to serve as a place of refuge and respite for all who sought succor. Soon after, however, it fell into ruin and was all but forgotten...until the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era saw need for its rise once again.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162700" approved="yes"><source>2162700</source><target state="final">Little Solace&lt;tab&gt;"To know the sylph, you must be the sylph. I may lack for wings, but a short climb will put me in a similar position. Lights dancing in the dark before me, I ponder what mischief I might make─er, were I a sylph, that is." Such were the scholar's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Little is the solace granted to those sylphs who would voice their opposition to the summoning of the Lord of Levin. Little is the solace bequeathed upon those who would abandon their homes in the Sylphlands and shun their frenzied brethren. Thus, it is only through fraternity that those sylphs may ultimately find solace, however little it may be.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162701" approved="yes"><source>2162701</source><target state="final">Royal Promenade&lt;tab&gt;"Come morning, when my watch is over, I stand upon the three plates of silver depicting the first three of our kind. Paying reverence to those who came before us, I salute my sworn brothers who stand before me." Such were the Sultansworn's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;In times when the sultan had sole rule over the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state, the Promenade would serve as an ersatz waiting chamber for those petitioners who sought audience with His Resplendence in the Fragrant Chamber. Now, with power in the hands of the Syndicate, the round is empty, save for the occasional tryst betwixt young nobles.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162702" approved="yes"><source>2162702</source><target state="final">The Gold Court&lt;tab&gt;"Even the strings of the tightest purse loosen upon seeing my famed balancing act. From vaulted gardens I leap onto the eastmost streetlamp, then bask as dour, cloudy expressions break into smiles and a shower of gil." Such were the acrobat's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;A large atrium in the heart of Ul'dah, the Gold Court's opulence and scale make it a popular meeting place for the city's elite. The plaza was once reserved for the sultan's private balls, but has since been opened to the public due to a lack of funds to maintain the majestic hanging fountain at her center.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162703" approved="yes"><source>2162703</source><target state="final">The Jewel of the Desert&lt;tab&gt;"From a vantage point high above Nophica's Wells, I looked out upon Ul'dah in all its glory─truly a jewel in the desert, shining brighter than a sea of stars." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;The commercial hub of Ul'dah is organized strategically around the dome-shaped citadel at its center. Its towering fortifications and protective outer walls bedighted with myriad glass panes and colorful mosaics are visible for malms in all directions, and serve as a stark yet dazzling deterrent to would-be besiegers.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162704" approved="yes"><source>2162704</source><target state="final">The Ruins of Sil'dih&lt;tab&gt;"The fog was so thick you could cut it with a blade. My foot slipped, and in an eyeblink I was sprawled out on a cliff, the ruins of a buried city before me. Sadly, the stinging pain in my arse detracted somewhat from my enjoyment of the scenery." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;The city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;states of Ul'dah and Sil'dih coexisted for generations until four hundred years ago when bad blood festering betwixt the two sultanates culminated in the War of the Sisters─leaving Sil'dih a smoldering pile of rubble to be claimed by the shifting desert sands. The subsequent relocation of Ul'dah placed the city&lt;var 1F /var&gt;state nearly directly above her fallen sibling.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162705" approved="yes"><source>2162705</source><target state="final">The Lonely Giant&lt;tab&gt;"Merciful are the rains that fall, for they give succor to the thirsting land, and comfort the old wounds of one who journeyed too far from home." Such were the botanist's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;Local legend claims the Lonely Giant is everything from the ghost of a Sil'dihn sultan, to the prototype for a new model of Garlean machina. Ul'dahn scholars, however, simply believe him a Coerthan goobbue who lost his bearings during the chaos of the Calamity, and after a long journey through the Black Shroud, died of exhaustion upon reaching Thanalan.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162706" approved="yes"><source>2162706</source><target state="final">The Invisible City&lt;tab&gt;"As I felled my quarry atop a great stone slab, my eyes drifted up to a city swallowed by the clouds and the mountain itself. I know not who once called it home, nor why it fell, but it was a sight to behold." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Buried under nearly a malm of solid rock, if not for a gaping rent torn open by the Calamity, these ancient ruins may have gone undiscovered for another thousand summers. Scholars sent to Highbridge to study the site are currently of a mind that the structures are not a city, but in fact the tomb of one Lalafuto IV, famed sultan of Belah'dia.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162707" approved="yes"><source>2162707</source><target state="final">Highbridge&lt;tab&gt;"En route from Ul'dah to Gridania, I sought lodgings at Highbridge. Setting out at first light, I looked out upon the wise men of old─at least they looked wiser than me─and asked for guidance in my travels." Such were the merchant's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;After the Calamity rent eastern Thanalan asunder, one of the first projects commissioned by the Syndicate was the construction of a bridge to span the newly formed chasm and restore the trade route with lands transpontine. The city which has sprung up along its edges is populated almost solely by scholars investigating the nearby ruins of the Invisible City.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162708" approved="yes"><source>2162708</source><target state="final">Woad Whisper Canyon&lt;tab&gt;"Don't tell Baderon, but if ye ask me, ye'll find no better place to down a flagon of ale than where the water dances, keepin' ye cool on even the 'ottest summer's day." Such were the laborer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Little more than a shallow valley but five years past, Woad Whisper Canyon was carved into a gaping gorge in a matter of moons after the Calamity drained Bronze Lake and dramatically altered the course of the Nym River. On hot days, laborers from both Summerford Farms and the Skylift will oft take respite in the cool mists of the falls...if not met by bandits.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162709" approved="yes"><source>2162709</source><target state="final">Summerford Farms&lt;tab&gt;Overheard at a tavern: "Erstwhile pirates taken to land, drunk on ale and tales of wenches and plunder, climb atop lamps as if they were manning the crow's nest of a great vessel..."&lt;tab&gt;When Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn rose to Admiral, one of her first decrees included the clearing of large swaths of land for new Lominsan settlements. Summerford Farms and its expansive orange groves is one of those locations─its name is derived from the man-made crossings required when late spring runoff from Mt. O'Ghomoro causes the Rogue River to swell.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162710" approved="yes"><source>2162710</source><target state="final">The Grey Fleet&lt;tab&gt;"I took refuge inside to get away from the rain. To my ill fortune, the beastmen had the same idea. Quickly, I climbed to the roof and plotted a course of escape. Quite a view, though staying alive was a far more pressing concern at the time." Such were the merchant's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Sitting high atop Widow Cliffs on the southeastern coast of Vylbrand, the Grey Fleet was built to harness the constant southerly winds funneled down through the Strait of Merlthor, and use them to power the many mills which grind the region's wheat and full its wool.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162711" approved="yes"><source>2162711</source><target state="final">Hidden Falls&lt;tab&gt;"The ogling from the men as they recline burns brighter than the summer sun. I don't mind much, provided they're handsome...and wealthy doesn't hurt either." Such were the young lady's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;Sheltered on three sides by towering cliffs, Hidden Falls can be found several score yalms upstream from where the Agelyss River empties into the Strait of Merlthor. Taken by its beauty, Ul'dahn plutocrat Gegeruju was quick to purchase the land and construct a stage upon which private performances for the magnate's favored clients are held.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162712" approved="yes"><source>2162712</source><target state="final">Gullperch Tower&lt;tab&gt;"The rains may cloud our view, but they won't stop those who would invade our shores. And so we climb high, scouring the horizon for any sign of danger." Such were the lookout's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;One of three beacons built along the La Noscean coast in the Sixth Astral Era, Gullperch Tower is the easternmost─warning ships navigating the Strait of Merlthor of its deadly shallows, while also serving as a watchtower for pirate and Sahagin raids on Bloodshore.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162713" approved="yes"><source>2162713</source><target state="final">The Navigator&lt;tab&gt;"I've no wife, an' no mind to take one─the only child I'll ever know is the ale I brew. And so, as the cargo ships pull out of the harbor, I say a prayer to the watcher of seas, that She'll see me sons safe to someone's belly somewhere." Such were the brewer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Carved centuries past by a famous Roegadyn sculptor, this massive stone effigy located in the center of Aleport's lower plaza serves as hallowed ground upon which sailors might offer solemn prayers to the watcher of the seas before embarking on their journeys across the untamed deep. </target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162714" approved="yes"><source>2162714</source><target state="final">The Ship Graveyard&lt;tab&gt;"If yer wise, ye won't look too closely. It's not just flotsam the dark tides drag in, and there are sights what could haunt the bravest of men for life. Aye, ye'll not catch me dead going there─least of all at night." Such were the lighthouse keeper's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;For centuries, ships wrecked off the shores of southern Vylbrand have been carried upon currents to this quiet inlet─a timeless reminder of the deep's boundless wrath. So many are the wooden corpses which populate this watery lichyard, it is said that for every hull visible above the waves, a score more slumber beneath.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162715" approved="yes"><source>2162715</source><target state="final">Camp Skull Valley&lt;tab&gt;Overheard at an inn: "There's an outpost with quite a view of the land, but you'll want to steel yourself well if you mean to go there..."&lt;tab&gt;Now a strategic outpost for the Maelstrom, Camp Skull Valley was once but a circle of tents occupied by a meager Yellowjacket unit charged with surveilling the area for kobold incursions. Those beastmen foolish enough to venture down from O'Ghomoro were slaughtered and beheaded─their skulls put on display as a warning to others.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162716" approved="yes"><source>2162716</source><target state="final">Tidegate&lt;tab&gt;Overheard at an alehouse: "When I've misplaced my goods, I climb atop the tents and scour the ground below.

To prevent any further swells of the beastman forces, a massive wall was erected between the enemy-occupied lowlands and the allied Skull Valley.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162717" approved="yes"><source>2162717</source><target state="final">Camp Bronze Lake&lt;tab&gt;Overheard at a tavern: "Nothing like feeling the cool breeze on your skin after a hot bath. The view's nothin' to sneeze at, either..."&lt;tab&gt;The formation of great underwater fissures during the Calamity saw nearly half of the water comprising Bronze Lake vanish in the span of a single night. The result was the uncovering of ancient Nymian ruins submerged for thousands of years─most notably, the Wanderer's Palace, a temple dedicated to the god Oschon.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162718" approved="yes"><source>2162718</source><target state="final">Thalaos&lt;tab&gt;"Under the burning sun, I climbed to the tip of the ancient one and turned my thoughts to the days when it roamed the deep.

Such were the scholar's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;Though there is no proof to support the claim, rumor has these sun-bleached remains of a long-dead denizen of the deep are those of one of the legendary twin sea serpents believed to have been unleashed by the Navigator, Llymlaen, at the dawn of eras to fill the empty seas (the other being Perykos).</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162719" approved="yes"><source>2162719</source><target state="final">Jijiroon's Trading Post&lt;tab&gt;Overheard at a tavern: "Spent the night on that ledge, I did─anything to escape those shelled monstrosities.

The other is Memeroon's Trading Post, run by Jijiroon's estranged sibling, to whom the stubborn Qiqirn merchant hasn't spoken in twenty summers.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162720" approved="yes"><source>2162720</source><target state="final">The Floating City of Nym&lt;tab&gt;"There were islands floating in the sky, and crystals that shone like terrestrial stars. Even now, I wonder if it was but a dream..." Such were the fledgling adventurer's words, and I would see as she saw.&lt;tab&gt;Suspended high above the foothills of Mt. O'Ghomoro is the Floating City of Nym─central hub of a lost civilization which prospered on Vylbrand during the Fifth Astral Era. The accepted theory as to how the city was torn from the realm involves the over-aspecting of corrupted wind crystals─a phenomenon witnessed late in the Sixth Astral Era.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162721" approved="yes"><source>2162721</source><target state="final">Camp Overlook&lt;tab&gt;Overheard at an inn: "You'll want to keep a wide berth of brigands and beastmen both.

Either that or the fumes have gotten to me head..." Such were the soldier's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;The brilliant rainbow-colored hues that permeate the otherwise bistre slopes of O'Ghomoro are a result of the endless flow of toxic slumgullion streaming forth from the labyrinthine warrens that make up U'Ghamaro Mines. As more kobolds arrive on the surface each day, there is a scramble to construct new forges to accommodate them.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162723" approved="yes"><source>2162723</source><target state="final">The Hermit's Hovel&lt;tab&gt;"Someone actually lives there?

Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;While few have ever seen the lord of this humble hideaway which rests precariously on the edge of an unscalable precipice─let alone obtained his permission for entering the premises─that has not stopped travelers from taking full advantage of the respite the location offers, whether it be a dip in the steaming pools, or a few bells' slumber on the soft goosefeather bed.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162724" approved="yes"><source>2162724</source><target state="final">The Carline Canopy&lt;tab&gt;Overheard about town: "There's nothing quite like standing beside the mighty waterwheel, watching brave men and women as they come and go."&lt;tab&gt;Nestled cozily within the inn known as the Roost lies the relaxing Carline Canopy, a haven for those seeking a respite from travel's travails or questing's quandaries.

Climbing to what I thought the perfect vantage point, I earned no praise, only thorough scolding from my instructor." Such were the guardsman's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Founded by legendary Wood Wailer captain Mistalle, the Lancers' Guild doubles as a headquarters for those who keep the peace within Gridania, and the greater peace without. It is to these “Wailing Barracks” that people come with matters whose resolution requires a polearm's edge, and justice meted out to those who have wronged the forest or forestborn.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162726" approved="yes"><source>2162726</source><target state="final">The Bannock&lt;tab&gt;"My subordinates have a knack for disappearing from time to time, but not to worry.

Such were the guard captain's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Built around the stump of a fallen heavenspillar, the Bannock serves as training grounds for Order of the Twin Adder initiates. There are several theories regarding the origin of the area's name, some claiming it is taken from the hardtack issued to Grand Company recruits, others that it is derived from the training stump's resemblance to those selfsame rations.</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162727" approved="yes"><source>2162727</source><target state="final">Haukke Manor&lt;tab&gt;"I fled as fast as my legs could carry me, till I stood atop massive tree roots with nowhere to run. The glow from the windows, so beautiful, yet so terrible..." Such were the madman's words, and I would see as he saw.&lt;tab&gt;Long frowned upon by the people of Gridania as a symbol of excess, the Seedseers would finally submit to pressure from the citizenry, selling the deed to the manor to Lady Amandine of House Dartancours. The word “Haukke” is of ancient Padjali origin and means, “to speak without words.”</target></trans-unit><trans-unit id="2162728" approved="yes"><source>2162728</source><target state="final">The Guardian Tree&lt;tab&gt;"When I feel I have lost my way, I look down upon the ancient arbor under the shining sun.
