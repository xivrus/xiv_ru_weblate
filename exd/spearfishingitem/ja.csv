"","Though the waters surrounding the Isle of Ken can sink to frigid temperatures, this freshwater fish thrives by generating copious amounts of body heat. This internal aetheric reaction is far more than simple thermoregulation, however, as the flesh of this creature retains its uncanny heat even after trimmed and gutted.","ケンの島近辺に棲息する淡水魚。水温が下がると体内エーテルを活性化させ発熱する。常にじんわりと温かく、捌いた魚身も同様の保温性がある","","False","0x00004F09","",""
"","This bivalve mollusk is of such a clear and delicate color, it perfectly resembles an errant petal plucked from a flower in the blush of spring. Perhaps this is why the pixies were so quick to name it for their forebear Glorianda, in imitation of the Jenanna's tear of Longmirror Lake.","桜色に澄んだ殻体を持つ二枚貝。春の花の花弁を思わせる貝殻を、姿見の湖に棲息するジェナーナの涙粒になぞらえ、妖精たちに名付けられた","","False","0x00004F0A","",""
"","This wavekin's mottled green pattern gives it the impression of being clad in weathered bronze─a perception not far from the truth. Its scales, suffused by the mineral waters of Bronze Lake, are known to contain traces of rare metal.","銅が酸化した緑青の色のような、金属的なまだら模様の輝きを持つ。鱗はブロンズレイクの水質に含まれる稀少金属が含まれるとされる","","False","0x00004F0B","",""
"","Known─and named─for its unique style of swimming, this freshwater fish skips rapidly from rock to rock as it traverses the lake floor. It does this not for the sheer joy of living, but to inflict a swift, unpredictable death upon the smaller wavekin that it hunts for food.","湖底の石と石の間を、跳ね飛ぶように泳ぐ魚。この独特の泳法は、小魚や海老などの意表をついて捕食するための技なのだという","","False","0x00004F0C","",""
"","Legend has it that this smooth-scaled eel of dark bronze came into existence only after a lancer hurled a slain comrade's spear into the lake. The story fails to mention whether the lancer was ever aware of this miraculous genesis, or if it sparked a craze of submerging postmortem mementos in large bodies of water.","黒褐色の細長い魚体は、使い込まれた銅製品のような滑らかさ。とある槍術士が死んだ戦友の愛槍を湖に捧げたところ、命を得たとの伝承が残る","","False","0x00004F0D","",""
"","This member of the peacock bass family is recognizable for its bold stripes, the deep green markings a stunning reflection of the lake's emerald waters. Spearfishers consider this fish one of the region's prize catches.","「ピーコックバス」と総称される魚種のひとつで、湖の色を映したかのような緑色の大縞が特徴。ブロンズレイク刺突漁の名物魚の1匹である","","False","0x00004F0E","",""
"","The scales of this distinctive trout range from a deep olive green to a gleaming bronze brown. Its crimson flesh is highly sought after by fishermen, who equate the darker hue with a richer─and thus more expensive─flavor.","深緑から銅褐色へと揺らぐ体色が特徴的なトラウト。身は鮮やかな紅色で、体色が濃いほど魚味も豊かであるとして漁師たちの人気が高い","","False","0x00004F0F","",""
"","This “unexpected predator,” as naturalists have dubbed it, is a surprisingly harmonious cog in the local ecology. Despite its prehistoric appearance, the massive nosceasaur appears to consciously avoid disrupting the food chain's delicate equilibrium.","大型の捕食動物でありながら生態系を乱さず、「想定外の捕食者」との学名を持つ。高い知能で周囲の環境との共栄関係を築いているとされる","","False","0x00004F10","",""
"","An abundant mollusk, the empyreal spiral is the source of many of Saibai Cavern's beautiful shells and, in turn, its name. The shells have long been used in the artisanal works of Sui no Sato─in particular, a pigment that shimmers with rainbow hues.","サイバイ洞、すなわち採貝の洞との名の由来となった貝。工芸品の素材としてスイの民には古くから知られており、胡粉に加工すると美しい虹色を生む","","False","0x00004F11","",""
"","As its name suggests, the opal tetra's scales gleam with brilliant color. Indeed, it is no less precious than a gem to aquarists, who firmly believe that the mere sight of the iridescent wavekin can cure most ails.","オパールの遊色模様のように輝く鱗を持ち、泳ぐ宝石とも呼ばれる。見ているだけで癒やされるとして、観賞魚の愛好家たちにも人気が高い","","False","0x00004F12","",""
