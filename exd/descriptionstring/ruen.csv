Players begin with 13 tiles and draw a new tile each turn. They must then choose a tile to discard: either the new tile or one of the tiles in their hand. The player to the right then takes a turn, and the process is repeated until the end of the hand.

The first player to complete a winning hand is awarded points. A total of eight hands are played in a full match and four in a quick match, and the player who finishes with the most points is declared the winner.
Here is an example of a winning hand:","","","False","0x00000021","",""

"","Each of the four players begins with 13 tiles, and the dealer─who is chosen automatically─plays first.
That player draws one new tile and chooses one tile to discard. This may either be the new tile or one from their hand.
Once that player has discarded a tile, the player to the right takes a turn. This process is repeated until the end of the hand.","","","False","0x0000002C","",""

If the dealer has to pay another player, they must pay double.","","","False","0x00000031","",""

If a player discards a tile that allows another player to form a winning hand, only the player that discarded the tile must pay.

When a player is one tile away from a winning hand, riichi may be declared.","","","False","0x00000046","",""

In the case shown in the diagram, if the declaring player receives a 3 or a 6 of Dots, whether the tile is drawn by the player or discarded by another player, a winning hand can be called.
After declaring riichi, that player can no longer put drawn tiles into their hand. Any tiles drawn will automatically be discarded until a tile that completes the winning hand is obtained. However, a winning hand achieved through riichi is a yaku in itself. Therefore, the player does not need to have formed any other yaku to complete a winning hand.","","","False","0x00000047","",""
"","■ Properties of Riichi
　1. The player's hand automatically becomes a yaku, regardless of whether it contains any other yaku.
　2. The other players know that the one declaring riichi is one tile away from a winning hand.
　3. The declaring player cannot replace any of the tiles in their hand.
　4. The declaring player must pay 1,000 points─indicated with a point stick placed in the center of the table─which go to the winner of the hand.

"","■ Round-specific Conditions
A game of Doman mahjong is divided into eight hands. The first round, in which the role of dealer passes to each player once, is called “East.” A triplet of east wind tiles forms a yaku in this round. The second round, “South,” allows a yaku to be formed with a triplet of south wind tiles.","","","False","0x0000004D","",""
"","■ Seat-specific Conditions
Each player is assigned a “seat wind” according to their seating position in relation to the dealer.

　Dealer = East
　Dealer's right = South
　Opposite the dealer = West
　Dealer's left = North

The seat wind for each player changes counterclockwise in this order: East, South, West, North. (This layout differs from the standard compass directions.) A triplet of wind tiles with the current seat wind forms a yaku.
The seat wind rotates together with the role of dealer, and players have a chance to easily form a yaku by paying attention to their seat wind marker.","","","False","0x0000004E","",""
"","11. Pon and Chi","","","False","0x0000004F","",""
"","It is difficult to form a winning hand relying solely on drawn tiles. However, tiles discarded by other players can be claimed by using “pon” and “chi.”","","","False","0x00000050","",""
"","■ Pon
If you have a pair of matching tiles, when another player discards a tile that can be used to form a triplet, you may call pon to claim the tile.","","","False","0x00000051","",""
"","■ Chi
Calling chi allows you to claim a number tile discarded by another player and complete a straight. However, it can only be called for the player whose turn comes before yours.","","","False","0x00000052","",""

"","■ Drawback 1: Revealing Your Hand
Using pon or chi to form a triplet or straight will cause it to be revealed to the other players. In addition, you can no longer use those tiles for any other melds.
This can lead to missing opportunities to form better hands as a result of having those tiles locked into a triplet or straight.","","","False","0x00000054","",""
"","■ Drawback 2: Preventing Riichi
It is not possible to declare riichi after using pon or chi.
Due to being unable to form a riichi yaku, you must find a way to form a different yaku. There are also certain yaku that can only be formed on the condition that you have not used pon or chi, so these will also become unavailable.

"","12. Dora Bonuses","","","False","0x00000056","",""
"","In each hand, certain tiles are selected as “dora” and will grant bonus han simply for being included in a winning hand. While dora apply han bonuses, they are not in themselves yaku, so a yaku must be formed in order to take advantage of dora.","","","False","0x00000057","",""
"","■ Dora
A dora tile is randomly selected at the start of each hand and is displayed throughout.","","","False","0x00000058","",""
"","■ Aka Dora

"","■ Ura Dora
When calling a winning hand after declaring riichi, the “ura dora” is revealed. This is only shown after the winning hand has been called and is nothing more than a surprise bonus, although it provides added incentive to try declaring riichi.

"","Since there are four of each tile, it is possible to collect all four. This is known as “kan.”","","","False","0x0000005C","",""
"","Although kan is not in itself a yaku, it awards additional bonuses when calculating the points earned by a winning hand. Kan also increases the number of dora, which may offer further advantages.

Speak with the Open tournament official in the Gold Saucer to register for the next available competition. <var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Registration periods last for 30 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time).<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

The tournament will begin when 8 participants have been assembled or once the requisite amount of time has elapsed since the registration period began. If there are fewer than 8 participants available, NPCs will sit in for any missing players. Registration times may be viewed via the Open tournament schedule.

■Rewards
MGP, Triple Triad cards, and other prizes will be awarded at the end of a tournament, with final rankings and win rate determining the reward amount. Titles and items are also available as achievement rewards.

In the case that multiple players earn the same ranking, the MGP amount for the ranking reward will be adjusted accordingly. ","","","False","0x000001A7","",""
"","■Tournament Style
An Open tournament consists of three matches, with participants earning points based on the outcome of each game: 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and zero points for a loss. At the culmination of the third match, the participant with the most points is declared the victor.

In addition to victory points, the final number of captured cards is also recorded for each match. In the case that participants end the tournament with equal points, the player who most dominated the card grid over the course of the competition is awarded a higher ranking.

■Matching Opponents
For the first match, opponents are decided by pairing off the 8 participants at random. For the second and third matches, players are pit against whomever shares the closest point total at that stage in the tournament.","","","False","0x000001A8","",""

Please note that while card options are randomized for each player, the number of rare cards on offer will always be the same.

■Rulesets
Speak with the tournament official and view the schedule to see which rules will be in effect for the upcoming competitions. Each tournament will be marked as having either a “basic” or “advanced” ruleset.

With the exception of Draft, basic tournaments have no advanced rules in play. All that is required to enjoy these matches is an understanding of the standard Triple Triad rules.

Advanced tournaments are for players who prefer their card battles with an extra layer of complexity. In addition to Draft, these contests will also feature advanced rules such as Same or Plus.

The Open tournament schedule will switch back and forth between basic and advanced rulesets, so you won't need to wait long before your preferred style of competition rolls around!","","","False","0x000001AB","",""

■How to Participate
Players seeking the thrill of tournament play can form a party and register to enter the Triple Triad Invitational Parlor via the Duty Finder. In the case that a player registers solo, or a party has less than 8 members, the missing numbers will be made up by Triple Triad regulars or Gold Saucer employees.

■Rematches
At the end of an Invitational tournament, you will have the opportunity to organize a rematch. If every player agrees to the rematch, you can begin a new tournament with the current participants without needing to leave or re-register the party. Up to three rematches are available per tournament registration.","","","False","0x000001AC","",""

When you win a ranked match, you will gain one Rising Star. Similarly, a loss will remove one Star. Once you have earned the maximum three Rising Stars in one riser, an additional win will allow you to move up a riser.

Feeding an animal will improve its mood and sate its appetite.

■Feed
There are three different types of animal feed available:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed, and premium island greenfeed.

Each feed can be crafted via the Sanctuary Crafting Log, and both types of greenfeed require produce yielded from the cropland.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>“Gleeful,” “Chipper,” “Content,” “Unhappy,” and “Hostile.”<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

"","Mastering the intricacies of isleworks production and trade begins with a close examination of the materials available to you and the strategic implementation of efficiency bonuses.

For those islekeeps who feel like they have a firm grasp on the basics, the following tips will help you take your island industry─and earnings─to the next level.


■Popular Items Sell Even Better When Scarce
When a handicraft has High or Very High popularity, the inclination may be to produce large quantities of it, as popularity increases selling price. However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.

By waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.

Demand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.


■Start the Season Short and Efficient
Levels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.

To quickly activate efficiency bonuses, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Strategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>","","","True","0x00000312","",""

"","The Path to Profits","","","False","0x00000314","",""
"","With an agenda in hand and a team of eager mammets at your disposal, you are free to make any and all handicrafts your heart desires. However, a very special bonus awaits those who choose their schedules cleverly.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>The efficiency bonus will double the production of a given handicraft without requiring additional materials or production time.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

Doubling the production of a handicraft means you will have two handicrafts to export, and basic mathematics tells us that two handicrafts will sell for twice as much as one handicraft will. So what are you waiting for? Activate those efficiency bonuses by following the steps below!

■Activating Efficiency Bonuses
All handicrafts belong to at least one item category, such as “Concoctions” or “Confections.”

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Efficiency bonuses are activated by scheduling the production of similarly categorized items in direct succession.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

For example, an isleworks potion and isleworks firesand are both classified as “Concoctions.” By scheduling production of isleworks firesand right after your isleworks potion, you will activate an efficiency bonus that creates two pinches of isleworks firesand with the same time and materials it would normally take to make one!

But you don't have to keep track of all your bonuses in that steel-trap mind of yours─the text “Efficiency Bonus!” will appear on the agenda for items that will be produced twice as a result of your clever scheduling.","","","False","0x00000315","",""
"","But wait! There's more.

What if you scheduled an isleworks potion, followed by a pinch of isleworks firesand, followed by <var 1A 02 /var>another<var 1A 01 /var> isleworks potion?

Thanks to efficiency bonuses, what might have been only three handicrafts has now been expanded to five! Think of the profits! Keep in mind both the type and order of handicrafts you add to your agenda, and you will be swimming in an abundance of seafarer's cowries in no time.

■Limitations of the Efficiency Bonus
Unfortunately, due to the peculiarities of the mammet's psyche, your tiny workers will not be nearly as excited making the same item twice in a row. While an isleworks potion/isleworks firesand combination will earn you an efficiency bonus, an order of isleworks potion/isleworks potion will get you nothing but some blinking and basic adherence to general protocol.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>In other words, only different items belonging to the same category can activate efficiency bonuses.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

When aiming for bonuses, be sure you are scheduling different handicrafts. Variety, after all, is the spice of island life.","Но подождите! Это ещё не всё.

Что, если вы запланировали isleworks potion, затем щепотку isleworks firesand, затем <var 1A 02 /var>снова<var 1A 01 /var> isleworks potion?

■Ограничения бонуса эффективности
К сожалению, из-за особенностей психики мамметов ваши крошечные работники не будут с таким же удовольствием делать один и тот же предмет два раза подряд.

The crystal line intersects with these ringlike nests at checkpoints. Clearing any such checkpoint with the tactical crystal in tow will result in one of the following denizens emerging from within:

・Red Sands Antlion
The antlion will drag all players in range deep into the nest, rendering them immobile before erupting from the sands to deal massive damage.

・Sabotender
The sabotender will unleash 100,000 Needles upon all players in range. As the needles are split between affected players, the damage dealt to each player will change accordingly.

・Acutender
This rare and curious creature will unleash Therapeutic Needles upon all players in range, granting them a barrier effect. As the needles are split between affected players, the strength of the barrier granted to each player will change accordingly.

・HP recovery.
・A boost to the limit gauge.

While the geyser is erupting, no creatures will emerge from the sandpit. Nevertheless, caution is advised, as the force of the geyser will deal damage to and knock back any who approach its center.","","","True","0x000003DD","",""
