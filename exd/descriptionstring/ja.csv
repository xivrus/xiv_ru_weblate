Players begin with 13 tiles and draw a new tile each turn. They must then choose a tile to discard: either the new tile or one of the tiles in their hand. The player to the right then takes a turn, and the process is repeated until the end of the hand.

The first player to complete a winning hand is awarded points. A total of eight hands are played in a full match and four in a quick match, and the player who finishes with the most points is declared the winner.

最初の手番のプレイヤーには新しく1枚牌が配られるので、いらない牌を1枚捨てます。次に右隣のプレイヤーにも同様に1枚牌が配られるのでいらない牌を1枚捨てる、これを繰り返してゲームは進行していきます。

1枚配られてきた14枚で「完成の形」が最初にできたプレイヤーがそのフェーズの勝ちとなり、点数を受け取ります。このフェーズを繰り返し、半荘戦では8回のフェーズが、東風戦では4回のフェーズが終わった時点で点数が一番多い人が勝者となって１ゲームが終了します。

■Selling Items Equipped to Mannequins
Access the mannequin and choose “Select gear to sell” to open the Mannequin Shop Settings window. Only sellable items in your inventory, Armoury Chest, or retainer inventory may be selected.

Any items equipped on a mannequin that are listed for sale still occupy slots in the retainer's list. For that reason, a mannequin cannot be equipped with items that would cause the retainer to exceed the 20 item limit.

By checking “Sell Only as Set,” you can sell all items equipped to the mannequin together. While the items may be viewed on the market board, a player must access the mannequin directly if they wish to purchase the set.

When viewing items listed on the market board as part of a set, it is possible to send a tell to the seller to ascertain the location of their estate.

■Displaying Gear
You may also display items on a mannequin without listing the gear for sale. It is also possible to select unsellable items for display.

"","■Basic Rules
Up to 24 players may join an Ocean Fishing voyage, solo or in parties of up to eight members. Players will be matched together to form a full party when participating solo or with a party of fewer than eight members. Each voyage will sojourn at three locations before returning to Limsa Lominsa.

■How to Participate
Speak with Dryskthota at the ferry docks to register as a crew member and board the <var 1A 02 /var>Endeavor<var 1A 01 /var>. Registration periods last for 15 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time). If registering as a party, the party leader must register. The ship will depart when 24 crew members have been assembled or the registration period has ended, even if there are fewer than 24 crew members. Registration times may be viewed from the Sailing Schedule.

Progressing through the main scenario will give access to an additional route known as the Ruby route. Details on how to  unlock this route can be found from the Sailing Schedule.

■Rewards
By meeting certain conditions while fishing during the voyage, players will receive achievements that reward special titles, mounts, and minions. Fishers who are level 50 or above and have completed the requisite quest may also receive gatherers' scrips as rewards.","■基本情報
オーシャンフィッシングには、ソロ、またはパーティで参加でき、
一度の航海で、最大24人まで乗船可能です。
ソロ、または8人未満のパーティで乗船した場合、
コンテンツ内で、自動的にフルパーティ（8人）が組まれます。
1度の航海で「3ヶ所」の海域を巡り、リムサ・ロミンサへと戻っていきます。

■参加方法
エンデバー号へは、フェリードックの「ドリスクトータ」から、
「乗船受付」を行うことで乗り込むことができます。
乗船受付は、（地球時間）2時間おきに「15分間」行うことができます。
パーティで受付をする場合はパーティリーダーが、
ソロで受付をする場合は自身で、受付をする必要があります。
受付後、乗船人数である24人に達するごとに船が用意され出港していきます。
また、受付人数が24人に満たない場合でも、
受付開始時刻から15分が経過した段階で出港となります。
なお、受付開始時刻は、「運行表」より確認できます。

メインクエストを進行することで、
「遠洋行きの航路」に乗船できるようになります。
これ以降、乗船時に「近海行きの航路」と「遠洋行きの航路」の２つの航路から、
向かいたい航路を選択してから出港することになります。
航路の開放条件については、「運行表」より確認できます。

■報酬
船上での釣りにより、特定の条件を満たすことで、
アチーブメント報酬として称号やミニオン、マウントなどが入手できます。

Lost actions are special abilities that can only be used in Save the Queen areas.

There are a variety of lost actions to be found, some requiring a certain Resistance rank before they can be used. Any lost actions you have obtained will be automatically stored in the lost finds cache.

■Uses and Restrictions
There are six types of lost actions: offensive, defensive, restorative, beneficial, tactical, and detrimental. In certain cases, they may also be used as items rather than traditional actions.

To begin, enable Feed mode from the islekeep's index, then approach an animal in the pasture equipped with the feed item of your choice to give it the tasty treat it deserves.

Feeding an animal will improve its mood and sate its appetite.

■Feed
There are three different types of animal feed available:
island sweetfeed, island greenfeed, and premium island greenfeed.

Each feed can be crafted via the Sanctuary Crafting Log, and both types of greenfeed require produce yielded from the cropland.

■Food
Animals have the following four stages of appetite:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>“Stuffed,” “Satisfied,” “Hungry,” and “Starving.”<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
An animal's appetite increases with time, and its mood worsens in parallel.

Any type of feed can satiate an animal until it is stuffed, and animals cannot be fed if already stuffed.

■Mood
Animals have the following five moods:
<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>“Gleeful,” “Chipper,” “Content,” “Unhappy,” and “Hostile.”<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
When an animal is starving, its mood will become hostile. Nourish animals in your care with food to improve their mood, and you may gather more leavings─among other boons!─in return.

Unlike appetite, an animal's mood is affected by the type of feed given to it.

・Island Sweetfeed

"","Mastering the intricacies of isleworks production and trade begins with a close examination of the materials available to you and the strategic implementation of efficiency bonuses.

For those islekeeps who feel like they have a firm grasp on the basics, the following tips will help you take your island industry─and earnings─to the next level.


■Popular Items Sell Even Better When Scarce
When a handicraft has High or Very High popularity, the inclination may be to produce large quantities of it, as popularity increases selling price. However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.

By waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.

Demand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.


■Start the Season Short and Efficient
Levels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.

To quickly activate efficiency bonuses, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Strategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>","開拓工房での、生産と諸島貿易を極めるのは容易ではありません。

まずは、自分が所持している材料を吟味し、
あわせて生産のボーナスを活かして、
できるだけ沢山の島産品を出荷することを目指してみましょう。

下記は、開拓工房と諸島貿易の基礎を理解したうえで、
さらなる高みを目指すためのテクニック集です！


■人気のある島産品を、供給不足のサイクルで沢山出荷する！
人気・大人気の島産品は、高い売り上げが期待できるため、
最大限の数を生産してしまいがちです。

しかし、大量に出荷し過ぎると、
数サイクル後には供給過多に陥ってしまい、
結果として思うような売り上げにつながりません。

人気のある島産品は、需要が普通の時は生産を控え、
超供給不足になったサイクルを狙って、生産・出荷しましょう。

需要変化を確認すれば、供給不足・超供給不足を予測することができます。
供給不足であることに加え、「需要が大きく増加」している島産品は、
翌サイクルに超供給不足になる可能性が高いでしょう。


■期の始めは、生産時間が短いものを中心に生産する
工房のやる気は、
あわせて生産が発生すればするほど、早く上がります。

期の始め頃は、工房のやる気上昇を狙って、
生産時間の短い島産品で、たくさん「あわせて生産」を行えば、
結果的に、やる気が最大値になる期間が長くなります。

一方で、生産時間が長い島産品は、
総じて基本取引額が高い傾向にある為、
やる気が最大値の時に生産すると、
供給過多を避けつつ、高い利益を生むことが期待できます。

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>工房のやる気や生産時間など、複数の項目をよく見極め、

"","With an agenda in hand and a team of eager mammets at your disposal, you are free to make any and all handicrafts your heart desires. However, a very special bonus awaits those who choose their schedules cleverly.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>The efficiency bonus will double the production of a given handicraft without requiring additional materials or production time.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

Doubling the production of a handicraft means you will have two handicrafts to export, and basic mathematics tells us that two handicrafts will sell for twice as much as one handicraft will. So what are you waiting for? Activate those efficiency bonuses by following the steps below!

■Activating Efficiency Bonuses
All handicrafts belong to at least one item category, such as “Concoctions” or “Confections.”

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>Efficiency bonuses are activated by scheduling the production of similarly categorized items in direct succession.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>

For example, an isleworks potion and isleworks firesand are both classified as “Concoctions.” By scheduling production of isleworks firesand right after your isleworks potion, you will activate an efficiency bonus that creates two pinches of isleworks firesand with the same time and materials it would normally take to make one!

But you don't have to keep track of all your bonuses in that steel-trap mind of yours─the text “Efficiency Bonus!” will appear on the agenda for items that will be produced twice as a result of your clever scheduling.","開拓工房には、売り上げを大幅にアップする事ができる、
強力なボーナス効果があります。

それが「あわせて生産」です！
あわせて生産が発動すると、開拓工房の生産効率が上がり、

完成個数が2倍になれば、売り上げもそのぶん増加するため、
積極的に、あわせて生産の発動を狙ってみるとよいでしょう。

■あわせて生産の発動方法

島産品はそれぞれ、「薬品」「菓子」といった「島産品特性」を持っています。

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>同じ島産品特性を持つ島産品が、連続して生産されると、

どちらも「薬品」の島産品特性を持っています。

アイルポーションの次に、開拓工房の火薬が、
連続して生産されるようにスケジュールを設定すると、
あわせて生産が発動し、開拓工房の火薬の完成個数が2倍になります！

完成個数の増加が発生する島産品のスケジュールには、
「あわせて生産ボーナス！」が表示されます。","","False","0x00000315","",""

What if you scheduled an isleworks potion, followed by a pinch of isleworks firesand, followed by <var 1A 02 /var>another<var 1A 01 /var> isleworks potion?

Thanks to efficiency bonuses, what might have been only three handicrafts has now been expanded to five! Think of the profits! Keep in mind both the type and order of handicrafts you add to your agenda, and you will be swimming in an abundance of seafarer's cowries in no time.

■Limitations of the Efficiency Bonus
Unfortunately, due to the peculiarities of the mammet's psyche, your tiny workers will not be nearly as excited making the same item twice in a row. While an isleworks potion/isleworks firesand combination will earn you an efficiency bonus, an order of isleworks potion/isleworks potion will get you nothing but some blinking and basic adherence to general protocol.

<var 48 F201FA /var><var 49 F201FB /var>In other words, only different items belonging to the same category can activate efficiency bonuses.<var 49 01 /var><var 48 01 /var>
